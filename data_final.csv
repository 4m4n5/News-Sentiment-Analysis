The official described the action as a “surgery since the tumour had to be removed to prevent recurrence.” He claimed that this will result in a reduction of inflation as conspicuous consumption will come down.

6,2016-11-09,2.0,Demonetisation: Here's how you should exchange your cash,"Prime Minister Narendra Modi's announcement to demonetise Rs.500 and Rs.1,000 notes currently in use has caused a panic among the public. Here is an explainer from the RBI on what is all about. Why is this scheme introduced? The incidence of fake Indian currency notes of higher denomination has increased. For ordinary persons, the fake notes look similar to genuine notes, even though no security feature has been copied. The fake notes are used for anti-national and illegal activities. High denomination notes have been misused by terrorists and for hoarding black money. India remains a cash-based economy hence the circulation of fake Indian currency notes continues to be a menace. In order to contain the rising incidence of fake notes and black money, the scheme has been introduced. How much value will I get? You will get value for the entire volume of notes tendered at the bank branches / RBI offices. Can I get all in cash? No. You will get up to Rs.4,000 per person in cash irrespective of the size of tender and anything over and above that will be receivable by way of credit to bank account. A sum of Rs.4000 cash is insufficient for my needs. You can use balances in bank accounts to pay for other requirements by cheque or through electronic means of payments such as Internet banking, mobile wallets, IMPS and credit/debit cards. What if if I have only Jan-Dhan account? A JDY account holder can avail the exchange facility subject to the caps and other laid down limits in accordance with norms and procedures. Where can I go to exchange the notes? The exchange facility is available at all Issue Offices of RBI and branches of commercial banks/Regional Rural Banks/ Urban Cooperative Banks (
UCBs)/State Co-op banks or at any Head Post Office or Sub-Post Office. Need I go to my bank branch and not other banks’? For exchange up to Rs.4,000 in cash you may go to any bank branch with identity proof. For exchange of more than Rs.4,000, which will be credited to your bank account only, you may go any branch of a bank with which you have an account. To use other banks’ branches, you will need identity proof and your bank account details required for electronic fund transfer to your account. Can I go to any branch of my bank? Yes you can go to any branch of your bank. Can I go to any branch of any other bank? Yes, you can go to any branch of any other bank. In that case you have to furnish valid identity proof for exchange in cash; both valid identity proof and bank account details will be required for electronic fund transfer in case the amount to be exchanged exceeds Rs.4,000. I have no account but my relative / friend has an account, can I get my notes exchanged into that account? Yes, you can do that if the account holder relative/friend etc. gives you permission in writing. While exchanging, you should provide to the bank, evidence of permission given by the account holder and your valid identity proof. Should I go to bank personally or can I send the notes through my representative? Personal visit to the branch is preferable. In case it is not possible for you to visit the branch you may send your representative with an express mandate i.e. a written authorisation. The representative should produce authority letter and his / her valid identity proof while tendering the notes. Can I withdraw from ATM? It may take a while for the banks to recalibrate their ATMs. Once the ATMs are functional, you can withdraw from ATMs upto a maximum of Rs. 2,000 per card per day upto 18th November, 2016. The limit will be raised to Rs.4, 000 per day per card from November 19, 2016, onwards. Can I withdraw cash against cheque? Yes, you can withdraw cash against withdrawal slip or cheque subject to ceiling of Rs.10,000/- in a day within an overall limit of Rs.20,000/- in a week (including withdrawals from ATMs) up to November 24, 2016, after which these limits shall be reviewed. Can I deposit Specified Bank Notes through ATMs, Cash Deposit Machine or cash Recycler? Yes, specified bank notes can be deposited in cash deposits machines / cash recyclers. Can I make use of electronic (NEFT/RTGS /IMPS/ Internet Banking / Mobile banking etc.) mode? You can use NEFT/RTGS/IMPS/Internet Banking/Mobile Banking or any other electronic/ non-cash mode of payment. How much time do I have to exchange the notes? The scheme closes on December 30, 2016. The specified bank notes can be exchanged at branches of commercial banks, Regional Rural Banks, Urban Cooperative banks, State Cooperative Banks and RBI till December 30, 2016. For those who are unable to exchange their specified bank notes on or before December 30, 2016, an opportunity will be given to them to do so at specified offices of the RBI, along with necessary documentation as may be specified by the Reserve Bank of India. I am right now not in India, what should I do? If you have specified bank notes in India, you may authorise in writing enabling another person in India to deposit the notes into your bank account. The person so authorised has to come to the bank branch with the specified bank notes, the authority letter given by you and a valid identity proof (Valid Identity proof is any of the following: Aadhaar Card, Driving License, Voter ID Card, Pass Port, NREGA Card, PAN Card, Identity Card Issued by Government Department, Public Sector Unit to its Staff) I am an NRI and hold Non Resident Ordinary Rupee (NRO) account, can the exchange value be deposited in my account? Yes, you can deposit the specified bank notes to your NRO account. I am a foreign tourist, I have these notes. What should I do? You can purchase foreign exchange equivalent to Rs.5,000 using these specified bank notes at airport exchange counters within 72 hours after the notification, provided you present proof of purchasing the specified bank notes. I have emergency needs of cash (hospitalisation, travel, life saving medicines) then what I should do? You can use the specified bank notes for paying for your hospitalisation charges at government hospitals, for purchasing bus tickets at government bus stands for travel by state government or state PSU buses, train tickets at railway stations, and air tickets at airports, within 72 hours after the notification. What is proof of identity? Valid Identity proof is any of the following: Aadhaar Card, Driving License, Voter ID Card, Pass Port, NREGA Card, PAN Card, Identity Card Issued by Government Department, Public Sector Unit to its Staff. If I have a problem, whom should I approach? You may approach the control room of RBI by on Telephone Nos 022 22602201/022 22602944 What are the points I should bear in mind? Since it is a massive exercise there is going to lot of confusion till the new currencies come into circulation totally and banks and ATMs are fully prepared for this. You need to cope with limited availability of notes and use the cash smartly. Also there is no clarity whether you can use multiple banks to exchange notes, since the limit is Rs.4,000 per person. Also IT Department would be keep a close watch on the deposits, so have clear proof of the source of money you are depositing.

South Central Railway General Manager Ravindra Gupta on Wednesday said that smooth arrangements were needed as Government of India had permitted Indian Railways to accept the high-denomination currency notes till November 11. He said that this being the case, passengers should be allowed to transact with the same at railway stations to buy their tickets, food and refreshments.

8,2016-11-09,2.0,"Petty fights, long queues at petrol outlets mark day after demonetisation of notes","crammed: Petrol bunks in many cities and towns, including Hubballi, were packed on Wednesday.   Despite clarification from the Union government on the ways to encash currency notes of Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,000 denomination, many people appeared confused about the matter on Wednesday and got into petty quarrels with traders. Meanwhile, serpentine queues were seen in front of petrol stations in the districts of north and central Karnataka. The most affected were the small businessmen, street vendors and the common man, many of whom were still not sure about what to do with the high-denomination notes in hand. Those who had heard about the demonetisation of Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,000 notes wanted to dispose them of as early as possible. In buses, for example, there were quarrels after commuters gave Rs. 500 notes to bus conductors for tickets costing below Rs. 100. Left with no option, a few conductors forced passengers to alight at the bus stations. At the weekly sante (bazaar) at Lingarajnagar in Hubballi, vegetable vendors and buyers got into altercations, and elders of the locality had to step in to resolve the arguments. In cities and towns across north Karnataka, long queues were seen in front fo petrol bunks as both the high-denomination notes were accepted there. However, after obliging initially, many petrol station owners asked vehicle owners to either purchase fuel for Rs. 500 or Rs. 1,000 or pay in change. In Chitradurga, by afternoon petrol bunk owners were giving change only to those buying fuel for more than Rs. 300. Medical stores in hospitals were also full of people purchasing medicines for Rs. 25 or Rs. 50 just to get change. In Vijayapura, petty shops and eateries witnessed dull business as people chose not to spend notes of lower denomination. And the case was no different in bigger shops that deal only in cash. However, many people felt that while they would be inconvenienced for a few days, the move would ultimately help in curbing black money.

9,2016-11-09,2.0,Social media erupts in the hours after demonetisation,"KOCHI: Social media had only one topic trending in the hours after the Centre announced the demonetisation of Rs.500 and Rs.1,000 notes on Tuesday night as in one sweep, it upstaged the entire debate about the US presidential election. Soon after posts alerting to the declaration of demonetisation by the Prime Minister, a no-holds-barred social media spar of trolls between pro-Modi and anti-Modi camp followers erupted. This was interspersed with serious posts for and against the view that the move would check black money. But the most entertaining were posts and trolls by people who owed allegiance to neither camp but tried to find the funny side of a new dawn without the ‘big’ notes. One such troll made a mock request to Prime Minister Modi on behalf of Indian expats not to declare Indian passports invalid for travelling to India one fine midnight. There were plenty of trolls drawing link between demonetisation and the state of mind of political leaders. A former Chief Minister and his two Cabinet colleagues in the UDF government who are facing corruption charges were the pick of such trolls which said that they were yet to regain consciousness after collapsing on hearing the declaration. Another post featured a dialogue from the blockbuster movie Aaram Thampuran delivered by Mohanlal that there would come a time when bundles of notes would not even have the value of paper. An aggrieved troller felt the government was beating up the entire population for the crime committed by a few by withdrawing currency notes all of a sudden. As posts emerged from a pro-BJP camp that the new currency notes to be launched were to feature nano GPS, that became the theme of a flurry of trolls. One seemingly innocuous post with dollops of sarcasm wondered whether the GPS in currency notes could be leveraged for Wi-Fi connectivity. Another troll wanted to know whether those currency notes would have 13 mega pixel camera and such other features of a smart phone. Many posted images of wallets containing a few soiled Rs.10 notes and coins with the caption that it was one of those rare moments when being poor felt being good. Malayalees’ penchant for ‘spirited’ trolls came to the fore as there appeared ones which downplayed the information on places where the banned notes would be accepted with a query whether they would be accepted at Bevco outlets. “The most repeated question today is whether cards are accepted at Bevco outlets,” said another troll. As the day progressed and Donald Trump triumphed in the US Presidential election, demonetisation trolls gradually got replaced by more serious debates over the election results.

Salute @narendramodi Within minutes of the Prime Minister’s televised address Tuesday night, in which he announced the decision, long queues outside ATMs, last-minute purchase at retail outlets and petrol bunks could be seen.The Rs. 100 note and currencies of lesser denominations became suddenly precious. The real challenge came when the sun rose. ""I walked on foot for nearly 10 km as taxi drivers refused to take Rs. 500 note,"" wrote a reader to The Hindu. There were days when people disliked ATMs that ran out of higher denomination and ejected only Rs. 100 notes. But such ATMs were on demand on Tuesday night. There were those who withdrew Rs. 400 multiple times in order to avoid getting the freshly-banned Rs. 500 notes.  ""Totally uncalled for chaos at ATM. They should have dispensed only smaller denominations and this (exercise) could have been done on weekend,"" pointed out another reader. One reader wrote why the Rs. 500 denomination is so important: ""Thousand rupee currency's validity doesn't feel so critical but Rs. 500 notes are crucial. As a person from middle class society, we often deal in 100s and 500s mostly. The amount most of us withdraw from ATM is Rs.500. Now suddenly as it has gone invalid, we feel like handicap."" ""Mind started to feel that 'Money has no value'. Can't even think of going to hotel, when thinking of 2*100 Rupee notes in the wallet along with few worthless 500 Rupee notes,"" the reader added. ""I have only Rs. 30 (in smaller denomination)."" and ""I am thinking twice before spending those precious 100rs notes,"" were among the common themes in reader replies. As banks and ATMs were closed for the day, the easier option was to head to the nearest petrol pump with higher denomination notes. At least that was what many thought. But fuel stations soon ran out of lower denomination currency and were willing to sell fuel only to those who were filling for Rs. 500. ""I tried filling petrol in my nearest petrol bunk. He says either fill for Rs. 500 flat or give exact change. My scooter can hold only four litres. This is legal extortion,"" wrote a reader. Auto rickshaw drivers in Chennai were seen pooling money and sharing fuel. Scooters and motorbike riders were also using the same formula. But the queues were getting bigger and several stations ran out of fuel mid-day. The usually-busy sabji mandis in big cities wore a deserted look. ""I am accepting Rs 500 notes only from customers who will buy vegetable worth Rs 450, said Balram, a Delhi-based vendor to Shiv Sunny, our Delhi reporter.

12,2016-11-09,2.0,"Farmers, street vendors most hit by demonetisation","In markets in the city, street hawkers and eatery owners looked tired of answering the question, ""Do you have change for Rs. 500?"" Business was dull at major markets in the city. Ayaan, a shoe shop seller from Commercial Street, said, ""What about the small street vendors who don't have bank accounts? They will need to open an account, clear income tax forms to get money now, it's just not sensible."" However although most shopkeepers looked down that business was poor, they felt it was a good move in the long run. At Russell Market, hoteliers saw low business and some refused people who came with Rs. 500 bills. Farmers hit most Farmers who have supplied foodgrains and vegetables to wholesale markets, but crippled to take a cheque or bank payments, are the most hit by the currency demonetisation. Most of such farmers have now got credit bills from traders. However, they may have to wait for a long time before their credit bills are settled in cash, as there is a withdrawal limit from banks at Rs. 20,000 a week. Farmer leader Kodihalli Chandrashekhar, said that only the large land holders would have bank accounts and such sudden demonetisation and bank withdrawal limits, push the small farmers already suffering from failed crops to the wall. ""We demand that the withdrawal limits be relaxed so that the farmers are paid in earnest,"" he said. A day's loss too heavy for them For the vendors who live on the streets, even a one day loss of sales could mean going to sleep on an empty stomach. Sixty five year old Kamalamma selling outside Bangalore Fort was almost in tears as she looked at her wilted greens. ""I have not made one sale the whole day,"" she said. She has no family of her own and doesn't have a bank account. Those selling non-essential items like knick knacks and combs were worst hit, with people unwilling to shell out change for such items. ""No one has change to buy my wigs, they have been made with hair from Tirupati,"" said Vasantha, who sells wigs near the fort. All dues paid In a decoration shop in KR Market, four men sit on the floor with bags filled with cash. ""These boys work for my brother who has a hardware shop. Usually when they go to collect dues they get around Rs. 5000 in dues from each customer, today people have paid as much as Rs. 50,000,"" said Ramesh Kumar. At the generic medicine store in Victoria Hospital, Rs. 500 bills were being accepted for payments more than Rs. 300. Hospitals were accepting demonitised bills as they have been instructed by the government to do so.

13,2016-11-09,2.0,Demonetisation causes cash famine in Malabar,"Business was in low gear across the north Kerala region on Wednesday as merchants and traders tried to make sense of the demonetisation and shoppers and customers struggled hard to cope with the shortage of legal-tender money with them. People woke up to the reality that most of the cash they had with them were of no use immediately. Towns and cities in the region soon realised that they were in the grip of a financial famine. Kozhikode, the hub of Malabar’s trade, was under a partial commercial paralysis as the banks were shuttered, ATMs were closed and people had no money to pay for their transactions. S.M. Street in Kozhikode, the largest retail shopping centre in the entire Malabar, reflected the gloom. The area, usually bursting at the seams with shoppers, was not crowded on Wednesday. Businesses reported that sales were down to less than a half as they could not accept Rs.500 and Rs.1,000 notes. There was a heavy decline in the wedding-related purchases which are referred to as ‘marriage shopping.’ As the banks and ATMs were closed, the customers were not able to take out cash to pay for high-volume purchases. However, larger shops in S.M. Street and the upmarket ones across the city that accept credit and debit cards said there was an increase in business using the cards. Reports from Kannur, Kasaragod, Vadakara, Kanjangad, Kalpetta and many other towns indicated a marked decline in business. In the eastern upland areas, sale and purchase of agricultural products were heavily hit. A natural-rubber trader at Thiruvambadi in Kozhikode district said that he had withdrawn Rs.2 lakh, all in 500s, from his bank last evening. But, since the cash was of no use on Wednesday morning, he opted not to open his shop. Land-deal registrations across the region was crippled as the parties could not pay the registration fee and related expenses to the government in cash. For instance, at a sub-registrar office (SRO) in Kozhikode city, none of the nine registrations scheduled did not take place. A document writer told The Hindu that his client had got around Rs.5 lakh ready in 500s and 1,000s on Tuesday itself to be paid as stamp duty and registration fee. However, registration of wills and partition deeds were done as the expenses were small. Some restaurants in the city had to close in the afternoon as their customers could not pay up in small-denomination notes. Petrol pumps, which were allowed to accept the demonetised notes, however, supplied fuel for Rs.500 or its multiples.

14,2016-11-09,2.0,Plea in SC seeks quashing of demonetisation decision,"A man sorts Rs. 1000 and Rs. 500 currency notes at a fuel pump in Ahmedabad on Tuesday.
  A petition was filed in the Supreme Court on Wednesday seeking a judicial order quashing the government’s decision to “immediately discontinue” the circulation of Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,000 currency notes and give the poor a reasonable opportunity to organise their lives. The writ petition filed by Supreme Court advocate Sangam Lal Pandey is likely to be mentioned for an early hearing. The scrapping of the high-denomination currency was implemented from November 8-9 midnight after Prime Minister Narendra Modi said the government was constrained to take this measure to fight the black money menace. Mr. Pandey’s petition terms the announcement a “Tughlaki Farman” — a term fashioned after the medieval Indian ruler Mohammed bin Tughlaq whose decisions to change the capital from Delhi and currency had boomeranged. The petition sought to “quash this illegal and arbitrary announcement without giving any opportunity to the poor citizens of India.” Alternative arrangements

It has asked the apex court to direct the government “to provide a stipulated time to citizens for making alternative arrangements for necessary activities, may it be medical, educational, weddings, farming, etc.” Mr. Pandey, who is a party in person, claimed to have received information that several private hospitals have refused to take payment in cash. This may delay “serious operations,” he said. He said thousands of weddings scheduled from November 9 to 11 might have to be cancelled. “A large number of people are suffering,” the petition said.

15,2016-11-09,2.0,"Currency in hand, they starved","The sudden demonetisation move on Tuesday night turned out be a harrowing experience for a group of tourists from Kollam. The tourists, mostly retired Kerala State Road Transport Corporation employees, were on a tour to northern India. They started their journey on Tuesday afternoon by Kerala Express. Their nightmare began when they had supper from pantry car. The pantry car operators, on a directive from their bosses, refused to accept Rs.1,000 and Rs.500 notes. The tourists and and their tour operator mostly carried Rs. 1,000 notes and they were unable to purchase food and other requirements. The entire group and even many commuters virtually starved as they could not have proper breakfast or lunch. Tour operator G. Thomaskutty, from the Thenmala Tourism Development Cooperative Society, said over the phone that since most of travellers carried notes in higher denominations, the pantry car operators even restricted the menu to snacks and tea for lunch. With the small amount of lower denomination notes, they bought snacks and shared it among themselves. Even eateries at stations such as Vijayawada refused to accept Rs.1,000 and Rs.500 notes, he said. Their destination is Agra where the train is scheduled to arrive late on Thursday morning. Mr. Thomaskutty said the tour agent at Agra informed him that things would be difficult there too, with curbs on ATM withdrawals. The group is scheduled to reach Kollam on November 17.

16,2016-11-09,2.0,Currency crisis hits commoners hard,"THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Across Kerala, like elsewhere in the country, the impact of the demonetisation of Rs. 500 and Rs. 1000 currency notes on the daily lives of people was frustrating, annoying and confusing, depending on which good or service they sought. At the Central railway station in the capital, there were many who arrived with Rs, 1000 notes to purchase platform tickets for Rs. 5. “It came as an iruttadi (bolt from the blue) for me as I need to make a series of small and medium purchases for the wedding of my sister’s daughter next week,” a harried man, who cursed himself for withdrawing Rs. 4 lakh in cash, all in 500s and 1000s, from a bank three days ago, told The Hindu in Kozhikode on Wednesday. “I came to know aboutthe demonetisation only this morning as I had missed the TV news last night.” He still made it to S.M. Street here with a bundle of Rs. 500 notes hoping to make some purchases, but was rebuffed by the shops. Welcoming the demonetisation step taken by the Centre, former UN financial expert and corporate finance consultant T.S. Anantharaman said in Thrissur that the move will help to check the flow of hawala money. “Most of the NRIs, especially in the lower strata of society, depend on hawala transactions. They mainly use the currency notes of denominations 500 and 100 for their transactions. Though the move will cause some issues in the initial stage, it will benefit in the long run,” he said. But, in the interim, confusion reigns. “There are customers who have withdrawn large sums for marriage functions scheduled on November 10, 11 and 12. They have contacted us for guidelines, but we are clueless, said Padmakumar, a bank employee and leader of Bank Employees’ Federation of India in Alappuzha. “There is no intimation yet as to when we would get the new currency notes,” he said, hinting at the disorder awaiting the bank branches. “Trading is virtually at a standstill”, says Sabil Raj, Alappuzha district general secretary of Kerala Vyapari Vyavasayi Ekopana Samithy. ‘The decision will cause some inconvenience for the farmers for a short but critical harvesting period, it is a welcome moe, says Prasanth Rajesh, Wayanad Coffee Growers’ Association president. Shaji Mullookkaran, an engineer engaged in providing support service for power inverters installed at various banking institutions across Palakkad district, said it was his affinity for plastic money that helped him adhere to schedules on Wednesday. “It was a big relief on Tuesday night when a leading grocery shop in Palakkad with credit card facility sent its customers SMS saying that it would function till midnight. I went there at 11.30 pm to buy vegetables and other essentials. Decided not to become part of the long queue at ATMs on Tuesday night as I can fill fuel in my car using credit and debit cards. During lunch time, I opted to be in Ottappalam so that I can swipe my card at the restaurant there. It may be difficult to swipe card at restaurant if I had to go to any interior area at noon,'' he said.

17,2016-11-09,2.0,Demonetisation spells confusion for Kochiites,"KOCHI: The day’s trail to know the impact of the sudden demonetisation of Rs.500 and Rs.1,000 currency notes had just begun. Time was 10.48 a.m. on Wednesday. Sitting in his nondescript vegetable shop near the entrance to the normally bustling Kaloor market, Jamaal wore a confused look. Just a while ago a couple of his trusted clients had paid in Rs.500 notes on shopping. “They were regulars and could not be turned away unlike people who came in the guise of customers looking for change. The real impact will be known only by Thursday when suppliers return after today’s [Thursday] motor strike,” he said. At his abattoir a few metres away, Shiraas continued to accept ‘banned’ notes. “We have no black money to hide and therefore can change these notes at the bank. Business is already bad, and we can’t afford to turn our customers away citing the note issue,” he said. At Saritha theatre, hardly 4 km away, moviegoers had to check their wallets for Rs.100 or lower denomination notes. “No question of accepting bigger notes as they are no longer legal tender,” Sethunath, theatre manager, put it bluntly. There was a minor melee during the previous night’s second show. Alerted to the withdrawal of Rs.500 and Rs.1,000 notes, spectators started bombarding the canteen with the notes, Mathew, a ticket counter staff, recalled. At his roadside kiosk near the theatre, Noufal sat idling away his time. With just three Rs.100 notes in his cash box, he could neither buy fresh stock nor do any business. He had to turn away quite a few customers who had come with banned notes. It was 11.22 a.m., and Benjamin looked around his deserted medical shop, which usually teems with customers. With the business having been hit, he had already started accepting cards for as low a purchase as Rs.10, while the minimum purchase through card swipe normally is Rs.200. Anand, an employee at the Supplyco-run petrol pump near Durbar Hall Ground, expected more trouble as motorists streamed in. The lower denomination notes had literally exhausted, and customers were agitated over the failure of the outlet to tender balance. “We told them they could fill petrol for Rs.500 or Rs.1,000, but for anything less, we insisted that they give change,” he said. At just past 12 noon, the “note issue” dominated the chat between staff and passengers at the Ernakulam KSRTC depot. “Some depots had started exhibiting placards declaring that Rs.500 and Rs.1,000 notes were not accepted, though we haven’t done it as yet,” said station master Viswambaran. Conductors accepted banned notes as long as they had enough change to return balance and at times issued slips denoting that the balance be collected from depots later. But that was not possible on long routes, said Saji, a conductor. At Bevco’s self-serving premium outlet just a stone’s throw away beyond the A.L. Jacob flyover, employees had a leisurely day. With a board kept outside declaring that Rs.500 and Rs.1,000 notes and credit/debit cards were not accepted, sales were reduced to a trickle at the outlet, which usually logs a daily business of over Rs.10 lakh. “We mostly deal with notes of higher denomination since we sell premium brands. We are receiving inquiries asking whether such notes can be changed at our outlets,” said Nijesh, an employee. Shiju had been operating the automatic ticket vending machine at the eastern entry of the south railway station for hours by the time the clock ticked past 12.30 p.m. He held the Rs.500 and Rs.1,000 notes in one hand as if they were a testimony to his helplessness. “Passengers can either wait till enough change is collected to get the balance on buying tickets, or they can give change,” he said and passengers seem convinced. But it was a different story at ticket counters at the main entrance where heated arguments became the order of the day even as some agitated passengers threatened to lay siege to counters.

18,2016-11-09,2.0,Demonetisation triggers panic,"People crowding a petrol pump near Millennium petrol bunk at Siripuram with Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 currency notes for topping up their vehicle tanks in Visakhapatnam on Wednesday.   There was unprecedented rush and chaos witnessed at several major petrol bunks in the city from the early hours of Wednesday, following the Central government’s announcement on Tuesday night of demonetisation of Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes. This triggered a panic reaction among people, who thronged petrol bunks that were one of the few places which the Central government had announced can accept the demonetised currencies. While some of the petrol bunks accepted the currency notes, a few of the smaller ones turned away customers or reportedly remained non-operational. Petrol bunks have been instructed to take these currencies until November 11. Many felt it was too short a notice for the common man to make arrangements for their daily needs. What added to panic was the announcement that banks will remain closed on Wednesday and ATMs for the next two days. “We were caught unaware. Most of us have to step out early in the morning for work and adding to the problems, there was hardly any petrol left in my vehicle. I had to stand in long queues for more than an hour to fill petrol,” said V. Sandeep, an IT professional. At places like Siripuram, serpentine queues trickled on to the Andhra University main road in the morning. Many people came together to pool in the bills and filled petrol as none of the petrol bunks were giving change of Rs 100 currency note, which turned into a hot commodity. I. Padmavathi, a resident of Kancharapalem, came with four others to fill petrol at the bunk near IV Town Police Station. “My vehicle tank is small. So we could give a Rs 500 note by sharing petrol among five people,” she added. At some petrol bunks, agitated commuters were seen involved in heated arguments with the staff who refused to accept the currency notes. With the demand for Rs 100 notes suddenly escalating, some petrol bunk salesmen who accepted Rs 500 currency note for filling petrol for Rs 400 were seen returning Rs 90, pocketing the additional Rs 10. Meanwhile, many senior citizens were in a state of panic. V. Shanti Latha, a resident of Pandurangapuram, woke up to the news of demonetisation of the currency notes with no lower denomination notes left with her to buy the daily groceries. “My son and daughter-in-law had to go to Hyderabad on a short tour so I was left with no help. I do not know how to operate the internet nor do I have a debit card,” said the 75-year-old. Fortunately, her neighbour came to her help and ordered from an e-commerce grocery store for the next two days supplies. Some others like T. Sujatha (65) were turned away from Apollo Medicals when she gave a note of Rs 1,000 to purchase her diabetes medicines. However, the general opinion of the public on PM’s sensational move was positive. “For a nation attempting to battle corruption, two days of financial inconvenience is not much of a collateral,” said P. Surya, PSU employee.

  The transition from old currency notes of Rs.1000 and Rs.500 denomination to new and more secure Rs.500 and Rs.2000 notes had a tell-tale impact on businesses across Vijayawada, right from the early hours of Wednesday. People had to withhold household cash transactions and even drop travel plans due to the short supply of Rs.100 and currency notes of smaller value that are to be exchanged for the existing series of Rs.1000 and Rs.500 notes. Cash registers at the railway reservation counters were ringing as usual but only to the extent the public tendered notes of Rs.100 and smaller denomination as the availability of small notes was a conspicuous problem here. The passengers were, however, unwilling to buy the railway staff’s ‘we-dont-have-change’ answer. Some of them had to run around for petty cash but to no avail. Similar scenes were witnessed at Pandit Nehru Bus Station and also during the travel in APSTRC buses. Serpentine queues were seen at toll plazas on the National Highways since dawn with the staff not accepting the banned currency. The problem was eased only after the Centre announced lifting of toll tax till November 11. ""The situation was bad at ticket-issuing counters as the staff insisted for Rs.100 and Rs.50 notes. Even at hotels and tea stalls on platforms, the demonetized notes were rejected, putting the passengers to a lot of trouble"", said Ram Naik, a railway commuter from Madhya Pradesh. At the Gannavaram airport, there was not much problem as there were only a small number of the air passengers who purchased tickets across the counters. On the other side, auto-rickshaw drivers were reluctant to accept the high-value notes from passengers. ""The auto-drivers were initially enquiring about the availability of Rs.100 and Rs.50 notes, otherwise they were not providing their service from the airport. The government should have taken proper measures for the exchange of small notes before taking its decision"", opined a passenger at the airport. The only places which were thronged by the public in large numbers were petrol bunks, where the phased-out currency notes were accepted. However, the paucity of smaller notes disrupted the business badly. It was a smooth going in hospitals which were mandated to accept the Rs.1000 and Rs.500 notes. Gold sale and purchase was stalled due to cancellation of the big notes and no customers were seen in these showrooms. Asked whether public can deposit Rs. 1000 and Rs.500 in post offices from Thursday, staff at Gandhinagar Post Office here said they can exchange notes once the Reserve Bank of India distributes new currency to post offices. Notwithstanding the teething problems posed by the new currency regime, there was, by and large, a consensus that it was a welcome decision by the Prime Minister Narendra Modi with the rider that more time should have been given for exchanging the ‘demonetised’ notes.

Party leader Botcha Satyanarayana said Prime Minister Narendra Modi taking the decision in the interest of curbing unaccounted for money was a welcome step. But, with huge number of 6.3 lakh villages and only 30,000 banks, doubts were being raised about the smooth transition. The Centre should take steps to ensure that daily wage earners and people in rural areas who were not exposed to banking transactions were not effected by the process. Given the fact that rural areas were not fully prepared for banking, steps should be initiated to ensure that the option given by the Centre for exchanging money through banks and post offices progressed smoothly. Asked about AP Chief Minster N. Chandrababu Naidu was aware of the decision as was reported in a section of the press, he said such talk would lead to nowhere and the focus should only be on ushering in the best practices.

  A day after Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced the scrapping of Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes, chaos reigned in the national capital as people struggled to gather change. The worst hit were the poorer lot as they were left with no money even to go about their daily routine. Many were even caught unaware of the finer details of the new rules as they approached anyone and everyone to seek instructions on what to do next. In West Delhi's Uttam Nagar, Amar Singh, a tempo cleaner, had no breakfast on Wednesday. ""I have Rs 9,000 in big notes, but just Rs 7 in loose change. I have just had tea, no breakfast.

S. S. Yuvaraj, vice chairman, Confederation of Indian Industry (CII), Salem district, said that the people never expected such an announcement and it has shell shocked people belonging to all walks of life. No doubt, all will face difficulties in the initial days. But everyone has to make some sacrifice in the interest of the nation, Mr. Yuvaraj said. As the Prime Minister rightly said that common people will positively support the move, he added. K. Mariappan, president of the Indian Chamber of Commerce and Industry, Salem, said that the move will hit not only the trade and industry, but also the common man. He said that the government would have done well by giving some time to the people to adjust themselves. The sudden closure of banks and ATMs will create unnecessary anxiety among the citizens. However, if the government has done it for protecting the interest of the country, the trade and industry will support it. Meanwhile, on hearing the announcement, people swamped the ATMs situated in their respective localities in the late evening hours. They preferred to withdraw Rs. 400 at a time to ensure that they get currency of Rs. 100 denomination only. Soon, many of the ATMs in Salem city and other parts of the district went dry. Many of the shops stopped receiving the Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,000 notes with immediate effect. Some of the shops received the same with a discount of certain percentage ranging from 10 to 30 per cent.

He had even shot off a letter to Mr. Modi. With Mr. Modi’s big announcement on Tuesday night, Mr. Naidu’s stand appears vindicated. Expectedly, Mr. Naidu lost no time in welcoming the decision of Mr. Modi. “The initiative will curb black money menace,” he said, while recalling the letter he had written to the Prime Minister on October 12 urging him to withdraw higher denomination of currency. On October 12, Mr. Naidu was addressing his first press conference from his new office in Interim Government Complex at Velagapudi.

  The Centre’s decision to withdraw Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,000 notes will hit hard the operations of fake currency gangs, reportedly operating from Pakistan and Bangladesh. Many such gangs pumped crores of counterfeit notes into the markets in the State. the police arrested many gangs at several places across the State in the last few years. In most of the cases, the gangs roped in mediators from Malda district in West Bengal, a border district with Bangladesh. The investigation officers apprehended several operators from the district. In 2014, the the Krishna district police busted a racket that had links in Pakistan and Bangladesh, arrested seven of the 11-member gang and seized huge quantity of fake currency from them. One Naik, a native of Raichur in Karnataka, engaged Jalasutram Venkanna of West Godavari district to circulate the notes. They exchanged fake notes at 1:3 ratio in Vizianagaram, Srikakulam, Rajahmundry, Bhubaneswar, Kolkata (Howrah) railway stations.

36,2016-11-09,2.0,Demonetisation triggers panic,"Usually deserted ATMs in rural Thiruvananthapuram saw long queues late in the night as ATMs across the country began closing down on Tuesday following the demonitisation of Rs.500 and Rs.1,000.   Panic was palpable on the streets across the State on Tuesday night following the sudden demonetisation of Rs.500 and Rs.1,000 currency notes with scores queueing up at ATM counters across the State and many who had immediate transaction needs or set out for long journeys finding themselves stranded without currency notes of lower denomination in their hands. With shopkeepers refusing to accept the Rs.500 and Rs.1,000 notes in their hands, many did not know what to do to meet their immediate needs. The shopkeepers themselves appeared confused about what they would do if they were to accept the currency notes though the transactions were legal. Those who waited before ATM counters were divided in their views about the measure, many terming it an unavoidable inconvenience in the larger interest of the nation, but a fairly large number viewing the measure uncalled for and the cause of a major worry for them. State Finance Minister T.M. Thomas Isaac came down heavily on the Central government’s decision, terming it “a mere drama” and a foolish act intended only to hoodwink the people. Black money, he said, is not hoarded in the form of currency and all that the government’s decision would do is to cause serious hardship to the people. Those without credit or debit cards would be really hit and worse would be the case of the State government’s financial transactions over the coming two days. “No economist whom I spoke to could see it as anything but a sham,” Dr. Isaac said. However, State Planning Board member K.N. Harilal said though the measure would cause hardship to the people in the interim, it would help check spread of black money. “It is a positive move, though the dip in transactions could have short-term implications for the economy over the next two weeks. The public would also have to go through a difficult time in the transition phase. But in the long term it is bound to cleanse the economy,” he said, and added that the measure could also help to check inflationary pressure as cash in circulation comes down. Welcoming the government decision, former Planning Board member G. Vijayaraghavan said it was bound to result in increased use of plastic money in the short term. “While the lack of availability of lower denomination notes is bound to create problems for the public over the next few days, it has to be seen as a bold assault on black money,” he said. Mr. Vijayaraghavan said the demonetisation could also have an impact on the real estate sector as land prices crash. “It would probably be followed by the introduction of currency of higher denomination,” he said.

38,2016-11-09,2.0,Demonetisation triggers panic,"Panic was palpable on the streets across the State on Tuesday night following the sudden demonetisation of Rs.500 and Rs.1,000 currency notes with scores queueing up at ATM counters across the State and many who had immediate transaction needs or set out for long journeys finding themselves stranded without currency notes of lower denomination in their hands. With shopkeepers refusing to accept the Rs.500 and Rs.1,000 notes in their hands, many did not know what to do to meet their immediate needs. The shopkeepers themselves appeared confused about what they would do if they were to accept the currency notes though the transactions were legal. Divided opinion Those who waited before ATM counters were divided in their views about the measure, many terming it an unavoidable inconvenience in the larger interest of the nation, but a fairly large number viewing the measure uncalled for and the cause of a major worry for them. State Finance Minister T.M. Thomas Isaac came down heavily on the Central government’s decision, terming it “a mere drama” and a foolish act intended only to hoodwink the people. Black money, he said, is not hoarded in the form of currency and all that the government’s decision would do is to cause serious hardship to the people. Those without credit or debit cards would be really hit and worse would be the case of the State government’s financial transactions over the coming two days. “No economist whom I spoke to could see it as anything but a sham,” Dr. Isaac said. However, State Planning Board member K.N. Harilal said though the measure would cause hardship to the people in the interim, it would help check spread of black money. “It is a positive move, though the dip in transactions could have short-term implications for the economy over the next two weeks. The public would also have to go through a difficult time in the transition phase. But in the long term it is bound to cleanse the economy,” he said, and added that the measure could also help to check inflationary pressure as cash in circulation comes down. Move hailed Welcoming the government decision, former Planning Board member G. Vijayaraghavan said it was bound to result in increased use of plastic money in the short term. “While the lack of availability of lower denomination notes is bound to create problems for the public over the next few days, it has to be seen as a bold assault on black money,” he said. Mr. Vijayaraghavan said the demonetisation could also have an impact on the real estate sector as land prices crash. “It would probably be followed by the introduction of currency of higher denomination,” he said. With shopkeepers refusing to accept Rs.500 and Rs.1,000 notes, many do not know what to do.

39,2016-11-09,2.0,"Industry, public shocked at demonetisation of Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,000","Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s announcement that Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,000 notes will cease to be legal tender from mid-night on Tuesday was received with shock and surprise by the representatives of trade and industry and the common public alike. “The announcement is incredible and is bound to cause hardship in the initial days”, they said. S. S. Yuvaraj, vice chairman, Confederation of Indian Industry (CII), Salem district, said that the people never expected such an announcement and it has shell shocked people belonging to all walks of life. No doubt, all will face difficulties in the initial days. But everyone has to make some sacrifice in the interest of the nation, Mr. Yuvaraj said. As the Prime Minister rightly said that common people will positively support the move, he added. K. Mariappan, president of the Indian Chamber of Commerce and Industry, Salem, said that the move will hit not only the trade and industry, but also the common man. He said that the government would have done well by giving some time to the people to adjust themselves. The sudden closure of banks and ATMs will create unnecessary anxiety among the citizens. However, if the government has done it for protecting the interest of the country, the trade and industry will support it. Meanwhile, on hearing the announcement, people swamped the ATMs situated in their respective localities in the late evening hours. They preferred to withdraw Rs. 400 at a time to ensure that they get currency of Rs. 100 denomination only. Soon, many of the ATMs in Salem city and other parts of the district went dry. Many of the shops stopped receiving the Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,000 notes with immediate effect. Some of the shops received the same with a discount of certain percentage ranging from 10 to 30 per cent.

The parties, the BJP’s main opponents in U.P., said the decision was taken by Prime Minister Narendra Modi keeping in mind the upcoming State elections.

43,2016-11-10,3.0,Fate of currency seized in ACB ?trap? cases hangs in balance,"Everyone is rushing to banks to deposit or exchange demonetised currency notes of Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,000 denominations. One Government wing, despite knowing that the currency notes would go waste if not changed now or in next few weeks, is unable to make any move. That is the strange situation of Anti-Corruption Bureau — the only State agency feared by corrupt government employees — has landed in following the Centre’s ban on currency notes of these two denominations. In the past several years, the ACB had seized several crores of rupees after catching government employees red-handed in trap cases. Cash is seized by ACB officials in two types of cases. After gathering ‘prima facie’ evidence that a government employee had amassed wealth illegally, they conduct raids and seize cash and other valuables. This cash is deposited in the banks and in safe custody of bankers. “In trap cases, these currency notes become clinching evidence to prove the employee is guilty,” an ACB officer explained. The investigators deposit the same as material evidence in the court. “The bribe sum varies from case to case,” the ACB officials said. In the light of the ban on currency notes, the investigators are aware that currency notes of Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,000 in the bribe sums would go waste if not exchanged or deposited in the bank. In this backdrop, the officials are exploring options to get the banned currency notes exchanged in compliance with legal formalities.

44,2016-11-10,3.0,Demonetisation: BJP flays State govt. stance,"BJP general secretary Ram Madhav, on Thursday, asked the Kerala government to make it clear if it stood with the poor or with hoarders of unaccounted money and fake currency racketeers. Condemning the State government’s criticism of demonetisation which, according to him, was a ‘transformative action’, Mr. Madhav said the government led by the CPI(M) opposed it for political expediency. “I have read in one [news]paper that Pinarayi Vijayan, when he was in the Opposition, accused [then] Chief Minister Oommen Chandy of corruption in the Vizhinjam project to the tune of Rs.6,000 crore. What’s that Rs.6,000 crore money? Is it not black money? Papers in this State have also reported that huge amounts of black money are stashed away in cooperative banks and Income Tax Department sources have given figures like Rs.30,000 crore. Doesn’t this bother the Finance Minister here? It’s that money, the illicit money that needs to be brought out (sic),” he said. Mr. Madhav also claimed that the Modi government had been able to bring out Rs.1,25,000 crore stashed away in tax havens abroad. He reiterated that the ban on higher denomination currency would unearth black money stored in hard cash, but was evasive about the measures taken to unearth the major part that would have already been funnelled into the system. As a measure to prevent currency counterfeiting, the government had introduced tighter security measures in the new currency bill of Rs.2,000, he claimed, maintaining that “it cannot be easily faked”. Asked about the futility of issuing higher denominations if the government’s intent was to check hoarding of black money, he said this was warranted as most legal transactions even now took place in cash. “And, we are moving towards a less-cash economy, not a cashless economy,” he announced, saying there would be more digital and plastic money transactions.

45,2016-11-10,3.0,"DRI to watch all incoming, outgoing foreign currency","Acting on intelligence, the Directorate of Revenue Intelligence (DRI) is keeping a close vigil on all incoming and outgoing foreign currency. The move is linked to the demonetisation of the Rs.500 and Rs.1,000 currency notes by the Centre on November 8, said sources. A DRI source revealed that individuals who hoard unaccounted cash might try to smuggle it out through the foreign currency route in the coming days. “That is our hunch right now, as the demonetisation might see more foreign currency coming in or going out. While foreign currency is not a problem as such, but there is a possibility that unaccounted cash can be changed through it for a premium,” added the source. The DRI source pointed out that people who hoard unaccounted cash cannot deposit huge sums in banks, as it will immediately rouse the Income Tax Department’s suspicion. The DRI officials are currently monitoring all ports, airports, seaports and and cargo container depots to keep a tab on incoming and outgoing foreign currency, said the source. A DRI official also said that demonetisation of the Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,000 currency notes has also dealt a huge blow to the fake currency cartels. “People with fake currency notes have no option but to destroy them. The only other option is to go to a bank for deposit, where it can easily be found out that the notes are fake,” he added. The official also informed that the circulation of fake currency had become a serious problem, as some of them were of ‘high-quality’, meaning that they could match about 8 to 9 of the security features out of 12 in comparison with genuine notes. “With fake notes gone, we are keeping a check on foreign currency. We will see how things transpire in the coming days,” he added.

46,2016-11-10,3.0,Currency exchange through sub post offices hit,"KOCHI: The exchange of Old High Denomination (OHD) notes through 71 sub post offices in the district was hit for the best part of the day after banks refused to issue them enough currency notes. However, banks were liberal with the two head post offices in Ernakulam and Fort Kochi because of which they did not face shortage of cash. Banks had adopted the stance that they would not transfer more than Rs.10,000 to each sub post office. Incidentally, such a stance was based on a rather irrational interpretation of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) direction that payment to account holders by banks should not exceed Rs.10,000 a day. “Obviously, banks did not differentiate between individual account holders and post offices and insisted on a separate order to change that position. We have written to the higher authorities about the situation,” senior Postal Department officials said. Thanks to the limited exchange facility at sub post offices, heavy rush was experienced at the Ernakulam Head Post Office from Thursday morning. Customers bemoaned that they would have been spared the ordeal had the exchange facility been made available at local post offices. There was another tough task in store for those who chose to exchange money through post offices. They had to write down the serial number of each currency bill they submitted for exchange, which turned out to be an onerous task especially for those who went with a fairly large number of bills.

  Hailing the Indian government’s decision of demonetising Rs. 500 and Rs. 1000 currency notes, the U.S. experts have said the success of this radical anti-corruption step would depend on its implementation. “This is a surprising and radical policy to get at the core of one of India’s problem corruption,” Puneet Manchanda, professor of marketing at the Ross School of Business, said. “The positives are that it signals clear intent and action to minimise corruption. The negatives are that it targets low and mid-level corruption, it is less likely that large-level corruption is heavy on cash,” he said. Markets such as real estate are likely to be slowed due to the lack of liquidity. Thus, it is hard to predict the short term effect, but it can only help in the medium term, he said. “In order to make this policy maximally effective, the government should continue to roll out other policies to fuel the fight against corruption,” Manchanda said. Vikramaditya Khanna, professor at University of Michigan Law School, said “How effective this measure will be in addressing corruption and unaccounted for money will depend in part on whether the most likely methods of evading it are being policed effectively. Time will only tell but it is a bold move to address a problem plaguing India for many years“. M S Krishnan, associate dean of global initiatives at the Ross School of Business, described this as an excellent move from Indian Government and said, “It will address many challenges they face such as unaccounted black money, corruption and fake currency“. “Over the last several months, government did offer opportunities for citizens to declare their wealth, so it was in the making. In the long run this will make it much easier and cleaner to do business in India,” Krishnan said. Reacting to the Indian government’s step, the Obama administration described this as an anti-corruption move. “It is an anti-corruption measure taken by the Modi government following a series of steps that the government has taken in the past years in an attempt to reduce counterfeit money or black money,” State Department Deputy Spokesman Mark Toner told reporters on Wednesday.

51,2016-11-10,3.0,Manik Sarkar flays demonetisation,"Tearing into Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s decision to demonetise Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 currency notes, Tripura Chief Minister Manik Sarkar on Wednesday said it was a “gimmick” to divert people’s attention from real problems. “The Prime Minister has announced that abolition of the notes of Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 would check corruption, control black money, fake notes and transactions of money by the terrorists. This is nothing but a gimmick or stunt to divert the attention of people of the country from real problems,” the Marxist leader told reporters here. Those who deal in black money do not keep the notes in their own houses, so demonetisation of the notes would not yield any result. “Terrorists transact money through banks so banning of the notes will not help in controlling them. This measure will also not help solving the menace of counterfeit currency, because after a few days the new notes would be faked,” he said. He alleged that at least Rs 11,000 crore was taken as loans from different banks by some capitalists and industrialists but they did not return the money and the government led by Modi was trying to save the borrowers. “Is it not corruption? Why did the government not take appropriate actions against them (borrowers) and why did the government not publish their names?” he said. The BJP-led NDA government at the Centre in its poll pledge assured that black money deposited in foreign banks would be brought back to the country within 100 days. “But at least 900 days have passed and the government did not even announce the names of those corrupt people who deposited their money in foreign banks,” he said. “The country is facing unemployment problems, suicide of farmers and inflation and failing to solve these problems, he (Modi) is trying to divert people’s attention to an issue which is far from reality,” Mr Sarkar added. - PTI Printable version | Jan 7, 2017 1:08:39 AM | http://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kolkata/Manik-Sarkar-flays-demonetisation/article16276974.ece © The Hindu First instance of assisted delivery in the Alipore Zoological Gardens"

The sudden announcement caught everyone off-guard: Even as the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) suspended toll collection, sales of vegetables and jewellery fell, cinemas saw a dip in footfall, and many daily wage labourers did not turn up for work. Despite government orders that petrol bunks accept 500 and 1,000 rupee notes, many petrol bunks asked customers to fill up fuel for either Rs. 500 or Rs. 1,000, as they could not provide them with change. However, a franchisee of Bharat Petroleum Corporation at West Tambaram in Chennai adopted a token system for repayment of cash. A receipt issued by the fuel station could be utilised for refuelling till November 16, a staff said. With the general public and retailers not possessing adequate lower denomination notes, vegetable sales at the Koyambedu wholesale market fell by as much as 50 per cent on Wednesday. With no clarity on accepting the 500 and 1,000 rupee notes, the market saw only 60 per cent of its usual footfall of about one lakh customers a day. Confusion prevailed in the wholesale and retail markets in Madurai, Thoothukudi and Kanniyakumari districts too as a majority of the traders were hesitant to accept the demonetised notes. Railway tickets At the Moore Market Complex, where several thousand railway tickets are booked everyday by people travelling to all corners of the country, passengers had to wait for a long time to get change in return for Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,000 notes. “I came at noon. My ticket in sleeper class on a waiting list to Gorakhpur from Chennai Central on Raptisagar has been booked. The fare is Rs. 800 and I gave a Rs. 1,000 note. I have been waiting for more than one hour to get the Rs. 200 balance,” said Sithar Singh. Railway staff said that since Wednesday morning, most people who had come to book tickets were giving only Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,000 notes. Notes of smaller denomination that they had with them at the time of opening the counter had been exhausted in less than an hour, and hence, they were finding it difficult to return the balance. As and when they got notes of smaller denomination, they returned them to the waiting passengers, the staff said. Meanwhile, daily wage labourers decided to skip work till the situation improved, mainly on account of fears of not being paid. Forty-year-old Babu, a daily wage labourer, and his co-workers from Kannagi Nagar and Ezhil Nagar in Chennai were unable to go for work as the employer couldn’t pay them their advance money. “Before work we are paid a sum (of money); but our employer had four Rs. 1,000 notes which nobody was ready to exchange. So, we decided to remain at home. Everything has come to a standstill,” said Babu. At Coimbatore too, the same situation prevailed. “It is the workers who are apprehensive. Since morning, they have not worked,” added M.V. Loganathan, president of Coimbatore SIDCO Industrial Estate Manufacturers’ Welfare Association. Kancheepuram witnessed a bandh-like situation with many silk-saree showrooms seeing very low turnout of customers despite Wednesday being a ‘muhurtham’ day. Some shops put up notice boards stating they would accept 500 and 1,000 rupees notes provided they customers bought goods for the entire amount. In Kanniyakumari, many tourists who did not carry adequate cash in hand were left in the lurch. However, some hotels in Nagercoil, despite putting up a board that Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,000 notes would not be accepted, took them on “humanitarian grounds” from tourists from far-off places like North India and Karnataka, according to a hotel owner.

53,2016-11-10,3.0,"A day after, chaos gains currency",": Confusion and hardship marked the first day after the Centre, in a surprise move, decided to demonetise Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,000 currency notes.

54,2016-11-10,3.0,Normal life thrown out of gear after currency note withdrawal,"The voiding of two common denominations of currency since midnight on Tuesday threw normal life out of gear in the city as several shops and restaurants downed shutters. Ever since the announcement about the Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,000 notes ceasing to be legal tender was made public, long queues had formed outside ATMs on Tuesday night as people tried to withdraw Rs. 100 denomination currency or make a deposit on CDR machines. Though petrol/diesel outlets, apart from government hospitals and milk booths, were allowed to accept the soon-to-be-obsolete currency, several fuelling stations shut shop as they ran out of change. Jewellery shops were open but business was well under par. Major retailers displayed boards stating that Rs. 1000 and Rs. 500 notes would not be accepted. “Gold is normally the safest choice of consumers to safeguard their small savings, but the demonetisation decision which came at about the time shops were closing neutralised that option,” said N. Naveen Baalaji, managing partner of Sri Lakshmi Jewellery. “Shopping sentiment has soured and we expect it to remain so for the next few days as people are looking to stay afloat,” he said. While most shopping outlets deemed it prudent to simply down shutters, in the ones that stayed open, transactions were confined to credit/debit cards. Goubert Market on Nehru Street was a pale shadow of its usual bustling self as only small change was accepted by the vendors. The demonetisation also caught tourists, especially foreigners, completely unawares. Martin and his spouse from Australia were among the scores of tourists taken unawares by the demonetisation. “We didn’t realise we were holding invalidated currency until we stepped out of our hotel rooms in the morning to buy some stuff from a superstore,” Mr. Martin said. The visitors who are staying at the Ashram were told that the store would not accept the Rs. 500 note. “We were told that we could use notes only against purchases for about Rs. 450,” said Mr. Martin. On being informed of the demonetisation, they began to hunt for a bank to convert the currency only to learn that banks too were closed for the day. They have shelved their plans for shopping and hope to file up before a bank ahead of opening hour to convert currency on Thursday.

  A night after notes of two denominations, Rs 500 and Rs 1000, were rendered useless, regular city life got affected in the most unexpected way. For most part of Wednesday, there was sparse traffic on the city roads suggesting that there was less or no business conducted at every level. The usually bustling Abids, Banjara Hills, Madhapur, Begumpet, Secunderabad and old city wore a dull look with many shops either partially shut or displaying posters which read that the banned currency would not be accepted. Since many ATMs and Banks were closed, many uninformed persons landed at post offices to exchange out-of-use notes. Since the post offices were ordered to suspend transactions of all kinds for a day, those who had come to convert the demonetised notes to lower and legal denominations were also disappointed. “Many of our customers stood outside office as they wanted to buy stamps or covers by handing over Rs 500 or Rs 1000. More than 100 people have visited the office since morning with enquiries. We have been explaining to them that we are not authorised to accept the banned notes,” said a clerk at Jubilee Hills post office. Chaotic scenes were witnessed outside many petrol bunks across the city. If long queues of vehicles disrupted traffic outside fuel stations, then customers arguing with operators to accept the cash made further delayed the service. Most of the petrol bunk operators accepted fuel of only Rs 500 or Rs 1000 and refused to give out change citing shortage. At supermarkets and grocery stores, the credit and debit card machines came to the rescue as consumers extensively used their plastic money to make purchases. Grocers running without computerised billing accepted Rs. 500 notes but refused to part with change. ""Purchases can only be made for the entire amount being paid. We do not have change,"" said one grocer near Kandiguda in Sainikpuri. Multiplexes and malls too saw a drop in the number of visitors.

56,2016-11-10,3.0,When the notes didn?t gain any currency,"Chaos ruled wholesale markets in the city — from Yeshwantpur to old pete and vegetable markets — on Wednesday after demonetisation of Rs. 500, Rs. 1,000 notes. Shopping areas such as Commercial Street and Russell Market were deserted. In many markets, street hawkers and eatery owners looked tired of answering the question: “Do you have change for Rs. 500?” Though traders in old pete and Yeshwantpur APMC yard were wary of accepting Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,000 notes, they eventually accepted the demonetised currency notes so as to not to lose business. “If we refuse to accept these notes, we will have to shut down markets for many days. We will have to exchange these notes in banks from Thursday,” said Ravi Kumar, an onion merchant at the Yeshwantpur market. A merchant in Chickpet said they were accepting demonetised currency notes to prevent loss of business. Restaurants also saw poor business and some eatery owners turned away people who came with Rs. 500 notes. However, merchants and traders are stuck with these currency notes as farmers, suppliers and even transporters are refusing to accept payments in them. “We estimate it will take a month for the business to stabilise. None of us has money to pay farmers. Moreover, we are in a sector where all payments are made in cash. The limit of Rs. 20,000 a week limit is laughable,” said Ramesh Chandra Lahoti, president of Bangalore Foodgrains Merchants Association. worst hit For the roadside vendors, even a one day’s loss of sales could mean going to sleep on an empty stomach. Kamalamma (65), who sits outside Bangalore Fort, was almost in tears as she looked at her wilted greens. “I have not made even one sale the whole day,” she said. She has no family of her own and doesn’t have a bank account. Those selling non-essential items such as knick-knacks and combs were the worst hit, with people unwilling to shell out change for such items. “No one has change to buy my wigs; they have been made with hair from Tirupati,” said Vasantha, who sells wigs near the fort. *** Fewer transactions Gold sales lost their shine on Wednesday with many jewellery stores seeing a drop in customers. The confusion over cash transactions, coupled with a slight rise in the gold price, meant empty showrooms. At one such jewellery store in the central business district, the staff said they had made less than half their usual sales. “There have been dismal sales from morning; it has been less than 10 per cent of the usual sales, all through RTGS and card,” said Manakchand Badera, owner, Panchkesari Badera Jewellers, Jayanagar. *** Many traffic offenders let off Even traffic policemen were not spared of the effect of the ban on Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,000 notes. It was a lucky day for some traffic offenders as policemen had to let them off just because they did not have the change. “If they give us Rs. 500 for a fine of Rs. 100, where do we get the change from? So, we have just been letting off people,” said a helplessl traffic policeman. Those who were handed over notes of Rs. 1,000 or Rs. 500 were seen scrutinising them carefully. *** BTC to take a call on races today Bangalore Turf Club (BTC) will take a call on Thursday on whether or not to hold races this weekend. A committee will meet on Thursday to take stock of the situation in the light of demonetisation of high-value currency notes. “Our races are scheduled for Friday and Saturday. The cities that had races scheduled for Wednesday cancelled them,” said a senior BTC member. Most of the transactions at BTC are done in cash only. *** Card clubs shift to keeping accounts Clubs hosting card games such as rummy had to adapt to demonetisation of high-value currency notes that usually made most of the cash on the table. Clubs resorted to keeping accounts of the dues by members buying the chips for the game, abjuring all cash transactions. *** Chaos at tourism destinations Ticket counters at tourism spots in the city such as Lalbagh, Tipu Sultan Palace and Bannerghatta National Park, were also affected as authorities could not provide change to many tourists tendering Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,000 notes. *** Bus conductors accept notes, run out of change On a day when most government offices were not accepting Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,000 notes, conductors of BMTC and KSRTC buses accepted the notes and issued tickets. However, with several passengers opting to buy daily pass and paying with Rs. 500 notes, conductors ran out of change and had to start refusing tickets in several routes. Namma Metro users who tendered Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,000 notes to recharge their smart cards for higher amounts were turned away. Cab aggregators such as Uber and Ola sent out alerts to users that they would not be accepting Rs. 500 and Rs 1,000 notes. Online payments were encouraged. For autorickshaw users, it was a tough day as drivers, tired of handing out change, took to asking customers to board only if they could pay exact change. *** Hawala operators were in high demand Hawala operators, many of whom operate from the congested pete areas of the city, have allegedly collected large sums of money since Tuesday night from those hoarding black money. They were in high demand on Tuesday night after the Prime Minister’s announcement on demonetising Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,000 notes, and operated till past midnight, sources in the police said, and added that such people shut their operations by Wednesday morning after panicking. Most of those who went to these operators were traders with unaccounted for cash, sources said. The going rate was a commission of 30 per cent for conversion — that is, the seller got Rs. 350 for every Rs. 500 note and Rs. 700 for every Rs. 1,000 note. In some cases, hawala operators started charging even 40 per cent cuts and promised to pay in new currency only after two months. However, sources said the operators decided that it was too risky and decided to wait and watch. A senior official in the Economic Offences Wing of the State police said they were closely watching all transactions for any criminal offences during this period. Bengaluru city police and tax agencies are working in tandem to track down on high-value currency transportation across the State too. Police officials said the move to demonetise high-value currency had hit hard those indulging in gambling, and many operators had closed shop for now. “All gambling is in black money and they need time to build up black cash reserves in new currency to float again. These operators are likely to be down for at least three months,” an official said. Overnight, currency exchange turns into booming business By Wednesday morning, the currency exchange bazaar had turned unorganised, and even street vendors had turned into currency exchange dealers across the city. Several such “agents” were trading in Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,000 notes by roadsides and shops. For instance, a tender coconut vendor offered to accept a Rs. 500 note for a cut of Rs. 200 in east Bengaluru. However, he refused to say where he would exchange the demonetised notes later. In Chickpet, one of the oldest markets of the city, shopkeepers were seen openly trading in currency notes, with even competitive cuts. However, these were restricted to small sums of money and they made spot payments, unlike hawala operators. *** Generous’ gifts at weddings Guests at weddings in Hassan in Karnataka saw it as an opportunity to clear the Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,000 notes. They “generously” gave away these notes as gifts! This was what The Hindu saw on visiting a couple of marriage halls in Hassan on Wednesday. “Whatever I have collected so far are only Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,000 notes. Most people do not want to part with the few Rs. 100 notes they have,” said a woman who was collecting gifts on behalf of the bride at Seetha Ramanjaneya Choultry in the town. Anushree and Raghavendra, from villages near Dudda, got married here. Similar scenes were witnessed at other halls too. Meanwhile, the parents of the bride and the groom were a harried lot. They had taken out cash to handle the last-minute expenses on the wedding day and were left with only Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,000 notes. “I have to postpone all payments for the day,” said Manjunath, whose sister got married in Sakleshpur on Wednesday. *** Drop in transactions at govt. offices Many residents of Bengaluru had a tough time on Wednesday with several government offices stopping accepting Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,000 notes, leading to a drastic drop in transactions, and hassles for all. BangaloreOne centres across the city were accepting payments only by card, cheque or demand drafts. Cash payments by notes of any denomination were stopped. At offices of Bangalore Water Supply and Sewerage Board, all transactions were halted for Wednesday. Electricity bill payments were also being accepted in Rs. 100 notes or other instruments only. Property transactions dropped to less than one thirds across the State on Wednesday, with over half the sub-registrar’s offices registering no property transaction at all. RTO offices also registered a drop in transactions because they were not accepting the Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,000 notes. *** Arguments at toll booths Toll roads across the city witnessed heavy rush as travellers tried to use their Rs. 500 notes at the booths, leading to arguments with the staff manning the booths. While these notes were not accepted earlier, a statement from the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) eventually led to toll booth operators accepting the demonetised currency. However, a lack of enough smaller denomination notes led to toll booth officials refusing larger denomination notes as they could not return exact change. The issue was mitigated only after an announcement by Union Transport Minister Nitin Gadkari that toll collection had been waived at NHAI toll booths across the country till midnight of November 11.

58,2016-11-10,3.0,?Demonetisation will hit terror financing hard?,"The government has said one of the reasons to demonetise notes of Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,000 was to curb the circulation of fake currency, but there seems to be no definite account of the amount of such notes in circulation. As per a study done by the Indian Statistical Institute, Kolkata, in 2015, the only concrete work done on the subject, at any given point of time Rs. 400 crore worth fake notes were in circulation in the economy. This is merely 0.025 per cent of the total budget outlay of Rs. 19.7 lakh crore as announced this fiscal. Different agencies have their own estimates based on the recoveries made by them. According to the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB), in 2015, various law enforcement agencies seized 1,78,022 pieces of fake Rs 1,000 notes. This means Rs 17 crore fake notes, which were in circulation could be calculated as they could be seized. Similarly, in 2015, as many as 2,99,524 pieces of Rs. 500 fake notes were seized. Spread of counterfeits The Indian Statistical Institute, Kolkata study, done on behalf of the National Investigation Agency (NIA), said that Rs. 70 crore fake notes were pumped into the economy every year. Officials in the security establishment were upbeat about the demonetisation scheme as they expect that crimes like terror financing would be severely hit by the move. Cases registered

 “The fake notes can be detected only when they enter the banking system. If it is in circulation in the open market, then it’s hard to calculate the number. In the past two years, we registered 25 cases of fake notes and 26 persons were convicted in three cases and the remaining cases are still on trial,” said Alok Mittal, Inspector General, NIA. Another official said that in 90 per cent of the cases, fake currency was pumped in through the land route from Bangladesh. “The fake notes are manufactured in Pakistan and they reach Bangladesh through air and sea route. An organised group then pushes the money into India through the porous border areas,” said the official. Security features

 On being asked how the yet to be launched Rs. 2,000 notes would be deterrent to the resurgence of the fake currency notes, an official said, “It is difficult to say and we can only assume that Pakistan or the elements involved in it would not be able to compromise the security features. It is true that certain security features of Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,000 notes had been compromised. The supplier of raw currency, the ink and the silver thread is same for India and Pakistan and we have been asking countries like the U.K, the U.S. and Germany, where these are manufactured to stop the sale to Pakistan.” D.C Pathak, former Intelligence Bureau chief, said, “While removing black money, the process it [demonetisation] will definitely address the problem areas of terror financing and fake currency. There is illegal money behind terrorist funding. The channel through which the adversary sends in militants and arms is also used to send fake currency.” An official said the demonetisation would impact the terror financing, particularly in Jammu and Kashmir. Terrorist outfits like Hizb-ul-Mujahideen collect donations in Pakistan and then route the money into the State through hawala operators. “The terror funding module in place right now, will be affected as the terrorist operatives always store money in the form of big currency notes. That money has become a piece of paper now,” said the official. Jayadeva Ranade, distinguished fellow, Centre for Air Power Studies said, “It will be a blow to the main sponsors of fake currency, Pakistan and Wahabi groups. I don’t expect them to stop but it will take some time. It is a good move, hits them on many prongs. Many of their operators and sleeper cells here have fake currency. It will be a severe blow and for a few years we will get relief from this.” Printable version | Jan 7, 2017 1:08:55 AM | http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/%E2%80%98Demonetisation-will-hit-terror-financing-hard%E2%80%99/article16441834.ece © The Hindu Be it nature’s fury or man’s folly, destructions are alike.

It is true that certain security features of Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,000 notes had been compromised. The supplier of raw currency notes, the ink and the silver thread is same for India and Pakistan and we have been asking the the countries like the U.K, the U.S. and Germany, where these are manufactured to stop the sale to Pakistan.” D.C Pathak, former IB chief said, “While removing black money, in the process it [demonetisation] will definitely address the problem areas of terror financing and fake currency. There is illegal money behind terrorist funding. The channel through which the adversary sends in militants and arms is also used to send fake currency.” An official said the demonetisation would impact the terror financing, particularly in Jammu and Kashmir. He said terrorist outfits like Hizbul Mujahideen collect donations in Pakistan and then route the money into the State through hawala operators. “The terror funding module in place right now, will be affected as the terrorist operatives always store money in the form of big currency notes. That money has become a piece of paper now,” said the official. Jayadeva Ranade, distinguished fellow, Centre for Air Power Studies said, “t will be a blow to the main sponsors of fake currency, Pakistan and Wahabi groups. I don’t expect them to stop but it will take some time. It is a good move, hits them on many prongs. Many of their operators and sleeper cells here have fake currency. It will be a severe blow and for a few years we will get relief from this.” Printable version | Jan 7, 2017 1:08:59 AM | http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/%E2%80%98Demonetisation-to-hit-terror-financing-hard%E2%80%99/article16275304.ece © The Hindu Be it nature’s fury or man’s folly, destructions are alike.

A key Chinese leader, Meng Jianzhu, who was on a day-long visit here, on Wednesday held talks with Home Minister Rajnath Singh. Mr. Singh asked Beijing to clamp down on Pakistan’s nefarious designs to smuggle fake Indian currency into India through China while referring to the recent arrest of a Pakistani national in Guangzhou with fake Indian currency. Mr. Jianzhu, Secretary of the Central Political and Legal Affairs Commission of the Communist Party of China also met Prime Minister Narendra Modi. “Raising India’s concerns on terrorism, the Home Minister appealed the Chinese leader to support the international community’s efforts to designate as a dreaded terrorist the leader of the Jaish-e-Mohammed, a terrorist group already designated under the U.N. Resolution 1267. Underlining that Pakistan was patronising and financing terrorist groups, Mr. Singh said that leaders of terrorist groups including JeM leader Masood Azhar, Lashkar-eTaiba leader Hafiz Saeed and Hizbul Mujahideen leader Salahuddin roam freely in Pakistan and preach terrorism,” a Home Ministry statement said. “Even the Tehreek-e-Taliban and Lashkar-e-Jhangvi, blamed for terrorist attacks inside Pakistan, were financed by the ISI, he said. Pointing out that there can be no good or bad terrorist, the Home Minister said terrorism is not one or another country’s problem, rather it is a threat to global peace and security. Mr. Singh also sought Beijing’s support to flush out ULFA leader Paresh Barua, who is believed to be taking refuge in the trijunction between India, Myanmar and China, to face trial in India for heinous crimes including murders. He also asked China to clamp down on arms smuggling to insurgent groups operating in India’s North-East.

On both the occasions, as is being pointed out now, the elimination of black money was cited as one of the major reasons. On January 13, 1946, THE HINDU carried a news story on the move, captioned as “War on black markets.” The difference between the previous instances and the present was only in the manner in which the announcements were made.

63,2016-11-10,3.0,Rajnath Singh justifies ?historic? demonetisation in Ballia,": Hailing it as a “surgical strike” on black money, Union Home Minister Rajnath Singh on Wednesday said that through his “historical” decision to demonetise Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,000 notes, Prime Minister Narendra Modi had dealt a big blow to terrorism. The home minister claimed that Mr. Modi has “taken away the strength” of terrorists and Pakistan, which he alleged had supplied fake currency notes to foster terrorism in India. “Fake currency was being printed in Pakistan and was then sent to India to destroy its economy. Such were Pakistan’s attempts...In India, fake currency was helping terrorists...it gives big strength to terrorists and Pakistan. By scrapping Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,000 notes, Narendra Modiji has taken away that strength,” Mr. Singh said. Addressing a ‘Parivartan Rally’ in Ballia on the eastern fringes of U.P., the minister also spoke about the U.S. presidential results, linking president-elect Donald Trump to Mr. Modi. “How did Mr.Trump fight his election? Mr. Trump said that if he became president of the U.S., he would follow and work according to Narendra Modi’s policies. That Trump has won in America, brothers and sisters,” Mr. Singh said, adding that after the Modi government came to power at the Centre, India had increased its global standing and become the fastest growing economy in the world. To introduce Mr. Trump to the eastern U.P. crowd, Mr. Singh had to resort to some familiarising: “On one side was Ms. Clinton and the other, Mr. Trump, the trump card...not the trump card in the game of cards...Mr. Trump.” At the rally attended by senior Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leaders and ministers, including Kalraj Mishra, Manoj Singh, Om Mathur, and Yogi Adityanath, the party made efforts to justify Mr. Modi’s decision to demonetise currency in the wake of the disruption of normal life and services. Mr. Singh said the decision had paved the way for making India a “global economic superpower”, even as he appealed to the people to bear the temporary inconvenience due to the shift in currency as it would push India towards becoming a global economic superpower. “I am sure it must be causing inconvenience to some people for some time. But I want to assure you on the basis of what I know of economics, the step may cause inconvenience for a short period to some people but nobody can stop India from becoming the most powerful global economic force...it is such an important step,” Mr. Singh said in a speech in Hindi laced with the regional Bhojpuri. BJP State president Keshav Prasad Maurya termed it “bitter medicine” necessary to remove the “illness” of corruption “from its roots”. The former U.P. chief minister also raked up the surgical strikes by the army, saying it had sent a strong message nationally and internationally. “We can kill here and even there [across the Line of Control], if needed. We have shown it,” he said. The minister also asked the crowd to raise their hands in the air to laud the army’s efforts, even as he recalled the role of Ballia, one of U.P.’s most backward districts, in the Independence movement. He also promised to abolish interviews while recruiting police personnel, saying this would end corruption in the process. Urging voters to elect a BJP government in UP, Mr. Singh said that under his party’s rule, no goon would be allowed to walk free in the State. While the Bahujan Samajwadi Party (BSP) has maintained a studied silence on the demonetisation issue so far, the BJP is out to project that it will hamper the BSP’s prospects in the 2017 elections. “Will Mayawati get sleep after it? Will corrupt officials get sleep?” Mr. Maurya asked.

For the upcoming Sunburn event to be held on November 12, Saturday, where international artistes will take the stage, a ticketing volunteer grabbed attention with his message which went viral on WhatsApp. “It was a marketing strategy to reach out to the people,” said the volunteer and a member of the event management crew who did not wish to be quoted. “There was panic among youngsters on how they can pay for the passes. We wanted to convey that we are accepting cash including Rs. 500 and Rs. 1000 notes to clear the confusion. After we sent out the message, we did get enquiries from those who wanted to buy tickets offline by paying cash.” A gym in Jubilee Hills too sent a similar message to its members.

Residents of the city were having a tough time transacting business or even paying for essentials on the first day of the demonetisation of Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,000 notes.

| Photo Credit: V Sreenivasa Murthy Chaos ruled wholesale markets in the city — from Yeshwantpur to old pete and vegetable markets — on Wednesday after demonetisation of Rs. 500, Rs. 1,000 notes. Shopping areas such as Commercial Street and Russell Market were deserted. In many markets, street hawkers and eatery owners looked tired of answering the question: “Do you have change for Rs. 500?” Though traders in old pete and Yeshwantpur APMC yard were wary of accepting Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,000 notes, they eventually accepted the demonetised currency notes so as to not to lose business. “If we refuse to accept these notes, we will have to shut down markets for many days. We will have to exchange these notes in banks from Thursday,” said Ravi Kumar, an onion merchant at the Yeshwantpur market. A merchant in Chickpet said they were accepting demonetised currency notes to prevent loss of business. Restaurants also saw poor business and some eatery owners turned away people who came with Rs. 500 notes. However, merchants and traders are stuck with these currency notes as farmers, suppliers and even transporters are refusing to accept payments in them. “We estimate it will take a month for the business to stabilise. None of us has money to pay farmers. Moreover, we are in a sector where all payments are made in cash. The limit of Rs. 20,000 a week limit is laughable,” said Ramesh Chandra Lahoti, president of Bangalore Foodgrains Merchants Association. worst hit For the roadside vendors, even a one day’s loss of sales could mean going to sleep on an empty stomach. Kamalamma (65), who sits outside Bangalore Fort, was almost in tears as she looked at her wilted greens. “I have not made even one sale the whole day,” she said. She has no family of her own and doesn’t have a bank account. Those selling non-essential items such as knick-knacks and combs were the worst hit, with people unwilling to shell out change for such items. “No one has change to buy my wigs; they have been made with hair from Tirupati,” said Vasantha, who sells wigs near the fort. *** Fewer transactions Gold sales lost their shine on Wednesday with many jewellery stores seeing a drop in customers. The confusion over cash transactions, coupled with a slight rise in the gold price, meant empty showrooms. At one such jewellery store in the central business district, the staff said they had made less than half their usual sales. “There have been dismal sales from morning; it has been less than 10 per cent of the usual sales, all through RTGS and card,” said Manakchand Badera, owner, Panchkesari Badera Jewellers, Jayanagar. *** Many traffic offenders let off Even traffic policemen were not spared of the effect of the ban on Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,000 notes. It was a lucky day for some traffic offenders as policemen had to let them off just because they did not have the change. “If they give us Rs. 500 for a fine of Rs. 100, where do we get the change from? So, we have just been letting off people,” said a helplessl traffic policeman. Those who were handed over notes of Rs. 1,000 or Rs. 500 were seen scrutinising them carefully. *** BTC to take a call on races today Bangalore Turf Club (BTC) will take a call on Thursday on whether or not to hold races this weekend. A committee will meet on Thursday to take stock of the situation in the light of demonetisation of high-value currency notes. “Our races are scheduled for Friday and Saturday. The cities that had races scheduled for Wednesday cancelled them,” said a senior BTC member. Most of the transactions at BTC are done in cash only. *** Card clubs shift to keeping accounts Clubs hosting card games such as rummy had to adapt to demonetisation of high-value currency notes that usually made most of the cash on the table. Clubs resorted to keeping accounts of the dues by members buying the chips for the game, abjuring all cash transactions. *** Chaos at tourism destinations Ticket counters at tourism spots in the city such as Lalbagh, Tipu Sultan Palace and Bannerghatta National Park, were also affected as authorities could not provide change to many tourists tendering Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,000 notes. *** Bus conductors accept notes, run out of change On a day when most government offices were not accepting Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,000 notes, conductors of BMTC and KSRTC buses accepted the notes and issued tickets. However, with several passengers opting to buy daily pass and paying with Rs. 500 notes, conductors ran out of change and had to start refusing tickets in several routes. Namma Metro users who tendered Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,000 notes to recharge their smart cards for higher amounts were turned away. Cab aggregators such as Uber and Ola sent out alerts to users that they would not be accepting Rs. 500 and Rs 1,000 notes. Online payments were encouraged. For autorickshaw users, it was a tough day as drivers, tired of handing out change, took to asking customers to board only if they could pay exact change. *** Hawala operators were in high demand Hawala operators, many of whom operate from the congested pete areas of the city, have allegedly collected large sums of money since Tuesday night from those hoarding black money. They were in high demand on Tuesday night after the Prime Minister’s announcement on demonetising Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,000 notes, and operated till past midnight, sources in the police said, and added that such people shut their operations by Wednesday morning after panicking. Most of those who went to these operators were traders with unaccounted for cash, sources said. The going rate was a commission of 30 per cent for conversion — that is, the seller got Rs. 350 for every Rs. 500 note and Rs. 700 for every Rs. 1,000 note. In some cases, hawala operators started charging even 40 per cent cuts and promised to pay in new currency only after two months. However, sources said the operators decided that it was too risky and decided to wait and watch. A senior official in the Economic Offences Wing of the State police said they were closely watching all transactions for any criminal offences during this period. Bengaluru city police and tax agencies are working in tandem to track down on high-value currency transportation across the State too. Police officials said the move to demonetise high-value currency had hit hard those indulging in gambling, and many operators had closed shop for now. “All gambling is in black money and they need time to build up black cash reserves in new currency to float again. These operators are likely to be down for at least three months,” an official said. Overnight, currency exchange turns into booming business By Wednesday morning, the currency exchange bazaar had turned unorganised, and even street vendors had turned into currency exchange dealers across the city. Several such “agents” were trading in Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,000 notes by roadsides and shops. For instance, a tender coconut vendor offered to accept a Rs. 500 note for a cut of Rs. 200 in east Bengaluru. However, he refused to say where he would exchange the demonetised notes later. In Chickpet, one of the oldest markets of the city, shopkeepers were seen openly trading in currency notes, with even competitive cuts. However, these were restricted to small sums of money and they made spot payments, unlike hawala operators. *** Generous’ gifts at weddings Guests at weddings in Hassan in Karnataka saw it as an opportunity to clear the Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,000 notes. They “generously” gave away these notes as gifts! This was what The Hindu saw on visiting a couple of marriage halls in Hassan on Wednesday. “Whatever I have collected so far are only Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,000 notes. Most people do not want to part with the few Rs. 100 notes they have,” said a woman who was collecting gifts on behalf of the bride at Seetha Ramanjaneya Choultry in the town. Anushree and Raghavendra, from villages near Dudda, got married here. Similar scenes were witnessed at other halls too. Meanwhile, the parents of the bride and the groom were a harried lot. They had taken out cash to handle the last-minute expenses on the wedding day and were left with only Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,000 notes. “I have to postpone all payments for the day,” said Manjunath, whose sister got married in Sakleshpur on Wednesday. *** Drop in transactions at govt. offices Many residents of Bengaluru had a tough time on Wednesday with several government offices stopping accepting Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,000 notes, leading to a drastic drop in transactions, and hassles for all. BangaloreOne centres across the city were accepting payments only by card, cheque or demand drafts. Cash payments by notes of any denomination were stopped. At offices of Bangalore Water Supply and Sewerage Board, all transactions were halted for Wednesday. Electricity bill payments were also being accepted in Rs. 100 notes or other instruments only. Property transactions dropped to less than one thirds across the State on Wednesday, with over half the sub-registrar’s offices registering no property transaction at all. RTO offices also registered a drop in transactions because they were not accepting the Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,000 notes. *** Arguments at toll booths Toll roads across the city witnessed heavy rush as travellers tried to use their Rs. 500 notes at the booths, leading to arguments with the staff manning the booths. While these notes were not accepted earlier, a statement from the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) eventually led to toll booth operators accepting the demonetised currency. However, a lack of enough smaller denomination notes led to toll booth officials refusing larger denomination notes as they could not return exact change. The issue was mitigated only after an announcement by Union Transport Minister Nitin Gadkari that toll collection had been waived at NHAI toll booths across the country till midnight of November 11.

68,2016-11-10,3.0,Confusion rules day oneof demonetisation,"MADURAI: Apart from triggering discussions in the streets over its pros and cons, the union government’s decision to demonetise Rs. 500 and Rs. 1000 denominations from Tuesday night resulted in chaos and panic among wider sections of public here on Wednesday. Majority of the business establishments reported dull business. An employee from a hotel in K.K. Nagar said that some of the bookings made were cancelled as people preferred to postpone their travel plans fearing non-availability of cash. “Tourists, particularly from foreign countries, staying in the hotel panicked as they did not have cash to eat,” he added. Another person running a small hotel, said that his employees demanded their daily salary be paid in Rs. 100 denomination currencies. “They asked to pay at least Rs. 100 and the remaining later so that they can meet their daily expenses,” he said. N. Ramesh, working with a private bus operator at Mattuthavani bus stand, said that the bookings made at the counters were significantly low compared to a normal day. Fuel stations were the only place that witnessed huge crowd with majority of the people filling fuel to get change for higher denomination currencies. A group of BJP cadres burst crackers and distributed sweets in front of District Collectorate and raised slogans praising Prime Minister Narendra Modi for the decision. L. Murari, President of Madurai District Tiny and Small Scale Industries Association (MADITSSIA), welcomed the move while acknowledging that it would be a hassle for the public and small scale traders for the initial few days. Major jewellery shops, a few textiles shops and several trade houses in the city remained closed on Tuesday in order to avoid cash transactions. However, smaller textile shops, jewellers and traders carried on business, accepting the abolished currency notes from the customers. Other trades were not affected. Small shopkeepers in rural areas offered credit liberally to regular buyers and asked them to settle the bill after two days. Many vegetable vendors struggled to buy vegetable in the morning as many commission agents neither accepted the demonetised notes nor offered credit. The worst-affected were two and three-wheeler riders as employees of several petrol bunks faced shortage of Rs. 100 currency notes.

The officials said that the nearly Rs. 37 crore worth of counterfeit currency they have recovered over the past five years is just the tip of the iceberg. A senior police officer, who has been a part of both the units dealing with FICN -- Special Cell and Crime Branch, said that the move will also choke terror funding as the money is pumped from Pakistan through various routes in fake currency of denominations, primarily of Rs.500 and Rs.1,000. While 55,785 notes of Rs. 1,000 were seized in 2012, the corresponding number for Rs. 500 notes was 1,26,822. Surprisingly, denominations as low as Rs. 5 are also printed. As recently as last year, 11,000 counterfeit five rupee notes were recovered by the police. The officer said that the now repealed Prevention of Terrorism Act, 2002 (POTA) had stricter punishment for funding terror, but while that applied to individuals, the latest move has meant that the jugular vein has been cut. Also, the cases unearthed so far have pointed to mass-scale printing of notes across the border with millions invested in printing costs. He said that the sleeper cells also store cash in the same denominations and with one stroke, all those notes were made redundant.

  Though a few jewellers traded till late on Tuesday night, many said that sales remained dull in Mangaluru on Wednesday, after Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,000 notes became invalid tender on Tuesday night. There was a steady steam of visitors at a few jewellery units on M.G. Road and Balmatta Road that operated till around midnight on Tuesday. There were also visitors to jewellery units on Wednesday. A marketing executive of Malabar Gold outlet on Falnir Road said that they are only accepting payments by debit cards, cheque and Rs. 100 notes. “It is our policy. We are politely sending away people coming with Rs. 500 and Rs. 1000 notes,” the executive said. Joyalukkas adopted a similar policy. “We are clearly telling our customers that we are not dealing with Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,000 notes,” an executive of Joyalukkas unit on Falnir Road said. He said that not many customers came to the store. A senior Customs official said that the many visits by people on Tuesday night and Wednesday to jewellery units might be because of the announcement by the Centre. The official said that gold purchases in these units had had to be legal and ruled out hoarding of Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,000 notes by the jewellery stores.

71,2016-11-10,3.0,Rajnath Singh justifies ?historic? demonetisation in Ballia,": Hailing it as a “surgical strike” on black money, Union Home Minister Rajnath Singh on Wednesday said that through his “historical” decision to demonetise Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,000 notes, Prime Minister Narendra Modi had dealt a big blow to terrorism. The home minister claimed that Mr. Modi has “taken away the strength” of terrorists and Pakistan, which he alleged had supplied fake currency notes to foster terrorism in India. “Fake currency was being printed in Pakistan and was then sent to India to destroy its economy. Such were Pakistan’s attempts...In India, fake currency was helping terrorists...it gives big strength to terrorists and Pakistan. By scrapping Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,000 notes, Narendra Modiji has taken away that strength,” Mr. Singh said. Addressing a ‘Parivartan Rally’ in Ballia on the eastern fringes of U.P., the minister also spoke about the U.S. presidential results, linking president-elect Donald Trump to Mr. Modi. “How did Mr.Trump fight his election? Mr. Trump said that if he became president of the U.S., he would follow and work according to Narendra Modi’s policies. That Trump has won in America, brothers and sisters,” Mr. Singh said, adding that after the Modi government came to power at the Centre, India had increased its global standing and become the fastest growing economy in the world. To introduce Mr. Trump to the eastern U.P. crowd, Mr. Singh had to resort to some familiarising: “On one side was Ms. Clinton and the other, Mr. Trump, the trump card...not the trump card in the game of cards...Mr. Trump.” At the rally attended by senior Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leaders and ministers, including Kalraj Mishra, Manoj Singh, Om Mathur, and Yogi Adityanath, the party made efforts to justify Mr. Modi’s decision to demonetise currency in the wake of the disruption of normal life and services. Mr. Singh said the decision had paved the way for making India a “global economic superpower”, even as he appealed to the people to bear the temporary inconvenience due to the shift in currency as it would push India towards becoming a global economic superpower. “I am sure it must be causing inconvenience to some people for some time. But I want to assure you on the basis of what I know of economics, the step may cause inconvenience for a short period to some people but nobody can stop India from becoming the most powerful global economic force...it is such an important step,” Mr. Singh said in a speech in Hindi laced with the regional Bhojpuri. BJP State president Keshav Prasad Maurya termed it “bitter medicine” necessary to remove the “illness” of corruption “from its roots”. The former U.P. chief minister also raked up the surgical strikes by the army, saying it had sent a strong message nationally and internationally. “We can kill here and even there [across the Line of Control], if needed. We have shown it,” he said. The minister also asked the crowd to raise their hands in the air to laud the army’s efforts, even as he recalled the role of Ballia, one of U.P.’s most backward districts, in the Independence movement. He also promised to abolish interviews while recruiting police personnel, saying this would end corruption in the process. Urging voters to elect a BJP government in UP, Mr. Singh said that under his party’s rule, no goon would be allowed to walk free in the State. While the Bahujan Samajwadi Party (BSP) has maintained a studied silence on the demonetisation issue so far, the BJP is out to project that it will hamper the BSP’s prospects in the 2017 elections. “Will Mayawati get sleep after it? Will corrupt officials get sleep?” Mr. Maurya asked.

  As expected, the sudden announcement on demonetisation caused initial hiccups and a chaotic situation prevailed in the city on Wednesday. While ATMs downed their shutters in tune with the government order, there were huge crowds at all places that witness large scale cash transactions such as toll gates, railway station, central bus station and fuel stations. While petrol bunks accepted ₹ 500 and ₹1,000 notes, though after initial resistance, they could not generate enough change to return. As a result, they insisted on filling up tanks for the entire denomination, which resulted in friction at half a dozen locations.Pilgrims visiting the temple city from far-off places also woke up to the news and had to face hardship. “We welcome the decision, but it should have been planned and announced after careful thought so as to avoid such inconvenience to the pilgrims and the middle class population,” said social activist P. Naveenkumar Reddy, who staged a demonstration at the Rajiv Gandhi Circle by displaying the demonetised notes.

A few businesses in three of city’s largest markets including Abids, Secunderbad and Begumpet-Panjagutta that worked through the night are believed to have catered to sudden surge in footfalls and met a demand many times average daily sales. It was also learnt that the deadline of midnight when the notes lost their monetary worth, was circumvented by tinkering with billing. “The market witnessed sales many times what is seen on Dhanteras or Akshaya Tritya. It was a mad rush and many shops remained opened through the night at the request of customers,” informed a trader who did not wish to be identified. Another trader hinted that the software used in billing systems can be tinkered to reflect a desired time or date. However at big-brand stores in Panjugutta, traders simply did not bother with bills. Customers were free to buy gold without considering jewellery design and pay using demonetised currency. “We did receive reports of some jewellers working past midnight but most of the market in Hyderabad had closed after the announcement was made. We think the announcement augers well for the business as it brings in greater transparency,” said Gopi Kishan, a trader affiliated with the Secunderabad Gold Silver Diamond Jewellers Association. He added that markets on Wednesday also witnessed heavy footfalls but most transactions were done through electronic money.

The Rs. 500 note was paid to him by his employer towards wages at Jainoor mandal headquarters in Kumram Bheem Asifabad district. “I am lucky to get Rs. 450. Others are getting only Rs. 400,” he said, revealing the undesirable economic dynamics which were set in motion on Wednesday in the rural areas of Adilabad and other districts. “The Transco revenue wing is not accepting the Rs. 500 bill. So many of us have been turned away for not being able to produce Rs. 100 or lower denomination for paying our electricity bill,” said Thumre Manik Rao of Bhuktapur locality in Adilabad town. Vattamwar Narsaiah, a grocer and former president of Adilabad Kirana Merchants Association, said business was at its slackest, as people had no money to purchase provisions. “This is the time every month when the middle and lower middle class stock food grains,” he said.

The Centre’s move to control black money has also stirred a hornet’s nest as those who had stashed away huge sums are trying to find ways to legalise the currency. “Usually, the currency hoarders will be on the lookout for small income tax returnees so that at least some quantum of black money can be converted into white through their accounts,” said a CA, who did not want to be identified.

75,2016-11-10,3.0,"U.S. poll result, demonetisation hit stocks","Share volumes in India may see a dip in the near future, especially from the retailinvestors. —FILE PHOTO
  The Indian stock market fell about 1,700 points during the morning session on Wednesday, mirroring a global trend, before staging a recovery on the back of banking and pharmaceutical stocks. Stock markets around the world saw sharp declines from fear of trade barriers that could arise if U.S. President-elect Donald Trump keeps his campaign promises. Indian indices too fell in sync, catalysed by the demonetisation of Rs.500 and Rs.1,000 notes, before recovering by the end of Wednesday. The victory of Donald Trump in the U.S. presidential polls led to a global sell off on concerns of possible trade barriers. The demonetisation of Rs.500 and Rs.1,000 notes in India also acted as a catalyst. The benchmark Sensex lost 1,688.69 points during the pre-open session to touch a low of 25,902.45. Later in the day, it recovered partially to close at 27,252.53, down 338.61 points or 1.23 per cent. The broader Nifty lost 111.55 points or 1.31 per cent to close at 8,432. Massive sell-off

During the early morning massive sell-off in the Indian market was part of global negative sentiment with the Dow Jones futures shedding more than 600 points and the leading Asian indices like Hang Seng and Nikkei losing 494 points and 920 points, respectively. “The U.S. presidential elections took the markets by surprise,” said Kamlesh Rao, chief executive officer, Kotak Securities. “The markets initially went into some tailspin as there have been previous concerns about possible trade barriers with other nations.” “Volumes may see a dip in the near future especially from the retail investors. However, the HNI (high net worth individual) and institutional volumes may not be impacted significantly. The volumes will pick up over medium term to long term,” added Mr. Rao. The technology sector bore the maximum brunt as Mr. Trump has already mentioned about his reservations on the H1-B visa programme under which Indian software engineers go to the U.S. TCS was the worst performer in the Sensex pack, shedding 4.93 per cent to close at Rs.2,171.05. Infosys also lost 2.74 per cent to close at Rs.955.85. Realty was another sector that lost ground owing to the government’s sudden crackdown on black money. The BSE Realty index lost 10.23 per cent while sector heavyweights like Indiabulls Real Estate, DLF, HDIL and Oberoi Realty all losing in the range of 10-20 per cent each. “The banning of large denomination currency may be a bit painful in the shorter term but definitely better for long-term in terms of better tax compliance, control on corruption as well as inflation,” said Motilal Oswal,chairman and managing director, Motilal Oswal Financial Services. A total of 2,157 stocks lost ground on BSE, with only 610 gainers. Banking stocks, however, managed to buck the trend with State Bank of India gaining 2.83 per cent while Kotak Mahindra Bank, Bank of Baroda and Punjab National Bank moving up over one per cent each. Rupee recovers

Despite a weak opening, the rupee ended stronger as compared to the dollar as the central bank intervened in the currency market. The rupee ended the day at 66.44 against the dollar as compared to its previous close of 66.42 per dollar. The rupee opened at 66.79 per dollar and went on to touch 66.93 before recovering. “State-run banks were selling dollars on behalf of the central bank. The recovery of the stock market also helped the currency,” said a currency dealer. Bonds also gained as demonetisation of currency is expected to cool inflationary pressures. The yield on the 10 year benchmark government bond ended 13 bps lower than its previous close, at 6.67 per cent.

  The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has directed banks to limit cash exchange for banned notes to Rs.4,000 from Wednesday until November 24, and told lenders to remain open on Saturday and Sunday. The cash exchange limit will be increased after November 24, according to the central bank. While banks will open Thursday, automated teller machines (ATM) will start functioning from Friday. According to bankers, RBI has already sent all the banks Rs. 2,000 denomination currency notes in large boxes on Wednesday and asked lenders to ration its distribution. The Rs.2000 currency notes will not be available in the automated teller machines (ATM) immediately as the machines need to be recalibrated, a move which may take at least two weeks, bankers said. As of now, only 100 and 50 denomination notes will be available. “RBI has instructed us to ensure everything goes smoothly so that the customer do not panic,” said the chief executive of a public sector bank. “They have asked us to open all the branches on Thursday.” While there will be limit on how much a customer can exchange, but there will no limit for depositing money in bank accounts. Any deposit of more than Rs.50,000 requires a PAN card. The RBI has also asked banks to remain open on Saturday (November 12) – which is a second Saturday of the month and Sunday (November 13).

People found it difficult to travel in buses and other modes of transport as they could not carry currency notes of small denominations to pay for the facility. Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,000 notes were not accepted at petrol pumps, shops, hotels, and toll gates. Scores of vehicles were stranded at toll plazas on National Highway-44 as users could not pay toll charges using the invalidated currency. Roadside eateries, vegetable and fruit vendors, hawkers, pushcart owners, tea sellers and even cinema theatres did not accept bigger notes. Consequently, markets appeared sluggish and financial transactions were badly affected. People seemed to be in utter confusion over the fate of the notes that were in their possession. Homemakers, who approached post offices to exchange their currency, were left disappointed.

There are similar examples from other countries as well. On demonetisation of higher denomination banknotes, the RBI said, “Rs.1,000 and Rs.10,000 banknotes, which were then in circulation were demonetised in January 1946. The higher denomination banknotes in Rs.1,000, Rs.5,000 and Rs.10,000 were reintroduced in the year 1954, and these banknotes were again demonetised in January 1978.” Zimbabwe is another example, which went through hyper-inflation in 2008 following which its currency lost value. In June 2015, the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe said the country had “adopted the multiple currency system or dollarisation in 2009 and it is therefore necessary to demonetise the Zimbabwe $ unit to replace it with the multiple currency system.” In Zimbabwe’s case, demonetisation was critical for policy consistency and for enhancing consumer and business confidence, its central bank had said. In Singapore, though Japanese “Banana” notes had been in circulation during the Japanese occupation, after the Japanese surrendered, the note was demonetised in 1945, the ‘Singapore Mint’ said.

Many vegetable vendors struggled to buy vegetable in the morning as many commission agents neither accepted the demonetised notes nor offered credit.

For most part of Wednesday, there was sparse traffic on the city roads suggesting that there was less or no business conducted at every level. The usually bustling Abids, Banjara Hills, Madhapur, Begumpet, Secunderabad and old city wore a dull look with many shops either partially shut or displaying posters which read that the banned currency would not be accepted. Since many ATMs and Banks were closed, many uninformed persons landed at post offices to exchange out-of-use notes. Since the post offices were ordered to suspend transactions of all kinds for a day, those who had come to convert the demonetised notes to lower and legal denominations were also disappointed. “Many of our customers stood outside office as they wanted to buy stamps or covers by handing over Rs 500 or Rs 1000. More than 100 people have visited the office since morning with enquiries. We have been explaining to them that we are not authorised to accept the banned notes,” said a clerk at Jubilee Hills post office. Chaotic scenes were witnessed outside many petrol bunks across the city. If long queues of vehicles disrupted traffic outside fuel stations, then customers arguing with operators to accept the cash made further delayed the service. Most of the petrol bunk operators accepted fuel of only Rs 500 or Rs 1000 and refused to give out change citing shortage. At supermarkets and grocery stores, the credit and debit card machines came to the rescue as consumers extensively used their plastic money to make purchases. Grocers running without computerised billing accepted Rs. 500 notes but refused to part with change. ""Purchases can only be made for the entire amount being paid. We do not have change,"" said one grocer near Kandiguda in Sainikpuri. Multiplexes and malls too saw a drop in the number of visitors.

84,2016-11-10,3.0,Pravasis stunned by demonetisation move,"“Stunned.” This is how many Kerala Pravasis described their initial reactions to the news of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s demonetisation announcement on Tuesday night. “As soon as the PM’s speech on the TV was over,” Jeby Thomas, a white-collar employee in a company in Dammam, Saudi Arabia, told The Hindu on the phone, “I called my wife in Pathanamthitta to put her in the crisis management mode.” This was typical of the response of a large number of Kerala Pravasis in the Gulf countries. Mr. Jeby pointed out that his family always kept around Rs.50,000 liquid cash at home to meet emergency situations. “I told my wife how to dispose of the notes in the next few days.” In the Gulf Cooperation Council countries — Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, UAE, Oman, Qatar and Bharain — Indian banks and money exchanges had stopped accepting the demonetised Indian notes on Tuesday night itself, sources said. In Oman, public sector banks like SBT and private money exchanges implemented the demonetisation immediately after Mr. Modi’s announcement. K.V. Shamsudeen, who has been working in the UAE for four decades and who is a volunteer financial adviser to the Kerala Pravasis, said most of the Keralite community in the UAE was startled by the demonetisation. He pointed out that Keralites usually kept a fair amount of Indian rupees with them so that they could use it while travelling to India. Now these “emergency funds” might turn out to be of no value. Mr. Shamsudeen pointed out that one UAE Malayali had on Wednesday sought his advice on how to cash the Rs.6 lakh he had kept with him. A small section of Gulf Pravasis, mostly the low-paid manual workers domestic helps, send their earnings home using the illegal Hawala money transfer channel. The hawala agents, who keep huge amounts of cash for distribution, will be in big trouble too.

  Across Kerala, like elsewhere in the country, the impact of the demonetisation of Rs. 500 and Rs.1,000 currency notes on the daily lives of people has been frustrating, annoying, and confusing, depending on which good or service they sought. At the Central railway station in the capital, there were many who arrived with Rs.1,000 notes to purchase platform tickets for Rs.5. “It came as an iruttadi (bolt from the blue) for me as I need to make a series of small and medium purchases for the wedding of my sister’s daughter next week,” a harried man, who cursed himself for withdrawing Rs.4 lakh in cash, all in 500s and 1000s, from a bank three days ago, told The Hindu in Kozhikode on Wednesday. Many rebuffed by shops “I came to know about the demonetisation only this morning as I had missed the TV news last night.” He still made it to S.M. Street here with a bundle of Rs.500 notes hoping to make some purchases, but was rebuffed by the shops. Welcoming the demonetisation step taken by the Centre, former UN financial expert and corporate finance consultant T.S. Anantharaman said in Thrissur that the move would help to check the flow of hawala money. Beneficial in the long run “Most of the NRIs, especially in the lower strata of society, depend on hawala transactions. They mainly use the currency notes of denominations 500 and 100 for their transactions. Though the move will cause some issues in the initial stage, it will benefit in the long run,” he said. But, in the interim, confusion reigns. “There are customers who have withdrawn large sums for marriage functions scheduled for November 10, 11, and 12. They have contacted us for guidelines, but we are clueless,” said Padmakumar, a bank employee and leader of the Bank Employees’ Federation of India in Alappuzha. In for turmoil “There is no intimation yet as to when we would get the new currency notes,” he said, hinting at the disorder awaiting the bank branches. “Trading is virtually at a standstill,” says Sabil Raj, Alappuzha district general secretary of the Kerala Vyapari Vyavasayi Ekopana Samithy. “The decision will cause some inconvenience for the farmers for a short but critical harvesting period, it is a welcome move,” says Prasanth Rajesh, Wayanad Coffee Growers’ Association president. Shaji Mullookkaran, an engineer engaged in providing support service for power inverters installed at banking institutions across Palakkad district, said it was his affinity for plastic money that helped him adhere to schedules on Wednesday. “It was a big relief on Tuesday night when a leading grocery shop in Palakkad with credit card facility sent its customers SMS saying that it would function till midnight. I went there at 11.30 p.m. to buy vegetables and other essentials. Decided not to become part of the long queue at ATMs on Tuesday night as I can fill fuel in my car using credit and debit cards. During lunch time, I opted to be in Ottappalam so that I can swipe my card at the restaurant there. It may be difficult to swipe card at restaurant if I had to go to any interior area at noon,” he said.

86,2016-11-10,3.0,Withdrawal of currency hits normal life in Thrissur,"Demonetisation hit normal life in the district on Wednesday. Though there was directive to accept currency of denominations Rs,500 and Rs.1,000 at government hospitals, Thissur Medical College didn’t accept the notes. Patients were running from pillar to post as the laboratory and pharmacy at the medical college refused to take the banned notes. Many of the patients didn’t even have money for food. Serpentine queues were witnessed at Paliyekkara Toll Plaza on National Highway, as passengers tried to collect change after paying Rs.500 and Rs.1000 toll. Passengers, including office-goers, had to wait for a long time in the queue. As the toll company closed the parallel road, even small vehicles had to wait. The markets in Sakthan Nagar remained paralysed as wholesale and retail merchants refused to take the banned notes. However, there was no ban on the notes at Guruvayur temple. The temple accepted Rs.500 and Rs.1,000 for vazhipadu. However, there was restriction at the hotels. Many hotels in the district exhibited boards showing the ban on notes. Many school authorities informed the parents via SMS that banned noted will not accepted as school fees. Tension prevailed at Chalakudy as BEVCO outlets refused to accept the Rs.500 and Rs.1,000 notes. The police had to intervene as people refused to disperse. There was no ban on notes at petrol pumps. Even the police, who slapped fine on those who didn’t wear helmets, didn’t accept the banned notes. They issued notice and asked them to pay the fine at court. The jeweleries also refused to accept Rs.500 and Rs.1000. People, who carry money to buy jewellery for wedding purposes, faced problem.

87,2016-11-10,3.0,Demonetisation sets undesirable dynamics into motion,"Raisidam Bhumanna, a Gond Adivasi from Telangraoguda in Gudihatnoor mandal of Adilabad district, was forced to exchange a demonetised Rs. 500 currency note for Rs. 450. The Rs. 500 note was paid to him by his employer towards wages at Jainoor mandal headquarters in Kumram Bheem Asifabad district. “I am lucky to get Rs. 450. Others are getting only Rs. 400,” he said, revealing the undesirable economic dynamics which were set in motion on Wednesday in the rural areas of Adilabad and other districts. “The Transco revenue wing is not accepting the Rs. 500 bill. So many of us have been turned away for not being able to produce Rs. 100 or lower denomination for paying our electricity bill,” said Thumre Manik Rao of Bhuktapur locality in Adilabad town. Vattamwar Narsaiah, a grocer and former president of Adilabad Kirana Merchants Association, said business was at its slackest, as people had no money to purchase provisions. “This is the time every month when the middle and lower middle class stock food grains,” he said. Meanwhile, the chartered accountants’ fraternity in Adilabad has welcomed the decision of the Union government to scrap higher denomination currency notes. “This will give rise to economic course correction, and people who are not resourceful will be able to fulfil their dreams like owning a house,” opined Sanjay Tulsyan, a leading CA in town. The Centre’s move to control black money has also stirred a hornet’s nest as those who had stashed away huge sums are trying to find ways to legalise the currency. “Usually, the currency hoarders will be on the lookout for small income tax returnees so that at least some quantum of black money can be converted into white through their accounts,” said a CA, who did not want to be identified.

88,2016-11-10,3.0,Manik Sarkar flays demonetisation,"Tearing into Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s decision to demonetise Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 currency notes, Tripura Chief Minister Manik Sarkar on Wednesday said it was a “gimmick” to divert people’s attention from real problems. “The Prime Minister has announced that abolition of the notes of Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 would check corruption, control black money, fake notes and transactions of money by the terrorists. This is nothing but a gimmick or stunt to divert the attention of people of the country from real problems,” the Marxist leader told reporters here. Those who deal in black money do not keep the notes in their own houses, so demonetisation of the notes would not yield any result. “Terrorists transact money through banks so banning of the notes will not help in controlling them. This measure will also not help solving the menace of counterfeit currency, because after a few days the new notes would be faked,” he said. He alleged that at least Rs 11,000 crore was taken as loans from different banks by some capitalists and industrialists but they did not return the money and the government led by Modi was trying to save the borrowers. “Is it not corruption? Why did the government not take appropriate actions against them (borrowers) and why did the government not publish their names?” he said. The BJP-led NDA government at the Centre in its poll pledge assured that black money deposited in foreign banks would be brought back to the country within 100 days. “But at least 900 days have passed and the government did not even announce the names of those corrupt people who deposited their money in foreign banks,” he said. “The country is facing unemployment problems, suicide of farmers and inflation and failing to solve these problems, he (Modi) is trying to divert people’s attention to an issue which is far from reality,” Mr Sarkar added. - PTI Printable version | Jan 7, 2017 1:09:49 AM | http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/Manik-Sarkar-flays-demonetisation/article16441722.ece © The Hindu Sita Sahani offers a snapshot of life in the time of note bans and smartphones"
89,2016-11-10,3.0,Demonetisation triggers panic,"There was unprecedented rush and chaos witnessed at several major petrol bunks in the city from the early hours of Wednesday, following the Central government’s announcement on Tuesday night of demonetisation of Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes. This triggered a panic reaction among people, who thronged petrol bunks that were one of the few places which the Central government had announced can accept the demonetised currencies. While some of the petrol bunks accepted the currency notes, a few of the smaller ones turned away customers or reportedly remained non-operational. Petrol bunks have been instructed to take these currencies till Nov. 11. Many felt it was too short a notice for the common man to make arrangements for their daily needs. What added to panic was the announcement that banks will remain closed on Wednesday and ATMs for the next two days. “We were caught unaware. Most of us have to step out early in the morning for work and adding to the problems, there was hardly any petrol left in my vehicle. I had to stand in long queues for more than an hour to fill petrol,” said V. Sandeep, an IT professional. At places like Siripuram, serpentine queues trickled on to the Andhra University main road in the morning. Many people came together to pool in the bills and filled petrol as none of the petrol bunks were giving change of Rs 100 currency note, which turned into a hot commodity. I. Padmavathi, a resident of Kancharapalem, came with four others to fill petrol at the bunk near IV Town Police Station. “My vehicle tank is small. So we could give a Rs 500 note by sharing petrol among five people,” she added. At some petrol bunks, agitated commuters were seen involved in heated arguments with the staff who refused to accept the currency notes. With the demand for Rs 100 notes suddenly escalating, some petrol bunk salesmen who accepted Rs 500 currency note for filling petrol for Rs 400 were seen returning Rs 90, pocketing the additional Rs 10. Senior citizens woes Meanwhile, many senior citizens were in a state of panic. V. Shanti Latha, resident of Pandurangapuram, woke up to the news of demonetisation of the currency notes with no lower denomination notes left with her to buy the daily groceries. “My son and daughter-in-law had to go to Hyderabad so I was left with no help. I do not know how to operate the internet nor do I have a debit card,” said the 75-year-old. Her neighbour came to her help and ordered from an e-commerce grocery store.

  Business was in low gear across the north Kerala region on Wednesday as merchants and traders tried to make sense of the demonetisation and shoppers and customers struggled hard to cope with the shortage of legal-tender money with them. People woke up to the reality that most of the cash they had with them were of no use immediately. Towns and cities in the region soon realised that they were in the grip of a financial famine. ‘Marriage shopping’ hit Kozhikode, the hub of Malabar’s trade, was under a partial commercial paralysis as the banks were shuttered, ATMs were closed and people had no money to pay for their transactions. S.M. Street in Kozhikode, the largest retail shopping centre in the entire Malabar, reflected the gloom. The area, usually bursting at the seams with shoppers, was not crowded on Wednesday. Businesses reported that sales were down to less than a half as they could not accept Rs.500 and Rs.1,000 notes. There was a heavy decline in the wedding-related purchases which are referred to as ‘marriage shopping.’ As the banks and ATMs were closed, the customers were not able to take out cash to pay for high-volume purchases. However, larger shops in S.M. Street and the upmarket ones across the city that accept credit and debit cards said there was an increase in business using the cards. Reports from Kannur, Kasaragod, Vadakara, Kanjangad, Kalpetta and many other towns indicated a marked decline in business. In the eastern upland areas, sale and purchase of agricultural products were heavily hit. A natural-rubber trader at Thiruvambadi in Kozhikode district said that he had withdrawn Rs.2 lakh, all in 500s, from his bank last evening. But, since the cash was of no use on Wednesday morning, he opted not to open his shop. Land deals Land-deal registrations across the region was crippled as the parties could not pay the registration fee and related expenses to the government in cash. For instance, at a sub-registrar office (SRO) in Kozhikode city, none of the nine registrations scheduled did not take place. A document writer told The Hindu that his client had got around Rs.5 lakh ready in 500s and 1,000s on Tuesday itself to be paid as stamp duty and registration fee. However, registration of wills and partition deeds were done as the expenses were small. Some restaurants in the city had to close in the afternoon as their customers could not pay up in small-denomination notes. Petrol pumps, which were allowed to accept the demonetised notes, however, supplied fuel for Rs.500 or its multiples.

  Though a few jewellers traded till late on Tuesday night, many said that sales remained dull in Mangaluru on Wednesday, after Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,000 notes became invalid tender on Tuesday night. There was a steady steam of visitors at a few jewellery units on M.G. Road and Balmatta Road that operated till around midnight on Tuesday. There were also visitors to jewellery units on Wednesday. A marketing executive of Malabar Gold outlet on Falnir Road said that they are only accepting payments by debit cards, cheque and Rs. 100 notes. “It is our policy. We are politely sending away people coming with Rs. 500 and Rs. 1000 notes,” the executive said. Joyalukkas adopted a similar policy. “We are clearly telling our customers that we are not dealing with Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,000 notes,” an executive of Joyalukkas unit on Falnir Road said. He said that not many customers came to the store. A senior Customs official said that the many visits by people on Tuesday night and Wednesday to jewellery units might be because of the announcement by the Centre. The official said that gold purchases in these units had had to be legal and ruled out hoarding of Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,000 notes by the jewellery stores.

  : Most of the political leaders in Tamil Nadu have welcomed Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s announcement scrapping Rs. 500 and Rs 1,000 notes. However, they want the Central government to ensure that poor and middle-class sections of the society are not affected by the measure. DMK leader M. Karunanidhi, who appreciated the move, was sceptical of the final outcome. “A similar effort was made during the Janata Party government in 1978 and Rs. 1,000, 5,000 and 10,000 notes were scrapped. But it is not clear whether it led to prevention of black money,” he said. He said the decision, in reality, would affect the poor and the middle-class, small traders and auto drivers more than the rich. ‘Modi deserves a pat’ MDMK general secretary Vaiko said Prime Minister Modi deserved praise as he had delivered a deadly blow to black money holders who had been running a parallel economy. Pointing out that the measures to smoke out the black money that Indians had stashed away in foreign bank accounts had failed, he said abolition of Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes would completely eradicate the black money within the country. “Black money caused enormous damage to Indian economy and widened the gap between the haves and the have nots,” he said. PMK youth wing leader Anbumani Ramadoss said if implemented properly, the move would benefit the country. “But it will severely affect the middle-class that has saved Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,000 notes for the marriage(s) and education of their children. The government should take steps to protect their hard-earned money,” he said. Dr. Anbumani said scrapping Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,000 notes alone would not serve the purpose of eradicating black money as money had been converted into foreign currencies, invested in shares and land and stacked in foreign banks. “The move would benefit people only if it leads to decrease in the price of land and essential commodities,” he said. However, Viduthalai Chiruthaikal Katchi president Thol. Thirumavalavan said the Prime Minister’s announcement was a drama to divert people’s attention from his election gimmick and his failure to recover black money deposited in foreign banks. “Mr. Modi’s claim that his decision would put an end to black money was laughable as black money holders do not keep hard cash,” he said, and added that the announcement had actually created a financial emergency in the country. He said Mr. Modi had behaved like a dictator and there was a danger of the country plunging into emergency. CPI(M) slams move The CPI-M’s Polit Bureau on Tuesday criticised the demonetisation of the Rs. 500 and Rs. 1000 banknotes, saying it will not unearth black money. It challenged the government to make public the name of those who hold bank deposits in tax havens and, “those refusing to return humongous loans from nationalised banks estimated at over Rs. 11 lakh crores, if it is really committed to recover and curb black money,” said the PB. “It will have limited effect and is more like political posturing .... By the Prime Minister’s own admission, the bulk of black money generation and storage is in off-shore accounts in foreign currency,” said the PB, in a statement. The PB went on to say that the new Rs. 2,000 note, along with a new Rs. 500 note, won’t prevent future counterfeit circulation.

  The day’s trail to know the impact of the sudden demonetisation of Rs.500 and Rs.1,000 currency notes had just begun. Time was 10.48 a.m. on Wednesday. Sitting in his nondescript vegetable shop near the entrance to the normally bustling Kaloor market, Jamaal wore a confused look. Just a while ago a couple of his trusted clients had paid in Rs.500 notes on shopping. “They were regulars and could not be turned away unlike people who came in the guise of customers looking for change. The real impact will be known only by Thursday when suppliers return after today’s [Thursday] motor strike,” he said. At his abattoir a few metres away, Shiraas continued to accept ‘banned’ notes. “We have no black money to hide and therefore can change these notes at the bank. Business is already bad, and we can’t afford to turn our customers away citing the note issue,” he said. At Saritha theatre, moviegoers had to check their wallets for Rs.100 or lower denomination notes. “No question of accepting bigger notes as they are no longer legal tender,” Sethunath, theatre manager, put it bluntly. There was a minor melee during the previous night’s second show. Alerted to the withdrawal of Rs.500 and Rs.1,000 notes, spectators started crowding the eatery with notes, Mathew, a ticket counter staff, recalled. At his roadside kiosk near the theatre, Noufal sat idling away his time. With just three Rs.100 notes in his cash box, he could neither buy fresh stock nor do any business. He had to turn away quite a few customers who had come with banned notes. It was 11.22 a.m., and Benjamin looked around his deserted medical shop, which usually teems with customers. With the business having been hit, he had already started accepting cards for as low a purchase as Rs.10. Anand, an employee at the Supplyco-run petrol pump near Durbar Hall Ground, expected more trouble as motorists streamed in. The lower denomination notes had literally exhausted, and customers were agitated over the failure of the outlet to tender balance. “We told them they could fill petrol for Rs.500 or Rs.1,000, but for anything less, we insisted that they give change,” he said. At just past 12 noon, the “note issue” dominated the chat between staff and passengers at the Ernakulam KSRTC depot. “Some depots had started exhibiting placards declaring that Rs.500 and Rs.1,000 notes were not accepted, though we haven’t done it as yet,” said station master Viswambaran. At Bevco’s self-serving premium outlet just a stone’s throw away beyond the A.L. Jacob flyover, employees had a leisurely day. With a board kept outside declaring that Rs.500 and Rs.1,000 notes and credit/debit cards were not accepted, sales were reduced to a trickle at the outlet, which usually logs a daily business of over Rs.10 lakh. Shiju had been operating the automatic ticket vending machine at the eastern entry of the south railway station for hours by the time the clock ticked past 12.30 p.m. He held Rs.500 and Rs.1,000 notes in one hand as if they were a testimony to his helplessness. “Passengers can either wait till enough change is collected to get the balance on buying tickets, or they can give change,” he said and passengers seem convinced.

  The sudden demonetisation move on Tuesday night turned out be a harrowing experience for a group of tourists from Kollam. The tourists, mostly retired Kerala State Road Transport Corporation employees, were on a tour to northern India. They started their journey on Tuesday afternoon by Kerala Express. Their nightmare began when they had supper from pantry car. The pantry car operators, on a directive from their bosses, refused to accept Rs.1,000 and Rs.500 notes. The tourists and their tour operator mostly carried Rs. 1,000 notes and they were unable to purchase food and other requirements. They virtually starved The entire group and even many commuters virtually starved as they could not have proper breakfast or lunch. Tour operator G. Thomaskutty, from the Thenmala Tourism Development Cooperative Society, said over the phone that since most of travellers carried notes in higher denominations, the pantry car operators even restricted the menu to snacks and tea for lunch. With the small amount of lower denomination notes, they bought snacks and shared it among themselves. Even eateries at stations such as Vijayawada refused to accept Rs.1,000 and Rs.500 notes, he said. Their destination is Agra where the train is scheduled to arrive late on Thursday morning. Mr. Thomaskutty said the tour agent at Agra informed him that things would be difficult there too, with curbs on ATM withdrawals. The group is scheduled to reach Kollam on November 17.

95,2016-11-10,3.0,Trade hit in Kollam post-demonetisation,"With the demonetisation of the higher denomination currency notes coming into effect from Tuesday night, most trading activities in the district was badly hit on Wednesday. Though people had cash with them, a bankruptcy situation prevailed because there was not much cash with people in the lower denomination notes. In spite of the ban, the withdrawn higher denomination notes continued to be accepted at the auction halls of fishing harbours in Kollam on Tuesday morning. Fishermen said fish being a highly perishable commodity they had no other go but to accept the higher denomination currency notes in the hope of getting them exchanged at banks. Most jewellery shops in the district remained closed. The gold rate for the day that is declared by 9.45 a.m. on all working days was declared only after 11.30 a.m. on Tuesday. At shops that remained open business was dull. Due to shortage of cash in the legally accepted denominations with jewellers, purchase of old jewellery was almost nil, traders said. In the morning as rumours got sparked off that liquor outlets would accept the withdrawn currency notes on Tuesday, it led to outlets getting virtually mobbed before these could open. But after opening, the expectations of the crowd got belied as notices were prominently put up that read that the withdrawn denomination currency notes would not be accepted. Business at Bevco outlets was dull on Tuesday. 'Pay only full amount' While it was notified that fuel pumps would accept the withdrawn higher denominations, the pump operators insisted that customers purchase fuel for the entire amount, if cash was given in the Rs.500 or Rs.1,000 denominations. Their excuse was that they don’t have change in the lower denominations. This led to a chaos-like situation and by afternoon most pump operators kept their outlets closed for the rest of the day. At supermarkets, cash business dipped but there was upswing of trade through credit and debit cards. Some of the supermarkets insisted that customers giving notes in the Rs.500 or Rs.1,000 denomination should mandatorily purchase for Rs.470 or Rs.930 respectively. Shops dealing in building materials and other items did most of their trade by accepting account payee cheques..

Following the directions of Chief Minister Manohar Lal Khattar in wake of the Centre’s decision to demonetise Rs 500 and Rs 1000 notes, Chief Secretary D. S. Dhesi on Wednesday convened an emergent meeting of senior officers here and passed these directions for immediate action, an official spokesman said. It was informed in the meeting that these denominations would be accepted at all petrol pumps. The VITA milk booths functioning in the State would accept existing currency notes of Rs 1000 and Rs 500 denominations at its all 399 outlets during this period, he said. Apart from the state roadways buses, permit holder bus operators would also accept these currency notes for purchase of tickets. Similarly, the purchase of DAP and seeds would also be allowed at authorised cooperative institutions by presenting the existing notes, he said. “The officers concerned were directed to coordinate with banks so as to expedite the supply of currency notes of smaller denominations like Rs 100, Rs 50, Rs 20 and Rs 10,” he said. Law and order They were also directed to ensure maintenance of law and order, especially at petrol pumps, bus stands and toll plazas so as to avoid any inconvenience to the general public, he said. Apart from this, police personnel would be deployed near banks for better management of public movement as well as traffic as a large turnout is expected for cash transaction in the banks tomorrow, he said. As per the notification of Finance Ministry, transactions with Rs 500 and Rs 1000 notes have been allowed for making payments in government hospitals for medical treatment and its pharmacies for purchase of medicines with doctor’s prescription, at railway station counters, ticket counters of government or public sector undertaking buses.

  As expected, the sudden announcement on demonetisation caused initial hiccups and a chaotic situation prevailed in the city on Wednesday. While ATMs downed their shutters in tune with the government order, there were huge crowds at all places that witness large scale cash transactions such as toll gates, railway station, central bus station and fuel stations. While petrol bunks accepted Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,000 notes, though after initial resistance, they could not generate enough change to return. As a result, they insisted on filling up tanks for the entire denomination, which resulted in friction at half a dozen locations.Pilgrims visiting the temple city from far-off places also woke up to the news and had to face hardship. “We welcome the decision, but it should have been planned and announced after careful thought so as to avoid such inconvenience to the pilgrims and the middle class population,” said social activist P. Naveenkumar Reddy, who staged a demonstration at the Rajiv Gandhi Circle by displaying the demonetised notes. Meanwhile, SP R.Jayalakshmi held a meeting with bankers and offered to arrange security in the branches going to witness heavy queues. BJP State spokesperson G. Bhanprakash Reddy welcomed the decision as ‘historic.’ Printable version | Jan 7, 2017 1:10:02 AM | http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/Demonetisation-Lack-of-information-leads-to-chaos/article16441577.ece © The Hindu Performers from India, U.S., Dubai, U.K., Russia, Hong Kong create a record 170 km of pipeline for the domestic sector, 30 km for industrial sector have been laid"
98,2016-11-10,3.0,Demonetisation trolls dominate social media,"Social media had only one topic trending in the hours after the Centre announced the demonetisation of Rs.500 and Rs.1,000 notes on Tuesday night as in one sweep, it upstaged the entire debate about the US presidential election. Soon after posts alerting to the declaration of demonetisation by the Prime Minister, a no-holds-barred social media spar of trolls between pro-Modi and anti-Modi camp followers erupted. This was interspersed with serious posts for and against the view that the move would check black money. But the most entertaining were posts and trolls by people who owed allegiance to neither camp but tried to find the funny side of a new dawn without the ‘big’ notes. One such troll made a mock request to Prime Minister Modi on behalf of Indian expats not to declare Indian passports invalid for travelling to India one fine midnight. There were plenty of trolls drawing link between demonetisation and the state of mind of political leaders. A former Chief Minister and his two Cabinet colleagues in the UDF government who are facing corruption charges were the pick of such trolls which said that they were yet to regain consciousness after collapsing on hearing the declaration. Another post featured a dialogue from the blockbuster movie Aaram Thampuran delivered by Mohanlal that there would come a time when bundles of notes would not even have the value of paper. An aggrieved troller felt the government was beating up the entire population for the crime committed by a few by withdrawing currency notes all of a sudden. As posts emerged from a pro-BJP camp that the new currency notes to be launched were to feature nano GPS, that became the theme of a flurry of trolls. One seemingly innocuous post with dollops of sarcasm wondered whether the GPS in currency notes could be leveraged for Wi-Fi connectivity. Another troll wanted to know whether those currency notes would have 13 mega pixel camera and such other features of a smart phone. Many posted images of wallets containing a few soiled Rs.10 notes and coins with the caption that it was one of those rare moments when being poor felt being good. Malayalees’ penchant for ‘spirited’ trolls came to the fore as there appeared ones which downplayed the information on places where the banned notes would be accepted with a query whether they would be accepted at Bevco outlets. “The most repeated question today is whether cards are accepted at Bevco outlets,” said another troll.

99,2016-11-10,3.0,Demonetisation has badly affected the poor: Amarinder,"Punjab Congress president Captain Amarinder Singh on Wednesday criticised the manner in which the Modi government handled the demonetisation process, saying it has led to chaos and hit small farmers, traders, daily wage workers the hardest. “Though the move was a step in the right direction in order to curb corruption, terror funding and black marketing, the way it had been handled had led to chaos, with the small farmers, traders, daily wagers and the poor the worst hit,” said the Punjab Pradesh Congress Committee (PPCC) president. Pointing out that many of these people do not even have bank accounts, he asked how they could be expected to change their 500 and 1000 rupee notes. These poor people, he said, had been caught in a sorry situation as a result of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s quick-fix solution, which had failed to take into account the problems of the vast majority of the Indians. “In his haste to throw a net over black money network in the country, Modi seemed to have forgotten that the large percentage of Indians were neither corrupt nor were involved black or hawala money transactions,” he said. “These are the people who earn a few hundreds rupees a month and save even less, and have no bank accounts in which to put these measly sums,” said Mr Singh, adding that no thought or planning appeared to have gone into the implementation of the Modi government’s decision. As far as the impact of the move on the Punjab elections is concerned, he said the Congress had no cause for concern. It was the ruling Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) and the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) that needed to worry, he said. “While Badals stand to lose thousands of crores of rupees of their black money as a result of the demonetisation, AAP supremo Arvind Kejriwal would also end up losing hundreds of crores,” he added. - PTI “Poor people caught in a sorry situation as a result of Narendra Modi’s quick-fix solution” Printable version | Jan 7, 2017 1:10:05 AM | http://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/Demonetisation-has-badly-affected-the-poor-Amarinder/article16441709.ece © The Hindu The Hindu revisits the gruesome December 2012 gang-rape to examine if Delhi is any safer for the average woman today"

  The demonetisation of Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,000 rupee notes stumped the public virtually leading to scramble for Rs. 100 currency notes and impacting business to a certain extent here on Wednesday. With banks and Automated Teller Machines remaining shut for the day, the common man had no avenue to exchange Rs. 500 and Rs.1, 000 notes in their possession. Ever since the news of the Centre’s sudden announcement broke out on Tuesday night and went viral in the social media, traders put out messages outside their establishments that they would not accept Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,000 notes. Business was not brisk on Wednesday like the previous day with some commercial outlets in the city shutting shops due to this sudden development, according to the trading community here. Although the Central government had made it clear that petrol stations would accept Rs.500 and Rs. 1,000 notes, it was not all that easy for consumers here. Many fuel stations did not accept Rs. 500 or Rs. 1,000 notes citing shortage of Rs. 100 and Rs. 50 notes leaving several public fuming. Some fuel stations accepted Rs. 500 note on the condition that fuel for that amount was purchased, complained residents. Power consumers were forced to return home without paying electricity bill as the staff refused to accept Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,000 notes leading to confusion. A group of residents vent their ire by staging a protest near the Electricity Board office at Thennur prompting the intervention of the police. “I could not pay the EB bill on Wednesday on the eve of the last day for payment. The government should have included EB offices also along with fuel stations in accepting Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,000 currency notes”, said P. Selvam, a city resident. Many rail travellers who had Rs. 500 notes in their possession to buy tickets had to face the same problem at Railway Junction here on Wednesday. Railway officials made announcements through the public address system requesting travellers to tender exact fare to buy tickets. The counter staff expressed their inability to accept Rs. 500 notes to give ticket as they faced shortage of change subjecting passengers, who had come with their family and children, in a quandary. The sudden action impacted hoteliers where the business was dull. A customer care manager of a prominent hotel in the city near the central bus stand said they accepted debit card from consumers instead of Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,000 notes. The hotel which usually is abuzz with people throughout the day was not the same on Wednesday as business came down, he claimed. Business was down in many jewellery shops, jewellers said. Unable to bring money in Rs. 100 denominations several public desisted from visiting jewellery shops hitting business on Wednesday, said C. Damodaran, secretary of the Tiruchi District Jewellers Association. The Tamil Nadu Traders Federation state general secretary Ve. Govindarajulu said several business establishments had downed shutters in the city. Retail trade remained largely hit as shopkeepers felt severe shortage of lower denominations. Traders and public were the most hit by the sudden move, he added. Consumer activist M. Sekaran, however, said though the drastic step was aimed at rooting out black money, the government could have done it in a manner without taking the common man by surprise and affecting him. No doubt the move has shocked the common man, nevertheless if the action was aimed at combating corruption and black money it should be welcomed keeping in mind the nation’s interest, Radhakrishnan, a city resident, felt.

  Despite clarification from the Union government on the ways to encash currency notes of Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,000 denomination, many people appeared confused about the matter on Wednesday and got into petty quarrels with traders. Meanwhile, serpentine queues were seen in front of petrol stations in the districts of north and central Karnataka. The most affected were the small businessmen, street vendors and the common man, many of whom were still not sure about what to do with the high-denomination notes in hand. Those who had heard about the demonetisation of Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,000 notes wanted to dispose them of as early as possible. In buses, for example, there were quarrels after commuters gave Rs. 500 notes to bus conductors for tickets costing below Rs. 100. Left with no option, a few conductors forced passengers to alight at the bus stations. At the weekly sante (bazaar) at Lingarajnagar in Hubballi, vegetable vendors and buyers got into altercations, and elders of the locality had to step in to resolve the arguments. Seeking change In cities and towns across north Karnataka, long queues were seen in front fo petrol bunks as both the high-denomination notes were accepted there. However, after obliging initially, many petrol station owners asked vehicle owners to either purchase fuel for Rs. 500 or Rs. 1,000 or pay in change. In Chitradurga, by afternoon petrol bunk owners were giving change only to those buying fuel for more than Rs. 300. Medical stores in hospitals were also full of people purchasing medicines for Rs. 25 or Rs. 50 just to get change. However, many people felt that while they would be inconvenienced for a few days, the move would ultimately help in curbing black money.

102,2016-11-10,3.0,Rs.37 crore in fake currency seized in five years,"Delhi Police officers have said that the government’s move to declare Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,000 notes as illegal tender will help curb circulation of Fake Indian Currency Notes (FICN). The officials said that the nearly Rs. 37 crore worth of counterfeit currency they have recovered over the past five years is just the tip of the iceberg. A senior police officer, who has been a part of both the units dealing with FICN -- Special Cell and Crime Branch, said that the move will also choke terror funding as the money is pumped from Pakistan through various routes in fake currency of denominations, primarily of Rs.500 and Rs.1,000. Rs.5 notes While 55,785 notes of Rs. 1,000 were seized in 2012, the corresponding number for Rs. 500 notes was 1,26,822. Surprisingly, denominations as low as Rs. 5 are also printed. As recently as last year, 11,000 counterfeit five rupee notes were recovered by the police. Terror fund The officer said that the now repealed Prevention of Terrorism Act, 2002 (POTA) had stricter punishment for funding terror, but while that applied to individuals, the latest move has meant that the jugular vein has been cut. Also, the cases unearthed so far have pointed to mass-scale printing of notes across the border with millions invested in printing costs. He said that the sleeper cells also store cash in the same denominations and with one stroke, all those notes were made redundant.

103,2016-11-10,3.0,"Rs. 1000, Rs. 500 still have some takers","Not everyone is shunning denominations of Rs. 500 and Rs. 1000, there are many in the city who are taking advantage of the ban to boost their business. From eateries to health clubs to events, prospective clients were contacted on Wednesday on social media platforms to buy passes or take membership by paying with the phased-out Rs. 500 or Rs. 1000 notes in their possession. For the upcoming Sunburn event to be held on November 12, Saturday, where international artistes will take the stage, a ticketing volunteer grabbed attention with his message which went viral on WhatsApp. “It was a marketing strategy to reach out to the people,” said the volunteer and a member of the event management crew who did not wish to be quoted. “There was panic among youngsters on how they can pay for the passes. We wanted to convey that we are accepting cash including Rs. 500 and Rs. 1000 notes to clear the confusion. After we sent out the message, we did get enquiries from those who wanted to buy tickets offline by paying cash.” A gym in Jubilee Hills too sent a similar message to its members. The management of Chizel Gym accepted demonetised notes throughout Wednesday for the renewal of the membership of its customers. A go-to place for those requiring loose change, the agents outside the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) in Saifabad did brisk business on Wednesday. Instead of coins, the traders were equipped with bundles of Rs. 100 notes. The agents were seen exchanging Rs. 400 of Rs. 100 denominations in exchange for Rs 500 note. “I require change otherwise my business will suffer,” said T. Venkatesh, who runs a bakery in Abids. “Though the commission is high I do not have an option as I have to oblige my customers and also buy groceries.” Printable version | Jan 7, 2017 1:10:10 AM | http://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/Rs.-1000-Rs.-500-still-have-some-takers/article16441656.ece © The Hindu Organisers plan to put up ‘aesthetic’ billboards and bring art into the public domain"

  The voiding of two common denominations of currency since midnight on Tuesday threw normal life out of gear in the city as several shops and restaurants downed shutters. Ever since the announcement about the Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,000 notes ceasing to be legal tender was made public, long queues had formed outside ATMs on Tuesday night as people tried to withdraw Rs. 100 denomination currency or make a deposit on CDR machines. Though petrol/diesel outlets, apart from government hospitals and milk booths, were allowed to accept the soon-to-be-obsolete currency, several fuelling stations shut shop as they ran out of change. Jewellery shops were open but business was well under par. Major retailers displayed boards stating that Rs. 1000 and Rs. 500 notes would not be accepted. “Gold is normally the safest choice of consumers to safeguard their small savings, but the demonetisation decision which came at about the time shops were closing neutralised that option,” said N. Naveen Baalaji, managing partner of Sri Lakshmi Jewellery. “Shopping sentiment has soured and we expect it to remain so for the next few days as people are looking to stay afloat,” he said. While most shopping outlets deemed it prudent to simply down shutters, in the ones that stayed open, transactions were confined to credit/debit cards. Goubert Market on Nehru Street was a pale shadow of its usual bustling self as only small change was accepted by the vendors. The demonetisation also caught tourists, especially foreigners, completely unawares. Martin and his spouse from Australia were among the scores of tourists taken unawares by the demonetisation. “We didn’t realise we were holding invalidated currency until we stepped out of our hotel rooms in the morning to buy some stuff from a superstore,” Mr. Martin said. The visitors who are staying at the Ashram were told that the store would not accept the Rs. 500 note. “We were told that we could use notes only against purchases for about Rs. 450,” said Mr. Martin. On being informed of the demonetisation, they began to hunt for a bank to convert the currency only to learn that banks too were closed for the day. They have shelved their plans for shopping and hope to file up before a bank ahead of opening hour to convert currency on Thursday.

105,2016-11-11,4.0,IIP rebounds but demonetisation a dampener,"Industrial output grew 0.7% in Sept. headed by the consumer durables sector.—FILE PHOTO: REUTERS
  Industrial output grew 0.7 per cent in September compared with the same period a year ago, snapping a two-month contraction, government data showed. The Index of Industrial Production contracted 0.7 per cent in August, and shrank 2.5 per cent in July. The move back into growth territory was driven mainly by consumer goods, with consumer durables especially seeing a strong turnaround. A healthy contribution by consumer durables is likely to be short-lived, with experts saying that the government’s demonetisation move will dampen consumption in the remaining two quarters of the year. “Growth has come in at 0.7 per cent for the month, which is much lower than our expectation of 3.1 per cent which was based on the better performance of infra industries and retail sales in October which should have been backed up by higher production,” Madan Sabnavis, Chief Economist at Care Ratings said. “The recent demonetization will push back consumption in Q3 and a recovery can be seen with a lag in Q4 at best.” “Under these circumstances we expect IIP growth for the year to be between 1-2 per cent as against 3-4 per cent posted earlier,” Mr. Sabnavis added. The consumer durables category in the IIP grew a robust 14 per cent in September, up from the 2.2 per cent seen in August. This pushed the growth of the overall consumer goods category up to 6 per cent in September from the 0.7 per cent in August. The capital goods category extended its run of poor performance with 11 consecutive months of contraction. The category contracted 21.6 per cent in September compared with 22 per cent in August. The manufacturing sector recovered marginally, growing 0.9 per cent following two consecutive months of contraction. The electricity sector grew 2.4 per cent in September, much faster than the 0.1 per cent growth rate seen in August. “In terms of industries, twelve out of the 22 industry groups in the manufacturing sector have shown positive growth during the month of September 2016 as compared to the corresponding month of the previous year,” according to a government statement.

106,2016-11-11,4.0,Demonetisation: Residents continue to grapple with after-effects,"The city continued to grapple with the after-effects of the decision by the Centre to demonetise Rs. 1,000 and Rs. 500 notes, on Friday. Many faced difficulties in withdrawing cash from their bank accounts and from ATM kiosks. People had to wait in long queues at the branches of nationalised and private banks to avail new notes after surrendering their demonetised notes and to withdraw cash from their accounts. The delay in commencement of the functioning of ATMs added to the woes. Migrant labours working for various construction projects were the worst affected by the demonetisation. Subrata Modak and five others from West Bengal, working as masons for a project of construction of a multi-storied building, were standing in a queue before a nationalised bank at Mahaveer Circle. Mr. Modak said that the refusal to accept Rs. 1,000 and Rs. 500 notes at hotels and grocery shops on Wednesday and Thursday created many problems for them. Some grocery shop owners refused to tender change and demanded that they make purchases for the full amount. Mr. Modak and his friends had availed leave from work on Friday and were waiting in queue to get the new notes in exchange of demonetised notes with them. Yogishwarappa, a resident of Danihalli near here, had been to the city to attend a wedding. A friend from his village, who is suffering from an auto-immune disease, requested him to bring home medicines. Mr. Yogishwarappa said he had planned to purchase the medicines by withdrawing cash using his debit card. He expressed displeasure against the delay in opening of ATM kiosks and said that the government should have intimated the people on the actual time of commencement of the service of cash withdrawal at ATM kiosks to avoid inconvenience. At many banks, there was delay in honouring cheques for withdrawal of money from accounts owing to deficit of cash. Some ATM kiosks in downtown areas, including B.H. Road, Nehru Road and Park Extension commenced functioning at 4 p.m., but ran out of cash within a hour.

Kannan has hailed the decision of Prime Minister Narendra Modi to withdraw Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,000 currency notes. Terming the decision “very bold and a historic step towards curbing corruption,” he said all political parties should support the move so that the menace of black money would come to an end. “I fully support the Prime Minister in my personal capacity. No other Prime Minister has taken such a bold decision in Independent India. In the beginning, there will be some inconvenience to the people but in the long run it will help strengthen the country,” he said in a statement. Mr. Kannan, who unsuccessfully contested the Assembly election on AIADMK ticket after quitting the Congress, had been keeping a low profile after the electoral débâcle. The former Congress leader had not been seen on the campaign trail in Nellithope where AIADMK candidate Om Sakthi Sekar is pitted against Chief Minister V. Narayanasamy leading to speculation in political circles. Sources in the AIADMK said several top leaders of the party had contacted him to join the campaign but so far Mr. Kannan had kept a stoic silence.

108,2016-11-11,4.0,Karnataka?s film industry dismayed by demonetisation,": The demonetisation of existing Rs. 500 and Rs. 1000 notes, and the introduction of Rs. 2,000 currency notes have seriously affected the Kannada film industry, especially the exhibition sector. Two films that were expected to release today have been postponed. Producers attributed the decision to the paucity of currency of smaller denominations with the audience. Exhibitors, especially owners of single screens, are planning to stop screening films if the situation does not improve by tomorrow. K.V. Chandrashekar, owner of three single screens, told The Hindu that the impact of demonetisation doubled with the circulation of new Rs. 2,000 notes. “Most people are bringing Rs. 2,000 notes but we are not in a position to return Rs.1,920 to them as the ticket rate is only Rs. 80. So they are returning disappointed. Viewership has also reduced significantly. What is the best we can do under the circumstances, except stop screening?” he asked. It’s a similar situation in most single screens across the state, especially in Bengaluru, said Mr. Thomas D’ Souza, proprietor of single screens in the outskirts of the city. Multiplexes have also been affected although their situation is not as difficult as that of the small screens. A senior executive from PVR Cinemas said on condition of anonymity, “It has impacted us to a certain extent, but not much.” The demonetisation has affected the prospects of films that are ready for release, or on the sets, to a certain extent, admits Sa. Ra.

109,2016-11-11,4.0,Demonetisation hits NRIs,"HYDERABAD: Demonetisation of Rs.500 and Rs.1,000 currency notes has not only taken the Indian citizens by surprise but also has created some issues for the Non Resident Indians living overseas. The ripple effect of cancellation of high value notes has been felt across the borders with huge population of Indian diaspora living in countries like the US, Canada, the UK and Dubai, among others as they suddenly found themselves holding worthless Indian currency. “Many are irked by the fact that there is no clarity yet on how they can exchange these invalid notes and where,” said Malini who got a call from her friend Anuradha living in Canada. Some of them plan to send the cash with their relatives or friends travelling to India to be exchanged before the deadline or to be deposited in banks here. But not many are comfortable with the idea either, Ms.Malini said. Many NRIs who are in similar situation made attempts to exchange the cash but there are no takers as yet for want of clarity or instructions from Indian government to their embassies and High Commissions. This according to NRI sources in Toronto, became quite an issue that found coverage in the local newspapers too. No travel plans Syamala, a US citizen, who keeps few thousands of Indian currency mostly in high value notes, to spend during her trips to India, has no clue how she can exchange the invalid notes in her possession now. “I don’t plan to travel to India at least for next eight months nor I can exchange them with foreign currency now,” she rues. The NRIs and Indians with US,UK citizenship have been calling their friends and families back home on how they could exchange the cash stuck with them as most of them do not have plans to travel to India in the near future. William, who works for a UK based MNC, travels to India on work for the company’s Indian subsidiary. He called his colleagues here to ask how he could exchange the USD 400 worth Indian currency in his possession. Sandilya, an architect who works in Dubai, said he had a few Rs.500 notes which he tried to exchange with a currency exchange firm in Dubai. But they refused to accept the cancelled Indian currency in the absence of instructions either from Indian government or the currency exchange’s head office. “Many of us have no idea what to do with the few Rs.500 and Rs.1,000 notes we have now. There is no communication for NRIs either from the Indian government or banks so far,” he said.

As the crisis continued for the second day on Friday in the island after Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced that the two high-denomination currency notes ceased to be legal tender, the boat owners could not mobilise money for purchasing the essential items for fishing and decided to abstain from fishing. As traders and retail fish vendors also expressed difficulty in lifting the catch, leaders of 11 fishermen associations discussed the issue at an emergency meeting and decided not to venture into the sea for fishing till normalcy was restored, P. Sesu Raja, a fishermen’s leader, said. The fishermen decided to abstain from fishing for a week as they felt that the situation would not ease immediately. Purchase of diesel and making advance payment to the fish workers became a big problem, he said. Traders and retail fish vendors also expressed difficulty in selling sea products and advised the fishermen to abstain from fishing, the fishermen’s leaders said. After the situation eased, the leaders would meet again and take a decision on resuming fishing after assessing the situation, a resolution adopted at the meeting said. Though the Centre and banking sector announced that the situation would ease in two days, most of the ATMs remained shut or ran out of cash, the leaders said.

  As demonetisation of high value notes hit small businessmen across the city, sex workers of Sonagachi here, South Asia’s largest redlight area are seeing brisk business as they are aceepting high denomination notes. “Our girls have been asked to accept Rs. 500 and Rs. 1000 notes. But they are telling customers that they will not accept those after this week. Therefore there is a huge rush of customers. “Although sex workers in top categories are facing no problem but those who take only Rs 300 to Rs 400 are facing great difficulty,” said Bharati, the mentor of the Durbar Mahila Samanwaya Committee, a sex workers’ organisation which has 1.3 lakh registered sex workers under it across Bengal. Sex workers who charge below Rs. 500 are facing tough time as they have hardly got any customers in last two days. Prospective customers first inquire whether the sex workers will accept Rs 500 and Rs 1000 notes. “If we say no we will lose the customer. We have to accept the notes and Durbar and Usha bank had assured us that our money will not go in waste,” said Rekha a sex worker. In the last two days, sex workers in and around Sonagachi have deposited more than Rs. 55 lakh in Usha Multipurpose Cooperative Bank, which was formed and is run by former sex workers in 2001 for women in the same trade. “Due to the huge rush of customers in Sonagachi, the sex workers in last two days have deposited more than Rs 50 lakh in their bank accounts in Usha Bank. Generally sex workers prefer to keep money in their homes but after demonetization, there is a rush among sex workers to deposit money in the bank,” Shantanu, a senior official of Usha Bank said.

116,2016-11-11,4.0,Demonetisation will greatly benefit economy: Amit Shah,"BJP chief Amit Shah at the party headquarters in New Delhi.
  BJP national president Amit Shah on Friday dared the opposition to make a political issue of the demonetisation of Rs. 500 and Rs. 1000 notes, announced by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on November 8. In a historic decision of this sort “some pain was inevitable” but the government would protect the interest of the honest tax payers, farmers, housewives, and the poor, Mr. Shah said.     His remarks came in the background of a notice moved by the Trinamool Congress in the Rajya Sabha questioning the government’s move and statements terming the move as an attempt at imposing an “economic emergency” by BSP chief Mayawati.   “I want the opposition to try and make this a political issue. The people are with the government on this unprecedented move to fight black money, corruption and terror funding. It is an economic emergency for Mayawatiji perhaps,” he said, when asked whether the move would be a poll plank in the upcoming Assembly elections in Uttar Pradesh, Punjab and Uttarakhand.   “In this country there are elections every year and this decision has not been taken keeping politics in mind,” he added.   Poser to parties   “I do want to ask the Congress, the Samajwadi Party, the BSP, the Aam Aadmi Party and the Trinamool Congress as to why they are upset? They should answer whether they are in support of black money? Or hawala traders, drug peddlers, or terror funders? Because those are the only people this move hurts,” Mr. Shah said.   He appealed to the people to be patient for the long term betterment of the economy. He admitted that the BJP’s core voter base of small traders have been in touch with the party leaders.   ‘No prior knowledge’   He emphatically denied that the BJP or anyone in its organisation had prior knowledge of the move. “Except the government ministers and officials and those constitutionally obligated to be informed, no one knew about the move,” he said.   “We are aware that there is some discomfort to the people over this, but when such tough decisions are taken, this happens. Except that lasting discomfort will be for those who have black money, the discomfort to the honest tax payer will be of a few days,” he said.

117,2016-11-11,4.0,The Dummies? Guide to Demonetisation,"What do I do with my Rs. 500/- and Rs. 1000/- notes now that they’ve ceased to be legal tender? Are they worthless now? No, these notes still have value. You can stop taking photos of them as wrappers of peanuts to circulate on Whatsapp. There are two things you can do with the notes you have on hand – deposit them in your bank account or exchange them for notes of other denomination. There is no limit for the old notes to be deposited in your bank account, and the money will get credited in your account immediately. Also, you can get these high denomination notes exchanged for notes of other denomination at any bank or post office where you don't have an account, provided you produce any identity card issued by the government. There is, however, a limit for getting old notes exchanged. It is Rs. 4,000. And now that the ATMs are open, you can withdraw a maximum of Rs. 2,000. But Rs. 4,000/- is simply not enough for me! If you’re in need of more money even after getting Rs. 4,000 in exchange, you can withdraw from your account the existing balance, or load the defunct notes into the account and make withdrawals in denominations of Rs. 100, Rs. 50, Rs. 20 and Rs. 10. The limit for a withdrawal a day is Rs. 10,000. It is capped at Rs. 20,000 a week. As the daily limit varies between banks, it is better to ask your banker and act accordingly. How much time do I have to exchange my money? You have till December 30 to exchange the high denomination currency, or deposit them in your bank accounts. If you are in possession of these notes after December 30, you have till March 31 to file a declaration with the RBI to get them exchanged. After that, they’re as good as paper. I’m not sure I want to deposit my money – apparently, there’s a penalty of 200% on deposits! No, there’s not. There’s no limit or penalty on the amount of money you deposit in your account right now.　 But the Revenue Secretary said so! Our deposits are going to be tracked! Brevity may be the soul of wit, but unfortunately, not of The Income Tax Act, 1961. The Revenue Secretary has said (rather, tweeted) four very important statements, which are to be analysed before arriving at any conclusions. The first statement is as follows. 1. ""We would be getting reports of all cash deposited during 10th Nov to 30th Dec.2016 above threshold of Rs.2.5 lac in each A/C."" Now, the first tweet talks about a Rs. 2.5 Lakh threshold. This is not an arbitrary number. It is the maximum exemption limit for income tax for individuals. Basically, you are not liable to pay the tax if your annual earnings are below Rs. 2.5 Lakhs. So if you’re a non-earning member who has saved money, you can deposit your savings of up to Rs.2.5 lakhs without wondering if you’ll be pulled up by the tax authorities for having money in your account, out of the blue. If you’re a senior citizen over the age of 60, the limit goes up to Rs. 3 Lakhs, and if you’re a super senior citizen over the age of 80, 5 Lakhs. Next, he talks about ‘getting reports’. The fact is that the government and Revenue Department had been keeping track of high value cash deposits for a few years now. If you have seen your tax credit statement, the 26 AS, there is a section called ""Annual Information Return"", where banks are mandatorily required to furnish information about high value transactions that are linked with your PAN. So keeping track of your cash deposits (especially high value deposits) is not something novel that the government is going to do now that the demonetisation has been announced. But what about the tweets where he talks about income tax action and 200% penalty? This is what his other three tweets said: 2. >""Income Tax department would do matching of this with income returns filled by the depositors. And suitable action may follow."" 3. >""If cash amount of above Rs10 lac is deposited in a bank a/c not matching with declared income, same will be treated as tax evasion"" 4. >""In such case,tax amount plus a penalty of 200% of the tax payable would be levied as per Section 270(A) of the income tax Act"" We are in November 2016, which forms part of the Financial Year 2016-17. You are required to file your Income Tax Returns for this financial year by 31st July 2017 (the regular due date) to declare your income, or you can take time up to March 2019 to file it under the belated provisions (although you lose the benefit of being able to revise your return). First, keep in mind that the income tax authorities have access to your 26AS, where there are details of both the income earned (on which tax has been deducted at source), as well as high value transactions that were reported in the AIR. If you report or declare your ‘large’ deposit of cash in your account along with the income you have normally earned during the year, and pay tax on both your income as well as the deposit, then you will see no further consequences. If, on the other hand, if you don’t declare the deposit, there is a 
chance
 that your return of income will be picked up for scrutiny by the Income Tax authorities, wherein they will question the source of your deposit, and ask for an explanation. If you are able to substantiate a legitimate source, and the authorities are satisfied with your explanation, then you don’t face a penalty. If, however, the case is such that you have intentionally suppressed facts, recorded false entries in books, or that you aren’t able to substantiate evidence, then the authority will pass an order stating that you have misreported your income for the year, and you will be liable to pay a penalty of 200% tax on misreported income. Note that it isn’t 200% of the income itself, but on the tax component. Also note that in order for penalty to rise, three conditions have to be fulfilled. First, you should have omitted the deposit from the declaration of income in your income tax return. Second, your return should have been pulled up for scrutiny. Third, upon given the chance to explain the source of said omitted deposit, you are unable to substantiate evidence to prove its legitimacy. Unless all three are fulfilled, penalty does not arise. Ok, help me understand with an example - If I have one crore of cash to deposit, what is the penalty I should pay? If you deposit the one crore in your bank account, show it in your income tax return for the FY 2016-17, and pay tax on your income at the maximum marginal rate (assuming that you are not claiming it as business income, where you are given the benefit of claiming expenditure), you are NOT liable for any penalty, because it is not misreported income. The tax authorities will see that you have declared it and paid tax on it, thus making the deposit a legitimate credit. If, on the other hand, you deposit this one crore in your bank account, omit it from your declaration of income (and therefore not pay any tax on it), and your return gets picked up for scrutiny, you will be given an opportunity by the authorities to explain the source. If you are unable to substantiate and prove that the cash you deposited is a fruit of money that you’ve earned legally and paid tax on, it will be considered misreported income, and you’ll be required to pay 200% tax on this misreported income as penalty. So… If they’re legitimately earned cash deposits whose source you can explain – no penalty. If you intend on showing it in your income tax return, including it in your income earned during the year, and pay tax on it – no penalty If it’s a deposit that you’ve not declared/omitted from your return, not paid tax on, and aren’t able to prove as legitimate if and when your return of income is picked up for scrutiny – penalty. Any other advice? Try your best to exchange and withdraw minimally, ensuring that people from lower income groups who survive entirely on cash aren’t sent back on account of lack of funds. Use mobile wallet services, debit and credit cards instead. Wherever possible, give underprivileged people you know, change for their Rs. 500/- and Rs. 1000/- notes when they ask for it during these few weeks. You could also guide them on how they can get their money exchanged, or exchange it on their behalf. The most important piece of advice I can give you, is this – If you have a considerable amount of cash to be deposited, or know someone who does, or are generally looking for comprehensive information and customized advice relating to the demonetization scheme, hire a Chartered Accountant to help you with the process, instead of looking to twitter and social media to clear your doubts. Seriously.

  Taking advantage of the widespread panic triggered by the government’s decision to scrap Rs.500 and Rs.1,000 denominations, gangs of entry operators have become active, offering exchange of old to newly printed notes at rates ranging from 5 to 40 per cent. Several operators are directly approaching people queued up at banks to help them exchange as many Rs.500 and Rs.1,000 notes as required by arranging people with valid identification cards. One person is currently allowed to get converted cash of Rs.4,000 per day. While small-time operators are charging 5 per cent for exchanging notes, the rate goes up to 40 per cent for larger amounts, running into lakhs. In case of huge cash, the operators have been offering exchange after a period of about three months, the time they would take to push the old notes into the banking system through a large network of entry agents working in different banks in various States. It would also require surreptitious transportation of cash by carriers. “If our banking operations are foolproof, such modus operandi being employed to somehow convert the unaccounted cash into new currency notes will not succeed. However, if these elements manage to either hoodwink the banking system or connive with insiders, their job gets done. At the branch level, it would be important to ensure that cash handlers verify the original and valid identification documents of depositors and keep a proper record of the same,” said a PSU bank official. The official said there was also a possibility of the same set of identification documents being used at various banks for the purpose, which should be prevented. “The very essence of the entire exercise is to exchange only that much cash which gets back into the banking system. Therefore, proper verification of identities of depositors and follow-up action is a must. Bank account holders should deposit large sums of cash directly in their accounts instead of going for exchange of notes,” said the official. While entry operators are busy making money out of the demonetised currency, a significant amount is also being used to purchase “black” gold and precious gems. In the black market, 10-gram gold is currently worth over Rs.50,000 as against the official value of about Rs.31,000.

Mr. Mulayam and Ms. Mayawati said the Centre’s move had led to chaos and confusion, and adversely affected access to services and normal life for the poor, farmers, labourers, small traders and women. BJP exudes confidence The BJP has, however, in its public rallies and statements, popularised the demonetisation as a “surgical strike” against black money, and off-the-record, its leaders exude confidence that its political opponents would be worst affected due to the prevalence of unaccounted cash in campaigning in the State. They claimed Ms. Mayawati’s call for an emergency meeting of office-bearers on Thursday and Mr. Mulayam’s demand for a rollback for a certain period were hints that the parties were rattled. Ms. Mayawati’s opponents and rebels have often accused her of auctioning party tickets. Many SP leaders, including controversial minister and Mulayam-confidant Gayatri Prasad Prajapati, are also accused of amassing disproportionate wealth. Without naming anybody, BJP vice-president Dinesh Sharma took a dig at the SP and BSP for their opposition to the demonetisation. “Some parties are saying they should get more time so that they can convert black money into white. Some political parties are depressed,” Mr. Sharma said. ‘Sadistic pleasure’ While lashing out strongly at Mr. Modi, Ms. Mayawati said the sudden decision to demonetise currency notes of Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,000 seemed less in public and national interest and more of a “sadistic pleasure”. If the Modi government was honest about fighting black money, why did it wait for more than two-and-a-half years after coming to power, she wondered. Ms. Mayawati said the common refrain was that the BJP had taken the step after it had “done bandobast” (taken measures) to financially strengthen it by stashing funds abroad through its collusion with capitalists, whom it favoured. The BJP has stacked enough funds abroad to serve it for a hundred years, she said. “Now that they are done with it, they are remembering black money,” she said. While reiterating that his party supported the fight against black money and was “against its use in elections”, Mr. Mulayam Singh said chaos had been unleashed in the name of bringing back black money. He said the sudden scrapping of notes had caused a lack of trust in business, social tension, and an adverse impact on women. ‘Blind following’ “Common people should get a chance. Later, nobody should be given a chance. After that we are with you in this fight against black money,” Mr. Mulayam Singh told reporters. The SP chief said, “it seems Modi wants to mortgage the nation in the hands of some capitalist families,” even as he said his party would protest against the decision. Referring to the death of an invalid woman due to shock in Kushinagar as she was stranded with Rs. 500 notes, Mr. Mulayam demanded that the cut-off deposit for women be increased to Rs. 5 lakh. The BSP chief also attacked BJP chief Amit Shah for lauding Mr. Modi’s step as a “surgical strike,” saying it was an instance of “blind following”. If the government had raided the homes of the top 500 or 1,000 capitalists and recovered black money, it could be termed as a surgical strike, she said. ‘Poor inconvenienced’ Ms. Mayawati also wondered how the demonetisation would help curb black money when more than half of the country’s 125 crore people were poor small traders and labourers. “Do they have black money that they are being subjected to inconvenience?” she asked. “How can we expect a government to end corruption when it helped corruption accused Vijay Mallya and Lalit Modi escape abroad?” Printable version | Jan 7, 2017 1:11:08 AM | http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/SP-BSP-object-to-demonetisation-says-it%E2%80%99s-akin-to-Emergency/article16442080.ece © The Hindu Sita Sahani offers a snapshot of life in the time of note bans and smartphones"

  The arc lights went dark in the cash-dependent film industry in Thiruvananthapuram and Hyderabad, as technicians walked away even from star projects and the release of big films was postponed. When Prime Minister Narendra Modi was announcing the big decision on black money and fake currency on Tuesday night, Nadirshah, in Chennai, was making the final arrangements to release his new Malayalam film. Kattappanayile Hrithik Roshan was scheduled to reach cinemas on Friday. Its release has now been postponed by a week, as is Dhyan Sreenivasan-starrer Ore Mukham. “There is no point in releasing a film when people have no currency notes, so I felt I should delay the release,” Nadirshah said on Thursday. “If I was the viewer, my priority would not be to spend my money on a film at a time like this,” he said. While he had the option to postpone the release, others with movies already in theatres could only suffer losses. “There has been a sharp decline in the box office collection over the last two days,” said A.P. Hubai, manager, Film City, Kozhikode. “
Pulimurugan has become the biggest casualty. It had been running to full houses since its first show in our multiplex, but the collection has dipped by half since the removal of Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,000 notes.” However, new Tamil and Hindi films were expected to be released as per the original schedule. “Those films are almost certain to be affected, at least for the next few days,” he said. “There is the option of buying tickets online and you could also pay through debit or credit cards at the counter, but we have found most people prefer currency notes.” Technicians stop work

In Hyderabad, schedules were in disarray as the shooting of at least half-a-dozen Telugu films came to a grinding halt. Producers could not find the cash to pay the daily wages of technicians who represent 24 crafts in the industry. Among these, the biggest production now in the works is a film with actors Rakul Preet Singh and Mahesh Babu, and it is helmed by Murugadoss. This venture is being jointly-produced by the actor and director themselves. Shooting for the film was on at different parts of the twin cities. On Wednesday, technicians refused to report for shooting because their wage payments could not be made on Tuesday evening. The situation continued on Thursday. Technicians in the industry - from the light boy to those in costumes, make-up and ground staff are paid in cash every evening. Unavoidable problems

He alleged that the Bharatiya Janata Party and its allies were informed about the demonetisation move “a week in advance”. Questioning the timing of the decision, Mr. Kejriwal said it was done keeping in mind the Uttar Pradesh elections. “There is evidence that their [BJP’s] friends and own people were informed a week before the decision was announced. They have made all arrangements, like buying property or gold. The BJP is going to fight polls in Uttar Pradesh and other States. It has made all arrangements.

125,2016-11-11,4.0,HC gives demonetisation a thumbs up,"The Madras High Court Bench here on Thursday welcomed the announcement made by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday demonetising Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,000 notes and hoped that the decision would spur the nation’s economic growth by curbing corruption, storage of unaccounted wealth and circulation of fake currency notes for financing subversive activities such as drug trafficking and terrorism. Dismissing a public interest litigation petition filed by M. Seeni Ahamed, State general secretary of the Indian National League, challenging the Centre’s decision, Justices S. Nagamuthu and M.V. Muralidaran said: “It (demonetisation) is a welcome measure and any panic among the general public is unnecessary. The temporary hardship faced by people could not be a reason for this court to interfere in economic policy decisions of the State.” Beginning the judgement with a reference to the Prime Minister’s address to the nation on Tuesday, the Division Bench pointed out that the petitioner’s counsel had questioned demonetisation of the two high value currency notes on the ground that the sudden decision had caused great hardship to the common man of the country, and hence, it was in violation of the fundamental right to life guaranteed under Article 21 of the Constitution. Stating that it was not persuaded by such a “hollow” argument, the Bench recalled that the Centre had taken a similar demonetisation measure about 40 years ago by enacting the High Denomination Bank Notes (Demonetisation) Act, 1978. Then, the Constitutional validity of the Act was challenged before the Supreme Court on the ground that it was in violation of the fundamental right to property under Article 19(1)(f) of the Constitution. A Constitution Bench of the Supreme Court rejected the argument and dismissed all the petitions on August 9, 1996. “Subsequently, Article 19(1)(f) was repealed, and as of now, right to property is no more a fundamental right. When the Supreme Court had held that demonetisation does not violate the right to property even at a time when it was a fundamental right, it is difficult for us to hold now that the recent demonetisation measure violates any other fundamental right,” the judges said. On the argument advanced by the petitioner that the Centre ought to have issued prior notice and given sufficient time for the people to make alternative arrangements before demonetising the two currency notes, the judges said: “The law does not contemplate prior notice before implementing such decisions. Further, in our considered view, the object behind demonetisation itself would have been defeated if any prior notice had been issued by the Centre.” They went on to state: “Of course, there has occurred some inconvenience to the common man, but at the same time, it cannot be forgotten that people affected by stashing away of black money is the poor and middle class. Any fall in economy will have an adverse effect only on the common man. Hence, the common man has to yield to such measures for curbing anti-social activities such as corruption, storage of unaccounted wealth and use of counterfeit currency for terrorist activities.” Stating that the Centre was aware of such possible hardships and had taken various measures to ameliorate them at the earliest, the judges concurred with Assistant Solicitor General (ASG) G.R. Swaminathan that the power of judicial review could not be exercised to test the correctness of an economic policy decision taken by the government and give a finding as to whether demonetisation of the currency notes would lead to expected growth of the economy or not. They also recorded the submission of the ASG that though the denomination of a Rs. 2,000 currency note, let into circulation by the Reserve Bank of India from Thursday, had not been specified in the RBI Act, 1934, the Union Finance Ministry had notified the new denomination on Tuesday by exercising its powers under Section 24(2) of the Act.

Long queues were seen in front of banks even before they opened. The queue before the State Bank of India main branch and District Central Cooperative (DCC) Bank stretched for several metres. Some banks opened special counters for exchange of demonetised notes. However, customers and bank staff had to work through rush and pressure. A few bank branches had altercations between customers and staff. People with lesser means seemed to be the worst hit. M. Rasul Mian, who works as a messenger in a private establishment, had to buy spectacles on Wednesday. But all he had was a Rs. 500 note. “I went to three shops only to be turned down. Finally, I got spectacles after my employer asked a shop to give me a pair on credit,” he said. Vegetable vendor Anil Arke from Nagankera said his wife was worried about what to do with the money she had saved up. “We don’t have a bank account and don’t know what to do now. When we went to the bank to open an account, they asked us to come back next week,” he said. At Guru Nanak Dev Engineering college, around 100 labourers and Group ‘D’ employees refused to accept salaries that was distributed on Tuesday and Wednesday when the officers gave it in cash. Some people seemed to have benefited from the government’s move too. “A lot of our friends bought gold at a premium of Rs. 1,000- Rs. 1,200 per gram. Jewellers had a field day,” Shashi Kumar Patil Sangam, a landlord from Aurad said. Sources in the DCC bank, that has the highest number of branches in the district, said around Rs 3. crore was deposited in savings and current accounts in the bank’s branches on Thursday. Jagadish Patil, who runs a restaurant in the city, said his staff had a tough time to reason with customers. “When we opened our restaurant on Wednesday, we began giving away change to customers who bought less but paid with a higher denomination bill. But on Thursday, we were forced to ask customers to give us Rs. 100 or Rs. 50 notes, or to buy dishes for the whole of Rs. 500 or Rs. 1,000 that they were giving us,” he said. Some petrol outlets also forced customers who dished out Rs. 500 or Rs. 1,000 notes to buy fuel for the full amount.

127,2016-11-11,4.0,Demonetisation raises fears of cash distribution in Thiruparankundram,": The demonetisation of Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,000 notes has triggered apprehensions of possible distribution of more cash (of the withdrawn currency) among voters in Thiruparankundram Assembly constituency, where by-election is due on November 19. A section of politicians, especially those belonging to smaller parties, fear that candidates of bigger parties might seek to dispose of the demonetised currency to a section of voters. BJP candidate R. Srinivasan claimed that some candidates of larger parties have already started distributing money to voters in certain areas. “If the illegitimate money, which they possess, cannot be exchanged by party men, they will definitely try to distribute more money to voters in Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,000 denominations in a bid to secure victory,” he said. D. Siva Muthukumar, Madurai urban district unit secretary of DMDK, claimed that certain corrupt candidates could be exploiting the poor by distributing more cash and asking them to exchange it for legal tender in banks. “The poor, who are already used to waiting in long queues like in ration shops, will now have to queue up before banks,” he claimed. M. Thiagarajan, a resident of Thiruparankundram town, claimed that candidates of two parties had already distributed money once in his neighbourhood. “With the ban on Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,000 currencies, there is a strong rumour now that there will be another round of distribution,” he said. Mr. Srinivasan demanded that the volume of currency exchanges and deposits in banks located in the constituency should be monitored by election officials. He added that the bank accounts of those in Thiruparankundram should also be monitored, as majority of the people, even from rural areas, have bank accounts now to receive MGNREGS (Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme) wages and other subsidies. “Monitoring of the volume of transactions now and post-election is likely to show sudden spike,” he said. L. Mahadevan, candidate of Naam Tamilar Katchi, demanded deployment of additional monitoring teams in the constituency to control cash distribution. Acknowledging the risk of the demonetised currency being distributed, Madurai Collector and District Election Officer K. Veera Raghava Rao said that the poll surveillance teams already on the field have been asked to maintain strict vigil. “Central armed forces have also joined now. We are monitoring the situation continuously. If needed, additional teams will be deployed in consultation with observers, ” he said. Speaking to The Hindu, General Observer for Thiruparankundram constituency U.V. Jose said that the issue was discussed in detail with all senior election officials and police officers in the district. “So far, we have not received any direct complaints.

Some people seemed to have benefited from the government’s move too. “A lot of our friends bought gold at a premium of Rs. 1,000- Rs. 1,200 per gram. Jewellers had a field day,” Shashi Kumar Patil Sangam, a landlord from Aurad said. Sources in the DCC bank, that has the highest number of branches in the district, said around Rs 3. crore was deposited in savings and current accounts in the bank’s branches on Thursday. Jagadish Patil, who runs a restaurant in the city, said his staff had a tough time to reason with customers. “When we opened our restaurant on Wednesday, we began giving away change to customers who bought less but paid with a higher denomination bill. But on Thursday, we were forced to ask customers to give us Rs. 100 or Rs. 50 notes, or to buy dishes for the whole of Rs. 500 or Rs. 1,000 that they were giving us,” he said. Some petrol outlets also forced customers who dished out Rs. 500 or Rs. 1,000 notes to buy fuel for the full amount.

In a statement on Thursday, he said the government should make it easier for people to exchange the now-demonetised Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,000 currency notes without imposing conditions. “About 2.87 crore people in India file Income Tax returns every year. Out of this, 1.62 crore people do not pay tax as they are below the threshold limit. So, only about 1.25 crore people pay income tax,” he said. Pointing out that only about one per cent of the total population in the country pays income tax, the TNCC president said that if the announcement and procedures were aimed at making it compulsory to bring them under the tax purview, there is no greater inconvenience than the present arrangements. “The government should ensure that the poor people in this country are able to exchange whatever little money they possess easily without putting them through the trouble of asking for documents or conditions,” he added.

  While commercial banks across the district were teaming with people since early morning on Thursday to exchange the demonitised Rs.500 and Rs.1,000 notes, the service cooperative banks here wore a deserted look for want of requisite currencies. “We could manage to pool only Rs.9 lakh from the State Bank of India in Rs.100 and lower denominations and the sum was hardly sufficient to meet customer demands. Quite a few customers who approached us to withdraw up to Rs.2 lakh for marriage expenses returned disappointed as we did not have adequate currency stock,” a senior official at the Kottachery Service Cooperative Bank at Kanhangad told The Hindu . The district cooperative banks had not been provided with the new Rs.2,000 and Rs.500 denomination currencies though the nationalised and scheduled banks were given the notes, he said. Directive The State government had advised the cooperative banks not to accept the demonitised currency and the business went down once the cash stock got exhausted, he said. Serpentine queues could be witnessed in other banks across the district. The situation was expected to return to normality in a few days once the Automatic Teller Machines (ATMs) resumed functioning, a senior State Bank of India official in Kanhangad said, adding that customers could deposit the demonitised cash with relevant supporting documents in their bank accounts.

140,2016-11-11,4.0,Demonetisation raises fears of more cash distribution,": The demonetisation of Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,000 notes has triggered apprehensions of possible distribution of more cash (of the withdrawn currency) among voters in Thiruparankundram Assembly constituency, where by-election is due on November 19. A section of politicians, especially those belonging to smaller parties, fear that candidates of bigger parties might seek to dispose of the demonetised currency to a section of voters. BJP candidate R. Srinivasan claimed that some candidates of larger parties have already started distributing money to voters in certain areas. “If the illegitimate money, which they possess, cannot be exchanged by party men, they will definitely try to distribute more money to voters in Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,000 denominations in a bid to secure victory,” he said. D. Siva Muthukumar, Madurai urban district unit secretary of DMDK, claimed that certain corrupt candidates could be exploiting the poor by distributing more cash and asking them to exchange it for legal tender in banks. “The poor, who are already used to waiting in long queues like in ration shops, will now have to queue up before banks,” he claimed. M. Thiagarajan, a resident of Thiruparankundram town, claimed that candidates of two parties had already distributed money once in his neighbourhood. “With the ban on Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,000 currencies, there is a strong rumour now that there will be another round of distribution,” he said. Mr. Srinivasan demanded that the volume of currency exchanges and deposits in banks located in the constituency should be monitored by election officials. He added that the bank accounts of those in Thiruparankundram should also be monitored, as majority of the people, even from rural areas, have bank accounts now to receive MGNREGS (Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme) wages and other subsidies. “Monitoring of the volume of transactions now and post-election is likely to show sudden spike,” he said. L. Mahadevan, candidate of Naam Tamilar Katchi, demanded deployment of additional monitoring teams in the constituency to control cash distribution. Acknowledging the risk of the demonetised currency being distributed, Madurai Collector and District Election Officer K. Veera Raghava Rao said that the poll surveillance teams already on the field have been asked to maintain strict vigil. “Central armed forces have also joined now. We are monitoring the situation continuously. If needed, additional teams will be deployed in consultation with observers, ” he said. Speaking to The Hindu , General Observer for Thiruparankundram constituency U.V. Jose said that the issue was discussed in detail with all senior election officials and police officers in the district. “So far, we have not received any direct complaints. We have the cushion to deploy additional teams for surveillance if the situation warrants,” he said.

If this is what is being done with educated folks, I can very well imagine what it is like in the hinterlands,” this is what Rakesh Reddy Dubbudu posted on social media, triggering collective disapproval by people who had similar experiences at various banks. Not one to keep quiet, Mr Reddy, who runs a public information portal, has taken the complaint to Reserve Bank of India. In the evening, Mr. Reddy succeeded in forcing the bank to tear off notices that demanded address proof in addition to the RBI norm of ID proof.

Conspiracy theories abounded about the why and how of the demonetisation scheme. One of the theories listed raised Liberalised Remittances Scheme (currently $2,50,000) as a possible plot to siphon off black money to foreign shores. While another showed a screen shot of Income Tax Department showing a new tab: Accounts with Cash Transactions. Both of which incidentally are true. The LRS limit was raised to $1,25,000 on May 26, 2014; 10 days after the BJP government swept to power at the Centre. “The tab on IT for accounts with high value cash transactions is a recent one,” informed R.

142,2016-11-11,4.0,Rs.37 crore in fake currency notes seized in 5 years,"Delhi Police officers have said that the government’s move to declare Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,000 notes as illegal tender will help curb circulation of Fake Indian Currency Notes (FICN). The officials said that the nearly Rs. 37 crore worth of counterfeit currency they have recovered over the past five years is just the tip of the iceberg. A senior police officer, who has been a part of both the units dealing with FICN -- Special Cell and Crime Branch, said that the move will also choke terror funding as the money is pumped from Pakistan through various routes in fake currency of denominations, primarily of Rs.500 and Rs.1,000. Rs.5 notes While 55,785 notes of Rs. 1,000 were seized in 2012, the corresponding number for Rs. 500 notes was 1,26,822. Surprisingly, denominations as low as Rs. 5 are also printed. As recently as last year, 11,000 counterfeit five rupee notes were recovered by the police. Terror fund The officer said that the now repealed Prevention of Terrorism Act, 2002 (POTA) had stricter punishment for funding terror, but while that applied to individuals, the latest move has meant that the jugular vein has been cut. Also, the cases unearthed so far have pointed to mass-scale printing of notes across the border with millions invested in printing costs. He said that the sleeper cells also store cash in the same denominations and with one stroke, all those notes were made redundant.

143,2016-11-11,4.0,Fate of currency seized by ACB hangs in balance,"Everyone is rushing to banks to deposit or exchange demonetised currency notes of Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,000 denominations. One Government wing, despite knowing that the currency notes would go waste if not changed now or in next few weeks, is unable to make any move. That is the strange situation of Anti-Corruption Bureau — the only State agency feared by corrupt government employees — has landed in following the Centre’s ban on currency notes of these two denominations. In the past several years, the ACB had seized crores of rupees after catching government employees red-handed in trap cases. Officials are not sure of the exact amount seized in all the trap cases registered so far but estimate it could be several crores of rupees. Cash is seized by ACB officials in two types of cases. After gathering ‘prima facie’ evidence that a government employee had amassed wealth illegally, they conduct raids and seize cash and other valuables. This cash is deposited in the banks and in safe custody of bankers. But they are not sure what will happen to the money seized in trap cases. They believe, in all likelihood, this money estimated to be several crores of rupees would go waste. When a Government employee demands bribe, the sum is paid to him by the complainant. Within seconds or minutes of the person handing over the bribe sum, the ACB officials -already lying in wait- would turn up and catch the accused. “In trap cases, these currency notes become clinching evidence to prove the employee is guilty. Number of each and every note is noted before being handed over to the employee,” an ACB officer explained. The investigators deposit the same as material evidence in the court. “The bribe sum varies from case to case. In some cases, it is a few hundred but in some instances employees were caught while accepting more than a lakh of rupees,” the ACB officials said. Officials are exploring options to get the banned currency exchanged in compliance with legal formalities.

144,2016-11-11,4.0,HC gives demonetisation a thumbs up,"The Madras High Court Bench here on Thursday welcomed the announcement made by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday demonetising Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,000 notes and hoped that the decision would spur the nation’s economic growth by curbing corruption, storage of unaccounted wealth and circulation of fake currency notes for financing subversive activities such as drug trafficking and terrorism. Dismissing a public interest litigation petition filed by M. Seeni Ahamed, State general secretary of the Indian National League, challenging the Centre’s decision, Justices S. Nagamuthu and M.V. Muralidaran said: “It (demonetisation) is a welcome measure and any panic among the general public is unnecessary. The temporary hardship faced by people could not be a reason for this court to interfere in economic policy decisions of the State.” Beginning the judgement with a reference to the Prime Minister’s address to the nation on Tuesday, the Division Bench pointed out that the petitioner’s counsel had questioned demonetisation of the two high value currency notes on the ground that the sudden decision had caused great hardship to the common man of the country, and hence, it was in violation of the fundamental right to life guaranteed under Article 21 of the Constitution. Stating that it was not persuaded by such a “hollow” argument, the Bench recalled that the Centre had taken a similar demonetisation measure about 40 years ago by enacting the High Denomination Bank Notes (Demonetisation) Act, 1978. Then, the Constitutional validity of the Act was challenged before the Supreme Court on the ground that it was in violation of the fundamental right to property under Article 19(1)(f) of the Constitution. A Constitution Bench of the Supreme Court rejected the argument and dismissed all the petitions on August 9, 1996. “Subsequently, Article 19(1)(f) was repealed, and as of now, right to property is no more a fundamental right. When the Supreme Court had held that demonetisation does not violate the right to property even at a time when it was a fundamental right, it is difficult for us to hold now that the recent demonetisation measure violates any other fundamental right,” the judges said. ‘Notice not possible’ On the argument advanced by the petitioner that the Centre ought to have issued prior notice and given sufficient time for the people to make alternative arrangements before demonetising the two currency notes, the judges said: “The law does not contemplate prior notice before implementing such decisions. Further, in our considered view, the object behind demonetisation itself would have been defeated if any prior notice had been issued by the Centre.” They went on to state: “Of course, there has occurred some inconvenience to the common man, but at the same time, it cannot be forgotten that people affected by stashing away of black money is the poor and middle class. Any fall in economy will have an adverse effect only on the common man. Hence, the common man has to yield to such measures for curbing anti-social activities such as corruption, storage of unaccounted wealth and use of counterfeit currency for terrorist activities.” Stating that the Centre was aware of such possible hardships and had taken various measures to ameliorate them at the earliest, the judges concurred with Assistant Solicitor General (ASG) G.R. Swaminathan that the power of judicial review could not be exercised to test the correctness of an economic policy decision taken by the government and give a finding as to whether demonetisation of the currency notes would lead to expected growth of the economy or not. They also recorded the submission of the ASG that though the denomination of a Rs. 2,000 currency note, let into circulation by the Reserve Bank of India from Thursday, had not been specified in the RBI Act, 1934, the Union Finance Ministry had notified the new denomination on Tuesday by exercising its powers under Section 24(2) of the Act.

145,2016-11-11,4.0,"DRI to watch all incoming, outgoing foreign currency","Acting on intelligence, the Directorate of Revenue Intelligence (DRI) is keeping a close vigil on all incoming and outgoing foreign currency. The move is linked to the demonetisation of the Rs.500 and Rs.1,000 currency notes by the Centre on November 8, said sources. A DRI source revealed that individuals who hoard unaccounted cash might try to smuggle it out through the foreign currency route in the coming days. “That is our hunch right now, as the demonetisation might see more foreign currency coming in or going out. While foreign currency is not a problem as such, but there is a possibility that unaccounted cash can be changed through it for a premium,” added the source. The DRI source pointed out that people who hoard unaccounted cash cannot deposit huge sums in banks, as it will immediately rouse the Income Tax Department’s suspicion. The DRI officials are currently monitoring all ports, airports, seaports and and cargo container depots to keep a tab on incoming and outgoing foreign currency, said the source. A DRI official also said that demonetisation of the Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,000 currency notes has also dealt a huge blow to the fake currency cartels. “People with fake currency notes have no option but to destroy them. The only other option is to go to a bank for deposit, where it can easily be found out that the notes are fake,” he added. The official also informed that the circulation of fake currency had become a serious problem, as some of them were of ‘high-quality’, meaning that they could match about 8 to 9 of the security features out of 12 in comparison with genuine notes. “With fake notes gone, we are keeping a check on foreign currency.

147,2016-11-12,5.0,Demonetisation woes: Long wait breeds frustration among commoners,"Long wait: People waiting in a queue to deposit and withdraw currency notes at a bank in Hyderabad on Saturday.   HYDERABAD: Four days of trying time scurrying for cash and standing in long queues before the banks and ATM machines has been enough to swing the people’s mood from that of hope and admiration for the decision to demonetise Rs.1,000 and Rs.500 notes to that of distrust and cynicism. Those standing in the serpentine queues before the banks and ATM machines for hours to exchange or deposit their invalid notes in the bank or draw cash gave vent to their frustration that the government should have been more thoughtful about the disruption it would cause to lives of common people. “Why are the commoners and middle class getting harassed when they wanted to draw or exchange their own money,” asked a working woman who could finally draw cash after repeated attempts on Saturday in Narayanaguda. Ashok, a driver who has to perform his son’s marriage in a few days, is a worried man because of the cash crunch and the banks would not give more than Rs.4,000 in exchange and the ATMs more than Rs.2,000, if he is lucky to get his turn before the cash runs out. Rajyalakshmi, a senior citizen with indifferent health, was fortunate as a public sector bank in the Jubilee Hills was thoughtful enough to give priority to senior citizens. But her worry is about the repeat trips she has to make to the bank as Rs.4,000 will not last long as she has to pay her domestic bills and purchase medicines. Interestingly, some public sector banks got deposits into the Jan Dhan accounts of the poor in the last four days. The word is that those with unaccounted money are parking their money in these accounts by giving a nominal commission to the account holder. A bank officer admitted they received deposits into couple of such accounts. “We accepted the deposit by following the norms of Know Your Customer. If a third party came, we accept the deposit by taking an authorisation from the account holder,” he said. Meanwhile, despite the banks working long hours and even on Saturday, there is no let up as yet for the people’s woes due to short supply of currency notes. A bank manager in Khajaguda said that they had to load the ATM with Rs.100 notes three or four times. The cash had to be arranged and loaded while people in the queue had to wait. “We disbursed Rs.13 lakh on Friday,” he said. However, in some private bank ATMs, the rush has eased to some extent.

148,2016-11-12,5.0,"Demonetization, a massive scam: AAP","In the name of demonitization to fight black money, a massive scam is being played out in the country, by the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government at the Centre, said Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) here on Saturday. In Goa, politicians have parked their black money in large-scale real estate investments in recent weeks and months. With advance information of the move, the politicians have transferred the black money burden onto the unsuspecting property owners who sold their land holdings, said AAP convenor in Goa, Valmiki Naik, and demanded a thorough investigation into all recent land deals registered in the last two months in Goa. “Ordinary people are facing the hardships while the real culprits, the black money hoarders and influential quarters linked to the political powers have managed to stash their cash”, charged Goa AAP convenor Valmiki Naik here on Saturday. Reitertaing AAP’s consistent support of any move against corruption and black money in the country, AAP spokesperson Ashley de Rosario said , “ But the manner in which the Modi government has implemented the demonitization scheme, it reeks of a scam and has only ended up burdening the common folks with the financial chaos witnessed across the country.” The AAP leaders said that their national Convenor and Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal has revealed that deposits of thousands of crores of rupees in the last three months have shown a sharp rise raising questions and suspicion about the Modi government's intentions. Deposits suddenly spiked in the last three months, which raises more questions and suspicion about the Centre’s move, they quoted Kejriwal as saying. The AAP leaders lamented that the honest and hardworking citizen has become the victim facing unbearable difficulties with the financial system in disarray. “Access to your own hard-earned money has become burdensome,” said Mr. Naik and lamented that while the common man is queuing up at banks and ATMs, the crony-capitalists are unaffected by the chaos in the country’s financial system.

The MCC had launched a special tax collection drive to collect water bills worth Rs. 130 crore, but the response was not encouraging. When the MCC announced that it would accept the banned Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,000 notes towards the payment of water bills and property tax, people made use of the opportunity and cleared their dues. Mayor B.L. Bhyrappa told The Hindu that the MCC received Rs. 90 lakh towards water dues since Friday. A sum of Rs. 1 crore was collected in the form of property tax in one day. “We will work on Sunday till 6.30 p.m. and on Monday too. Taxpayers can make use of the facility,” he said. A staff at the MCC counter said: “Many are coming to clear their water dues using the banned notes. This is revenue for us.” Similar scenes were seen at the bill collection counters of Chamundeshwari Electricity Supply Corporation since provision had been made for paying electricity bills. Queues outside the counters were long and most people paid using the banned notes.

150,2016-11-12,5.0,Banks keep an eye out for illegal currency exchange,"KOCHI: Suspecting unscrupulous elements of engaging carriers, mostly migrant labourers, to get their unaccounted money exchanged, banks are working to make their systems foolproof to ensure that no same person makes successive exchanges. According to the latest Reserve Bank of India (RBI) notification, a person can exchange Rs.4,000 worth Old High Denomination (OHD) currency notes over bank counters once in 15 days. However, senior bank officials told The Hindu that instances where the same individuals turning up successively for exchange using different ID proof documents had come to their notice. They were turned away without cash, but they might have succeeded at other branches. Sensing a possible fraud in the making, banks are working on a system to alert to multiple exchanges by the same persons. Officials also warned of a possibility of such illegal exchange of unaccounted money through the shops and firms doing brisk business. There were reports of a woman lottery vendor near Marine Drive being approached by some men who offered her commission for exchanging currency on their behalf. Besides, some banks had received fake currency notes though their number was negligible. “We are destroying such notes rather than turning those responsible over to the police since it is possible that they might have landed those one-off fake notes accidentally,” a bank official said. Meanwhile, the police said it was for banks to have a system to flag such illegal exchanges. “Migrant workers without bank accounts and have saved their salaries over several months might try to get them exchanged through Rs.4,000 lots, and they cannot be put under scanner for possessing cash. What the police can do is verify cases referred by banks,” Deputy Commissioner of Police Arul R.B. Krishna said. As such there is already enough confusion, and the police do not want to add to the confusion by interfering in monetary transactions. The police are also keeping track of bulk movement of cash, he added. “Our role is restricted to maintaining law and order for which we have deployed additional men near ATMs and banks. We have intensified patrolling and have even put up a picket in front of the RBI,” Mr. Krishna said.

151,2016-11-12,5.0,Demonetisation woes continue,"KURNOOL: Demonetisation woes continued unabated on Saturday with people thronging banks to exchange Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,000 notes which ceased to be legal tender and get Rs. 100 notes to meet their daily expenses. While ATMs of SBH, Indian Bank, Axis Bank and Corporation Bank remaining closed, people stood in long queues before the ATMs of other banks to withdraw cash of Rs. 2,000. Several ATMs were open, but ran out of cash, and the card-holders returned dejected. Customers who made withdrawal at Kotak Mahindra Bank branches were given Rs. 2,000 note each, as the bank had no currency of other denominations. Those exchanging Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,000 notes got two Rs. 2,000 notes. Similar was the scene in Kurnool head post-office. The scene was different in Andhra Bank branches, where people exchanging the banned notes for Rs. 4,000 were given two bundles of Rs. 20 notes, as the bank ran out of Rs. 100 notes. However, account holders withdrawing cash from ICICI Bank were given three notes of Rs. 2,000 and 40 notes of Rs. 100. Petrol pumps accepted Rs. 500 notes on the condition that they would fill petrol worth the amount. Electricity bill counters accepted Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,000 notes, but gave receipts for the amount, promising adjustment of the change in the next bill, as they lacked adequate change. Doctors refused to accept the banned currency. They refused to discharge a patient until the hospital bill was paid in the new currency and Rs. 100 notes, a patient said. Police organised bandobust at the commercial banks in view of the heavy rush of depositors, which left the bank officials and personnel glued to their seats. BJP district president G. Harish Babu and activists went round several banks to guage the situation on account of demonetisation.

  HYDERABAD: Union Minister for Urban Development M.Venkaiah Naidu justified the demonetisation move by the Prime Minister Narendra Modi as the mantra to galvanise the economy, reduce inflation, moderate real estate prices, increase the GDP and attract investments. The decision has multifarious advantages, and has been hailed by the IMF and Goldman Sachs as a great measure, he claimed, and assured that it will bring funds for the welfare schemes for the poor. Refuting the criticism that the Prime Minister had done nothing to bring back the black money stashed away in overseas banks, Mr.Naidu, at a talk organised by the city BJP here on Saturday, said a special investigative team has been constituted to look into the overseas black money issue, and the ‘Undisclosed foreign income and assets (imposition of tax) Act’ has been brought in. Collaboration with other nations for automatic exchange of information with regard to Panama accounts, tax information agreement signed with the USA, and agreements with tax havens such as Switzerland, Cyprus and Mauritius to avoid double taxation were aimed at curbing the black money parked abroad, Mr.Naidu said. This move has also put paid to the “conspiracy by Pakistan” to circulate counterfeit currency and promote terrorism. Smugglers, drug traffickers, child traffickers, and terrorists who have been trying to destabilise India by running parallel economy will be the sufferers now, Mr.Naidu claimed. “Though some people are visiting ATMs for photo-ops, I have received positive feedback from people who are willing to take the trouble for the country’s sake,” he said taking an indirect dig at Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi. After temporary setbacks, a stronger economy will emerge, he said.

In an exclusive interview to The Hindu here on Saturday on the fallout of the withdrawal of Rs.500 and Rs.1,000 notes as legal tender by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Mr. Choudhury, who heads operations in AP, said increased use of debit and credit cards and digital wallets would raise the number of bank account holders and help fill the coffers of the government. “The more important aspect is putting a full-stop to funding the terror networks and huge amount of fake notes being circulated by the terrorists and anti-national forces into the market. The bold move will certainly help the economy manifold,” he said. Mr. Choudhury said their intention was not to conduct raids as it was an ultimate option. “The government’s focus is to increase tax compliance rate and make all transactions transparent. The fallout of demonetisation will be safeguarding the interest of the nation and facilitate extra revenue collections.” He expressed satisfaction over the response to the Income Disclosure Scheme (IDS)-2016 in which a disclosure of Rs.13,000 crore was made in Andhra Pradesh and Telangana out of Rs.65,000 crore disclosed pan India. The tax on the disclosed amount as notified earlier would be collected by September, 2017. The Chief Commissioner said besides educating the public on tax compliance, they would also continue keeping a tab on unaccounted assets and transactions by taking videos of lavish spending at marriages and other social functions. He said search and seizure operations were being undertaken based on inputs received by the department through various sources including social media. He said as far as the Income Tax Region in Visakhapatnam was concerned, the collections as on November 10 was Rs .1900 crore compared to Rs.1471 crore last year. On complaints regarding delay in refunds, he said following a series of measures, they had streamlined the payment. A refund of Rs.355.40 crore was paid so far as against Rs.222.8 crore during the corresponding period in the region. Net collections registered a growth rate of 23.4 per cent against an all India percentage of 10.3 per cent.

  The Delhi Chief Minister hit out at the Central government alleging there was a huge scam behind the decision to scrap Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,000 currency notes. “In the name of tackling corruption, a scam is being carried out on a large scale. Some evidence has to come to light and TV channels are showing it. I am not saying something new,” Mr. Kejriwal told reporters at a press briefing on Saturday. “On November 8, when Prime Minister Modi announced that Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,000 notes are not legal tender any more, they had already informed all their friends and Bharatiya Janata Party people, who actually have all the black money,” Mr. Kejriwal alleged. He further alleged that holders of large amounts of black money had enough to time to take care of it, before the decision to scrap the notes was made officially. ‘Common man suffering’ “In the last three months, money has been deposited in all banks at a large scale, running into thousands of crores of rupees. This arouses suspicion,” he alleged, going on to ask, “When deposits in the quarters before that were in the negative, or there was no growth, how were such high deposits suddenly made between the July and September quarter? Whose money is this and how did such large-scale deposits happen?” “It is the common man who is suffering due to this as those who have black money have already set things up. New notes are being home-delivered to them for a commission,” he alleged. “There are huge queues outside banks. Are there any big industrialists or black marketers in the queue? No. Shopkeepers, rickshaw pullers, autorickshaw drivers, farmers and labourers are in the queue. Do they have all the black money?” he asked. Mr. Kejriwal said demonetisation has lead to a system of commissions and provided a fillip to black money instead. “Gold rate has gone up and black money has increased instead of decreasing,” he alleged.

Some evidence has to come to light and TV channels are showing it, it is not something new that I’m saying,” Mr. Kejriwal told reporters in a press briefing on Saturday. “On November 8, when Prime Minister Modi announced that Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,000 notes are not legal tenders any more, they had already informed all their friends and BJP people, who actually have all the black money,” Mr. Kejriwal alleged. He further alleged that those who large amounts of black money had got enough to time to take care of it, before the decision to scrap the notes was officially made. “In last three months, money has been deposited in all banks at a large scale, running into thousand of crores of Rupees. This arouses suspicion,” he alleged. “When the deposits in quarters before that were in the negative or there was no growth, how did suddenly such high deposits where made between July and September quarter? Whose money is this and how did such large scale deposits happen?” he said. “It is the common man who is suffering due to this as those who have black money, have already done the setting. New notes are being home delivered to them for a commission,” he alleged. “There are huge queues outside banks, are there any big industrialists or black marketers in the queue? No. Shopkeepers, rickshaw pullers, auto rickshaw driver, farmers and labourers are in the queue. Do they have all the black money?” he said. Mr. Kejriwal alleged that demonetisation has led to a system of commissions and provided a fillip to black money instead. “Gold rate have gone up and black money has gone up instead of decreasing,” he alleged. “If the government had completely scrapped Rs. 1,000 and Rs. 500 notes, we would have supported you,” he said. Mr. Kejriwal said that by introducing Rs. 2,000 notes, black money problem would not be taken care of. “People are unhappy and poor people have to pay commission to convert their hard earned savings,” he said. “There is going to be a 200 per cent penalty on deposits above Rs. 2.5 lakh. You will take penalty from poor people who have saved Rs.. 5 to Rs. 6 lakhs over 10 years for their daughter’s wedding? God will not spare you,” he said. Mr. Kejriwal also alleged that the real black money is in Swiss bank accounts, which Mr. Narendra Modi had promised to bring back before becoming Prime Minister but have not done anything on this issue since then. He said that he has those account numbers and if the government wants to take action against black money, they should arrest these account holders immediately.

While the funeral of Bela Devi in Meerut had to be cancelled, a fight over the queue position outside an ATM in Muzaffarnagar led to firing and ruckus. Bela Devi died on Thursday night. Her funeral was scheduled for Friday but her family had to cancel it after realising that they did not have enough cash to perform the rituals. Instead, the entire family was standing in a queue at the local branch of ICICI Bank to withdraw money. “We had no option but to postpone her funeral on Friday and go to the bank instead. What to do, it is an emergency,” Bela Devi's son Santosh told the media. Several children in Agra broke their piggy banks after their parents sought small change from them.

163,2016-11-12,5.0,"Hit by demonetisation, coin show postponed",": Demonetisation of Rs. 1,000 and Rs. 500 notes has led to the postponement of a coin and note show that was scheduled to begin on Friday. The show, which was to be held at the All India Fine Arts & Crafts Society, “had to be postponed as the participants — be it exhibitors, dealers buyers or enthusiasts— have no small currency for travel and accommodation”, said organiser Mukesh Verma, a numismatist and dealer himself. The seven-day exhibition will now be held in April 2017. Visitors at the show can buy, sell or exchange old coins, notes and stamps. Mr. Verma says due to their large numbers, the future of these notes as collectibles “on their own is bleak unless they are of some special series, or are error notes or have extra paper, etc”. “In 1978, when the Rs. 10,000 and Rs.5,000 notes were scrapped, they were collectibles on their own due to their few numbers. But the Rs .1,000 and Rs.500 notes are in huge numbers; they are not rare,” says Mr. Verma. Mahesh Kalra, the regional secretary of the South Asian Oriental Numismatic Society, says, “Demonetised money does not always become collectibles. The Rs. 1,000 and Rs. 500 notes might be of some interest 10 years from now.” Manik Jain, the author of Phila India Guide book, says “The collection of these notes will have more sentimental than commercial value. You may collect Rs. 500 notes with your birth date, etc. But that’s about it.” Printable version | Jan 7, 2017 1:12:40 AM | http://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/Hit-by-demonetisation-coin-show-postponed/article16337829.ece © The Hindu The Hindu revisits the gruesome December 2012 gang-rape to examine if Delhi is any safer for the average woman today"
164,2016-11-12,5.0,"Demonetisation could cut inflation, says Panagariya","The Centre’s demonetisation drive will help lower inflation, NITI Aayog vice chairman Arvind Panagariya said on Friday. “All these makes me believe that their could be some moderation in inflation in the short-term,” Mr. Panagariya said at the Economic Editors’ Conference. “Yields on sovereign bonds softened after the government announced that the present Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,000 currency notes will not be a legal tender from November 9.” He also said that eradication of black money from circulation will have some impact on money supply. “As the black money goes out of the system, the money supply will shrink to some degree. This will reduce the inflation rate in the absence of any open market operations by the RBI,” Mr. Panagariya said. Banks will see healthy growth in savings account deposits due to this exercise, he said. “Savings that were kept in different forms particularly in the form of currency notes, they will now move into bank deposits. So we will see some surge in bank deposits,” Mr. Panagariya added. Separately, Bibek Debroy, member of NITI Aayog dismissed that the demonetisation will have any impact on economic growth. “Real estate prices were already impacted due to several measures that government had taken in the past,” Mr. Debroy said. He said black money was never in the calculation of GDP figures, hence the present demonetisation drive will not impact growth.

In a statement, the party state secretary G. Ramakrishnan pointed out various drawbacks related to the follow-up to the Prime Minister’s announcement. He said that the government has taken no steps to ensure the adequate supply of the new Rs. 500 and Rs 2,000 currency notes, leading to a disruption of trade.

Andhra Bank personnel, who are authorised to sell the Rs. 500 VIP break darshan tickets on behalf of the TTD, on Friday stoutly rejected the scrapped denomination currency notes and urged the pilgrims either to use the swipe machines or tender Rs.100 notes for the purchase of the darshan tickets. When contacted by The Hindu, the local Andhra Bank manager V. Subramanyam said: “ ab initio we had to heed to the request of the TTD of not subjecting the visiting pilgrims to hardships though the existing guidelines did not permit us. The initial days also saw a run for lower denomination currency notes. It remains a fact that the pilgrims who had embarked on the pilgrimage on Tuesday were totally unaware of the centre's move. But what is stopping the pilgrims in compiling with the centre's decision when all the banks in the country have been made equipped with new currency notes since Thursday. For the benefit of the devotees we have also opened up additional counters outside the bank premises for the exchange of the scrapped currency notes he added. When such is the fact how can we honour the demonetised currency notes?” Meanwhile the sales at the TTD s publication stall where the management had made the new year calendars and diaries was also severely hit. Scores of devotees returned disheartened owing to the refusal of scrapped notes by the staff. Pilgrims seeking accommodation were seen either tendering lower denomination notes or using the swipe cards.

State Health Minister Deepak Sawant had issued a clear directive that both government and private hospitals will have to accept old currency notes from patients. According to Bhiwandi resident Ratilal Shah, he had admitted his son Mitesh for a kidney-related ailment to Fortis Hospital, Kalyan. However, staff at the hospital refused to take redundant currency when he attempted to pay the bill, amounting to Rs. 1,70,118. On Thursday, Mr. Shah lodged a complaint with the Thane District Collector. Mr. Kalyankar instructed Sub-Divisional Officer Prasad Ukarde and other revenue officials to visit the hospital and help the Shah family. The officials met the hospital director, who reassured them that there will be no further harassment of the patient. However, when similar complaints were received that the hospital was continuing to refuse demonetised the currencies, the collector issued a notice under the provisions of the Bombay Nursing Home Registration Act, 1949 and IPC section 188 (disobedience to order duly promulgated by public servant). The hospital has been asked to provide a written explanation by November 12. The Thane Collectorate has also set up a helpdesk under the supervision of District Civil Surgeon Dr. Kemphi Patil and Sub-Divisional Officer Sudam Pardeshi to ensure that patients do not suffer inconvenience due to demonetisation.

169,2016-11-12,5.0,Demonetisation cripples treasury functioning,"As demonetisation cripples the functioning of treasuries across the State, the government is reportedly groping in the dark to find out options for resuming financial transactions at the earliest. Finance Department sources told The Hindu here on Friday that treasuries were forced to make pension and other payments from their imprest fund provided by banks to meet their urgent needs. Payments of bills Payments of bills for all civil works executed by government agencies, Plan projects of local bodies and such others have been suspended due to funds crunch. Treasury personnel are a confused lot as they have not been authorised to collect currency that is not legal tender. Though Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan and Finance Minister T.M. Thomas Isaac had written separate letters to Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Union Finance Minister Arun Jaitley seeking urgent intervention to the impasse in treasuries, it had not elicited any response, sources said. Local bodies as well as Revenue Department offices that collect property and land tax are finding the going tough for want of specific directions. But the Finance Department has directed Revenue and other government departments to collect taxes, be it Rs.1,000 or Rs.500 denominations. Urban and rural local bodies are unwilling to accept Rs.1,000 and Rs.500 notes. This has taken a heavy toll on their own fund, that is mainly derived from property and other taxes, sources said. Treasury being the fulcrum of the financial transactions of the government and other allied agencies, unless the Centre responds to the request for intervention and offer a solution, the crisis will worsen in the coming days. The Centre should essentially clarify whether the treasuries could accept the Rs.1,000 and Rs.500 notes and also continue transactions as usual, or it would further worsen the crisis, sources said. Lottery draws suspended Draw of Kerala Lottery would remain suspended for the next two days too. The daily collection from the sale of lottery tickets has dipped from Rs.28 crore to Rs.8 crore. The government would have to review the situation before resuming the draw. An 80 per cent dip has been reported in the daily collection of the agents attached to the Kerala State Financial Enterprises. This is likely to diminish further, sources said.

  All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam leader P. Kannan has hailed the decision of Prime Minister Narendra Modi to withdraw Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,000 currency notes. Terming the decision “very bold and a historic step towards curbing corruption,” he said all political parties should support the move so that the menace of black money would come to an end. “I fully support the Prime Minister in my personal capacity. No other Prime Minister has taken such a bold decision in Independent India. In the beginning, there will be some inconvenience to the people but in the long run it will help strengthen the country,” he said in a statement. Mr. Kannan, who unsuccessfully contested the Assembly election on AIADMK ticket after quitting the Congress, had been keeping a low profile after the electoral débâcle. The former Congress leader had not been seen on the campaign trail in Nellithope where AIADMK candidate Om Sakthi Sekar is pitted against Chief Minister V.

As the crisis continued for the second day on Friday in the island after Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced that the two high-denomination currency notes ceased to be legal tender, the boat owners could not mobilise money for purchasing the essential items for fishing and decided to abstain from fishing.

If this is what is being done with educated folks, I can very well imagine what it is like in the hinterlands,” this is what Rakesh Reddy Dubbudu posted on social media, triggering collective disapproval by people who had similar experiences at various banks. Not one to keep quiet, Mr Reddy, who runs a public information portal, has taken the complaint to Reserve Bank of India. In the evening, Mr. Reddy succeeded in forcing the bank to tear off notices that demanded address proof in addition to the RBI norm of ID proof.

Conspiracy theories Conspiracy theories abounded about the why and how of the demonetisation scheme. One of the theories listed raised Liberalised Remittances Scheme (currently $2,50,000) as a possible plot to siphon off black money to foreign shores. While another showed a screen shot of Income Tax Department showing a new tab: Accounts with Cash Transactions. Both of which incidentally are true.

Many faced difficulties in withdrawing cash from their bank accounts and from ATM kiosks. People had to wait in long queues at the branches of nationalised and private banks to avail new notes after surrendering their demonetised notes and to withdraw cash from their accounts. The delay in commencement of the functioning of ATMs added to the woes. Migrant labours working for various construction projects were the worst affected by the demonetisation. Subrata Modak and five others from West Bengal, working as masons for a project of construction of a multi-storied building, were standing in a queue before a nationalised bank at Mahaveer Circle. Mr. Modak said that the refusal to accept Rs. 1,000 and Rs. 500 notes at hotels and grocery shops on Wednesday and Thursday created many problems for them. Some grocery shop owners refused to tender change and demanded that they make purchases for the full amount. Mr. Modak and his friends had availed leave from work on Friday and were waiting in queue to get the new notes in exchange of demonetised notes with them. Yogishwarappa, a resident of Danihalli near here, had been to the city to attend a wedding. A friend from his village, who is suffering from an auto-immune disease, requested him to bring home medicines. Mr. Yogishwarappa said he had planned to purchase the medicines by withdrawing cash using his debit card. He expressed displeasure against the delay in opening of ATM kiosks and said that the government should have intimated the people on the actual time of commencement of the service of cash withdrawal at ATM kiosks to avoid inconvenience. At many banks, there was delay in honouring cheques for withdrawal of money from accounts owing to deficit of cash. Some ATM kiosks in downtown areas, including B.H.

The ripple effect of cancellation of high value notes has been felt across the borders with huge population of Indian diaspora living in countries like the US, Canada, the UK and Dubai, among others as they suddenly found themselves holding worthless Indian currency. “Many are irked by the fact that there is no clarity yet on how they can exchange these invalid notes and where,” said Malini who got a call from her friend Anuradha living in Canada. Some of them plan to send the cash with their relatives or friends travelling to India to be exchanged before the deadline or to be deposited in banks here. But not many are comfortable with the idea either, Ms.Malini said. Many NRIs who are in similar situation made attempts to exchange the cash but there are no takers as yet for want of clarity or instructions from Indian government to their embassies and High Commissions. This according to NRI sources in Toronto, became quite an issue that found coverage in the local newspapers too. No travel plans Syamala, a US citizen, who keeps few thousands of Indian currency mostly in high value notes, to spend during her trips to India, has no clue how she can exchange the invalid notes in her possession now. “I don’t plan to travel to India at least for next eight months nor I can exchange them with foreign currency now,” she rues. The NRIs and Indians with US,UK citizenship have been calling their friends and families back home on how they could exchange the cash stuck with them as most of them do not have plans to travel to India in the near future. William, who works for a UK based MNC, travels to India on work for the company’s Indian subsidiary. He called his colleagues here to ask how he could exchange the USD 400 worth Indian currency in his possession. Sandilya, an architect who works in Dubai, said he had a few Rs.500 notes which he tried to exchange with a currency exchange firm in Dubai. But they refused to accept the cancelled Indian currency in the absence of instructions either from Indian government or the currency exchange’s head office. “Many of us have no idea what to do with the few Rs.500 and Rs.1,000 notes we have now. There is no communication for NRIs either from the Indian government or banks so far,” he said.

This included both exchange and deposits of the scrapped notes, said S. Venkataraman, chief general manager of the SBI’s Kerala circle. Though the exact figure was not available, close to Rs.500 crore worth of the scrapped notes were exchanged. “The SBI staff had the most hectic two days in their career on Thursday and Friday,” Mr. Venkataraman, who is responsible for some 500 branches in Kerala and Lakshadweep, told The Hindu . “I appreciate the fine job done by the bank staff.” He said the bank had hardly any time to get prepared for the Herculean task. He pointed out that the SBI had by far the largest volume of demonetisation-related business in Kerala. Mr. Venkataraman said that only around 230 of the SBI’s 1,434 ATMs could be made operational on Friday. On Saturday, this would rise to 400 and by Monday nearly 1,000 ATMs across the State would be able to deliver cash. The cash-loading of most of the ATMs was done by outsourced agencies. The ATMs had to be replenished frequently and the bank too had to get its stocks replenished from the RBI and from the mint. On Friday, the ATMs delivered only Rs.100 and Rs.50 notes; the delivery of Rs.2,000 could start any time soon. Mr. Venkataraman said the bank would work on Saturday and Sunday to handle the rush for exchanging the scrapped notes. He hoped the rush would taper off during the course of next week, though the demand for exchange would continue until December 30, the deadline set by the government. Staff come in for praise Mr. Venkataraman said the SBI, like other banks, was facing a shortage of small-denomination notes. Because of this, it had decided to use `reusable notes’ (old notes) to mitigate the shortage. Mr. Venkataraman said the SBI staff had cooperated very well with the management and that they would be compensated monetarily for the extra efforts they had taken.

In a statement, the party state secretary G. Ramakrishnan pointed out various drawbacks related to the follow-up to the Prime Minister’s announcement. He said that the government has taken no steps to ensure the adequate supply of the new Rs. 500 and Rs 2,000 currency notes, leading to a disruption of trade. The party called for the ending of withdrawal limits — at least, in cases where an urgent need could be proven — and said ATMs needed to be functional immediately. — Special Correspondent Printable version | Jan 7, 2017 1:13:07 AM | http://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/CPIM-flays-demonetisation/article16443094.ece © The Hindu The cyclone wreaked havoc on the city throwing normal life out of gear.

With the Central Government allowing the local agencies to accept invalidated currency notes, people thronged the municipal corporation offices to relieve themselves of the Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,000 notes to make tax payments. The tax collection crossed Rs. 5 crore by the GWMC by Sunday afternoon. It has earned a revenue of Rs 4.19 crore in the form of taxes on Saturday. sThe corporation got Rs 3.13 crore on Friday while Rs 1.06 crore were collected from public by 6 pm on Saturday. With the time being extended till November 14, the corporation is expected to collect even more and this is the first time in its history. According to the in-charge commissioner, Shahid Masood, the corporation launched special drive to collect the pending property taxes and water tap charges from people in 58 divisions. Special counters were opened in two circles and at GWMC head office in addition to the eight existing counters which have been working till late hours. Meanwhile, the corporation also pressed into service 33 bill collectors equipped with billing machines to collect taxes on a door-to-door basis. The Mee Seva centres also saw large crowds that turned up to pay their utility bills. The in-charge commissioner said they might collect around Rs 9 crore towards property tax, water tax and trade license charge. They so far collected Rs 1.56 lakh towards penalties. Mayor N Narender said they planned to collect Rs 2 crore per day and urged people to utilise the opportunity.

  Home Minister Rajnath Singh has dialled Chief Ministers of at least 10 States to monitor law and order issues being reported in the wake of the announcement made by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on November 8 to discontinue the old Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,000 notes. On November 10, two days after the announcement was made, the first number that Mr. Singh dialled was that of Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar. Only a day ago, the staunch critic of Mr. Modi had spoken in support of the demonetisation move. “The call was made by the Home Minister to extend all possible help from the Centre. Bihar Chief Minister was the first one he spoke to and after that he dialled several other Chief Ministers also,” said an official at Mr. Singh’s office. The CMs who were dialled mostly comprised the BJP-ruled States of Rajasthan, Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Jharkhand, Haryana, Assam and Goa. The other States were Andhra Pradesh, Telangana and Bihar. The official confirmed that West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee was not on the dialled list, nor was Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal. Ms. Banerjee has criticised the Centre’s move and asked it to withdraw the “hasty decision” and “first put a proper action plan in place.” Mr. Kejriwal has called the ban on Rs. 500 and 1,000 notes as the “biggest scam in recent times.” On Sunday, Mr. Singh held a meeting with Finance Minister Arun Jaitley and officials of the security establishment to analyse the security complications arising out of the cash crunch. “The main thrust of the meeting was to look for measures to reduce queues outside banks and ATMs. Another important points discussed were ways to stop rumour mongering and mischievous news that were only adding to the confusion,” said the official. The Parliament session begins this week and Mr. Singh who also heads the Cabinet Committee on Parliamentary Affairs is to meet several political leaders.

181,2016-11-13,6.0,Demonetisation hits Snehasparsam,"The scarcity of bank notes caused by demonetisation of Rs.500 and Rs.1,000 notes has had an adverse effect on the fund collection for the Snehasparsam Project of Kozhikode District Panchayat’s Kidney Patients Welfare Society, held on Sunday. Though the organisers had announced willingness to accept the nullified notes, most people were not willing to give up the notes of lower denominations, said Snehasparsam project coordinator Sreeraj N. “We had started campaigning months ago and had conducted door-to-door canvassing many times. But the demonetisation was an unexpected hurdle that we could not overcome since it came at the last moment,” he said. The fund collection was held in all the 70 panchayats in the district and the municipalities other than Ramanattukara and Vadakara on Sunday. Though there was a provision to deposit online into the Snehasparsam account, the outcome was low since online banking is not very popular in the rural areas. “Many people did not have money with them as they were either jobless or had not received payment from their employers due to scarcity of currency,” Mr. Sreeraj said. On the other hand, there were people who had set aside the sum for Snehasparsam much before the demonetisation came into effect. “The neighbourhood groups that had contributed up to Rs.27,000 last year had only collected up to Rs.7,000 this time,” he said. The organisers are expecting the financial crisis to be toned down by November 27 when the fund collection is to take place in Kozhikode Corporation, Vadagara and Ramanattukara municipalities. An executive meeting of the society to be held on Monday will discuss whether the collection in rural areas has to be extended, Mr. Sreeraj added.

182,2016-11-13,6.0,RTC suffers huge loss due to demonetisation,"VIJAYAWADA: The ban on big notes by the Centre has impacted the APSRTC which suffered a loss of more than Rs. 5 crore in the last few days. The RTC earns about Rs. 10 crore per day (The income depends on muhurtams and festivals). But it had to cancel some services due to poor Occupancy Ratio (OR), the authorities said, leading to a loss of about Rs.1 crore a day. Many passengers are postponing or cancelling their journeys due to lack of change as the conductors are insisting on exact fare and are not accepting the old Rs. 500 and Rs.1000 notes. The APSRTC, which has the largest fleet in the country, transports 65 lakh passengers over 45 lakh km by operating 12,000 buses every day. It employs 61,000 workers and runs services to Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, Odisha and Telangana. “The average OR in APSRTC is 68 per cent. But the ratio has dropped to 62 per cent and below in the last five days. On November 10, the OR was 60 per cent and on the next day it was 62 per cent and there was a drop in reservations and current bookings in many services on November 11 and 12,” said RTC Executive Director (Operations) G. Jaya Rao. The officials said they expected good revenue during the Karteeka Masam and the muhurtams. “The Corporation is operating about 650 buses to Hyderabad and about 500 buses to Tirupati from various destinations. But the OR has come down in many routes. We have not booked any Karteeka Masam packages too and the city services were badly hit,” said Corporation Chief Traffic Manager (CTM) Srinivas Brahmananda Reddy. “Due to poor OR, advance and current reservations, we are forced to cancel buses in some routes. We are making efforts to increase the OR by maintaining small notes in the ticket issuing counters and with the conductors,” Mr. Jaya Rao told The Hindu.

183,2016-11-13,6.0,"Demonetisation a masterstroke by Prime Minister, says CII","VISAKHAPATNAM: The Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) on Sunday hailed the Centre’s decision on demonetisation and said it would strike a blow at the heart of illegal economy. Describing the decision as a masterstroke by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, it said, while it was not possible to have a firm estimate of unaccounted for wealth, it was widely put at around a fifth of India’s GDP, or around $450 billion. “While some of this may be stored in cash, some may be in assets such as real estate and jewellery. This negatively affects the business environment, especially for those who comply with the law of land and follow ethical practices,” the CII said in a release. After a short period of pain, the CII expects a much stronger economy. “India’s cash dependence is extremely high with a currency-GDP ratio of around 12 per cent compared to 4-5 per cent in other developing countries. High level of cash usage tends to slow down the flow of money through the economy,” the release stated. “As we transition to a greater usage of financial technology (fintech) for payments, spending will go up, leading to additional economic growth. This is an economic masterstroke by the Prime Minister and must be allowed time to play out,” CII Director-General Chandrajit Banerjee said in the release. “The RBI will now have more room to cut interest rates as inflation subsides. Already, the bond market has reacted to the news with reduction in the bond yields,” Mr. Banerjee observed. For the industry, he said the decision was historic and hoped that it would ensure fair play for entrepreneurs, ending the role of a parallel economy.

184,2016-11-13,6.0,"Madurai Bench, first in the country to decide on demonetisation","People waiting in a long queue to exchange their devalued currencies in front of a bank in Madurai.
  Madurai: The nation is yet to recover from jitters sent by Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s surprise address to the people on Tuesday announcing demonetisation of Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,000 currency notes, but the Madurai Bench of the Madras High Court has already created history by being the first in the country to hear, deliberate and dismiss a case against the Centre’s move that has earned both bouquets and brickbats. However, what made the Madurai Bench reject the case was a decision of the Supreme Court taken on August 9, 1996 by a four-judge Bench of Justices M.K. Mukherjee, Kuldip Singh, M.M. Punchhi, and N.P. Singh upholding the Constitutional validity of the High Denomination Bank Notes (Demonetisation) Act, 1978 enacted during the Prime Ministership of Morarji Desai to demonetise Rs. 1,000, Rs. 5,000 and Rs. 10,000 currencies. Section 2 (d) of the Act defined the term ‘high denomination bank notes’ to mean the three currency notes and Section 3 declared that on expiry of January 16, 1978 all high-denomination notes shall, notwithstanding anything contained in Section 26 of the Reserve Bank of India Act 1934, ceased to be legal tender in payment or on account at any place. Section 4 of the Act prohibited transfer and receipt of the currencies from the specified date. Assailing the Act, the petitioners before the Supreme Court had contended that it violated their fundamental rights enshrined in Articles 19 (1) (f) and 31 of the Constitution. While the first Article recognised the right to acquire any property by lawful means, hold it and dispose of it freely, limited only by reasonable restrictions, the second Article provided that the State could acquire private property for a public purpose only on payment of compensation to the owner. Since Section 26 of the RBI Act cast a duty upon the bank to honour the obligation of accepting currencies issued by it as legal tender, it was contended that the Demonetisation Act extinguished the debts due from the RBI to the holders of high denomination notes and that such extinguishment of debts amounted to compulsory acquisition of property without payment of compensation which was mandatory under Article 31(2) of the Constitution. Rejecting the arguments, the apex court said the contention based on Article 19(1)(f ) was “wholly misconceived for after compulsory acquisition of their property by the impugned Act, the petitioners right thereto stood extinguished and consequently the question of reasonable restriction to the exercise or enjoyment of a right, which became non est, could not arise”. On the issue of compensating the holders of demonetised bank notes, the court said: “Equally untenable is the petitioners’ contention that they were deprived of their right to get compensation for such acquisition as Sections 7 and 8 of the Demonetisation Act lay down an elaborate procedure to apply for and obtain an equal value of the high denomination bank notes in the manner prescribed thereunder.” Taking a cue from that judgement, the Madurai Bench held: “Now Article 19(1)(f) is no more in force. Therefore, as of now, right to own property is no more a fundamental right. Similarly, Article 31 also stands supplemented by certain other provisions introduced. When the Honourable Supreme Court had declared that demonetisation of currency notes did not violate Article 19(1)(f), it is difficult for us to hold that it offends any other fundamental right.” A Division Bench of Justices S. Nagamuthu and M.V. Muralidaran also went on to state that the present petitioner who had challenged the recent decision to demonetise Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,000 notes had not made out any case, even prima facie, to show that the Finance Ministry’s notification under challenge was either illegal, irrational or it suffered from procedural impropriety or proportionality for the court to exercise judicial review. On the issue of hardship caused to the common man due to the sudden move, the judges said: “Of course, it is true that it has caused some inconvenience. As expressed by the Hon’ble Prime Minister of India, in his address to the nation, it is not as though the Government was not aware of these possible inconvenience or hardship to the common man and the poor people of this country. “His Excellency, the President of India, who himself is a great scholar, economist and who had held the portfolio of finance for a considerable time, has issued a Press Note wherein His Excellency has welcomed the said action taken by the Central Government, which, according to him, will help to unearth unaccounted money as well as counterfeit currency. “As it has been expressed by His Excellency the President of India and the Hon’ble Prime Minister of India, we, the people of this country, should be hopeful that this measure would speed up the growth of the economy.... and it would free the country from corruption, black money, terrorism and other evils,” the judges concluded.

187,2016-11-13,6.0,Demonetisation: billpayments extended,"Accusing the Central government of being insensitive to the chaos caused by the snap decision to demonetise Rs.1,000 and Rs.500 notes, the State government on Sunday stepped in to provide relief for the harrowed public, with Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan announcing an extension of the last date for payment of taxes and fees. Talking to reporters on his way to New Delhi, Mr. Vijayan said payment of utility bills such as electricity and water charges, college fees and fees levied by local bodies for various services could be paid up to November 30 without fine. The tax levied by the Motor Vehicles Department for commercial vehicles, taxis and autorickshaws would be accepted up to November 30. However, there would be no extension of the date for payment of VAT and excise duty. Coming down heavily on the Centre, Mr. Vijayan said “it is now clear that the demonetisation move was not aimed at checking black money as it is made out to be. It emerges that black money holders were given time to secure their assets. Recent deposits made by the BJP have also come under a cloud.” He said the Prime Minister was on tour as the country was going through a chaotic phase. Patients were finding it difficult to buy medicines and avail themselves of treatment at hospitals; ration shops were being looted and people were driven to suicide after finding their hard earned money blocked. The Centre, he said, had failed to make alternative arragement and to ensure sufficient stocks of currency to replace the denominations that had ceased to become legal tender. He urged the government to permit transactions in Rs.1,000 and Rs.500 notes up to December 30, the time allowed for exchange of notes. Mr. Vijayan said he would try to meet Union Finance Minister Arun Jaitley to convey the State’s concerns about the chaos caused by demonetisation and its impact on the common man.

Soundarraj, district secretary, Kanniyakumari District Cooperative Employees’ Association, affiliated to the CITU, here on Sunday. Mr. Soundarraj told The Hindu that the normal functioning of the PACCS throughout the country was affected, as they could not disburse maturity amounts on fixed deposits and recurring deposits to its members, and the members were not able even to redeem their pledged jewels in time. Self-Help Group (SHG) members and Joint Liability Groups (JLGs), having account with the PACCS, were not able to transact any business. This affected recovery of loans, and the farmers were not able to avail themselves of crop loans and buy fertilizers, he said. The shortage of Rs. 100 notes and those below the denomination rendered the people unable to buy essential commodities from ration shops, he added. As the PACCS were not authorised to accept demonetised currencies, normal life of the rural people, especially the farmers and the downtrodden, was seriously affected, Mr. Soundarraj said. S. Suresh Kumar, president, Tirunandikkarai Primary Agriculture Cooperative Credit Society, said ever since the announcement of the invalidation of high value currencies, the day-to-day activities of the PACCS had come to a standstill. When contacted, a top official of Cooperative Department said only District Cooperative Banks (DCBs) and Urban Cooperative Banks were authorised to receive old currencies from the customers. They were not able to transact any other normal business. To avoid malpractice in registering old notes with back date, the officials had collected closing cash balance as on November 8 from all the DCBs and the UCBs, the official added. The farmers, however, could avail themselves of crop loans from the PACCS. The farmers’ applications should be sent to the DCBs or the UCBs for cash credit facility. Once, the loans were sanctioned, the farmers had to open Savings Bank accounts and withdraw the money from the concerned bank, he added.

The CII said the demonetisation would curb illegal activities like corruption, racketeering, human trafficking and gambling. “For industry, this is a welcome move with very positive implications.

Ms. Banerjee has criticised the Centre’s move and asked it to withdraw the “hasty decision” and “first put a proper action plan in place.” Mr. Kejriwal has called the ban on Rs. 500 and 1,000 notes as the “biggest scam in recent times.” On Sunday, Mr. Singh held a meeting with Finance Minister Arun Jaitley and officials of the security establishment to analyse the security complications arising out of the cash crunch. “The main thrust of the meeting was to look for measures to reduce queues outside banks and ATMs. Another important points discussed were ways to stop rumour mongering and mischievous news that were only adding to the confusion,” said the official. Parliament session The Parliament session begins this week and Mr. Singh who also heads the Cabinet Committee on Parliamentary Affairs (CCPA) is to meet several political leaders, cutting across party lines, for the smooth functioning of the House.

   By about 4 a.m. all shops – about 170 – were open on both sides of an unkempt asphalt road. The shops that were selling fish at a wholesale rate were chock-a-block by 5 a.m.. But many of them were not engaging with the trading. They were small rural fish farmers and sellers, big purchasers from Kolkata. They assembled in Malancha, a gigantic wholesale fish market, about 100 kilometres south of Kolkata, in Sunderbans area, to buy or sell fish like any other day. But the market is 40% to 50% “dry”, they said. “We assembled early morning, out of habit,” said Gorachand Mondal, a small fish farmer from nearby Chaita village. Malancha is perhaps the largest wholesale fish market in south Bengal, in North 24 Paraganas district, auctioning about 15 thousand kilogram of fish every day. There are at least a dozen such wholesale markets in south Bengal. And, all are distressed over the demonetisation drive. The owner of one of the biggest wholesale depot in Malancha – Sonali Fish Centre – belongs to Azibor Rahman. Mr Rahman is in the trade for nearly 50 years but has never witnessed such depression. “We generate business in lakhs but the banks told us to deposit less than Rs. 2.5 lakh. Moreover, the buyers are tendering Rs. 1,000 notes, which is difficult for us to accept. How are banks benefitting if we are not depositing?” Mr Rahman said. With an withdrawal limit of Rs. 10,000 a day, Mr. Rahman refused to pay change to his son, Amjad Ali Molla, a trainee trader. He literally cried before his dad tendered few Rs. 100 notes. The situation is grim for small farmers. “I earn about Rs. 400 to Rs. 500 daily and spend about Rs. 200 to run the household expenses. We deal in Rs. 100 notes and not in Rs. 1000 notes which have disappeared,” Gorachand Mondal said. In his village, the families are incapable of supporting each other. “All ran out of change…in next two days we will be on road, begging.” He shared another alarming information. ""Many of the farmers here are illiterate and keep the cash at home. It’s legal money but they are scared to go to bank traditionally. They are now short-changed by the local agents who are charging 20 per cent for providing ‘change’,"" said Mr. Mondal. While Mr. Mondal is at the bottom rung of the trade, Mr. Rahman, a wholesaler, auctions the stock to buyers – traders from cities – charging sellers a tiny fee. They both have now started gasping for lower denomination notes as the big purchasers, like Abdul Rashid Molla, also a supplier to big cities, are staying off the market. Instead of entering the Malancha market, 60-year-old Molla is sitting in a tea stall; chewing tobacco and glancing through newspaper. “They are all like brothers and there is no point in fighting for Rs. 100 notes,” he said. The absence of men like Mr. Molla, who supplies to Kolkata’s retail outlets, is putting a strain on the market. The worst sufferers, however, are small farmers like Gorachand Mondal as they do not have cash savings in small denomination.

193,2016-11-13,6.0,Demonetisation pays off for civic body,"Despite being a holiday, the tax collection counters of the Coimbatore Corporation witnessed a steady inflow of tax payers on Saturday who wanted to dispose off the demonetised Rs.500 and Rs.1000 currencies.   The decision of the civic body to extend the deadline to accept old Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,000 notes have helped in achieving higher tax collection. On November 8, the civic body registered 43 per cent tax realisation. The tax revenue for the civic body included property tax, water charges, fee other than taxes, vacant land tax, professional tax, miscellaneous charges and service tax. The Corporation was even contemplating steps to disconnect the drinking water connections of habitual defaulters. On November 8, the Corporation’s tax revenue never looked healthy as the third quarter of the fiscal was almost nearing completion and hardly another 140 days to go for the fiscal year to end. However, the announcement on demonetisation of Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,000 came as a shot in the arm for the civic body. It used the grace period given by the Government of India to make the tax payers fall in line. The decision to extend the period till November 14 has helped the civic body as well as the public. On November 9 alone, the civic body collected Rs. 50 lakh and till November 9, the realisation was Rs 2.10 lakh and the total percentage was 43. Once, the acceptance of demonetised currencies were announced the tax realisation graph witnessed a steady upward trend. On November 11 alone, the civic body netted close to Rs. 11 crore and on November 12, when the tax counters remained opened despite being a holiday, the revenue stood at Rs 4.70 crore. In just two days tax the revenue witnessed a quantum jump of seven per cent and touching a 50 per cent mark, pointed out K. Vijayakarthikeyan, Special Officer and Commissioner of Coimbatore Corporation. The higher rate of realisation always used to be only during the months of February and March, when the fiscal year draws to a close, officials pointed out.

  A large number of people gathered at Bhanu Nagar (HB Colony) on Saturday as reports spread like wildfire that someone dumped a bag carrying currency notes in a drain. According to unconfirmed reports someone came in a car and dumped the bag at about 8 p.m. The telecast of the incident by a TV channel led to a large congregation of people from the nearby areas. A resident of the area, Kanaka Raju, said he rushed to the spot on watching a scrolling on TV. He was told that several people had jumped into the drain and fled after collecting their ‘prized catch’. Eyewitnesses said the notes could either be counterfeit or to evade getting caught by Income Tax sleuths, someone might have thrown away them in the drain. The police said they would verify whether the notes reportedly thrown were counterfeit or black money.

195,2016-11-13,6.0,Rural residents in Yadgir hit hard by demonetisation,"Village residents have been hit hard by the demonetisation of currency in the denomination of Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,000 as many people were forced to stand in long queues since morning on Saturday to exchange invalid notes and withdraw money from their accounts. Banks were flooded with people and officials were forced to down the shutters for some time to bring the situation under control and refill the ATMs. “Three of us came from Gurmiktal village to exchange the currency. Bank staff are saying that only Rs. 4,000 could be exchanged,” a man, who was standing in the queue, said. Branch manager of a private bank said they were providing Rs. 10,000 (currency in the denomination of Rs. 2,000) for customers who furnish an identity proof; Rs. 4,000 for exchanging invalid notes; and Rs. 2,000 from ATMs. “We are managing the situation and hopefully the problems due to lack of currency will be solved in a day or two,” he said. There were very few customers in grocery shops, cloth shops and other petty shops. The demonetisation has also impacted the routine collection of the North-Eastern Karnataka Road Transport Corporation (NEKRTC) . Rural people were boarding private vehicles as conductors were not permitting passengers, who do not have currency below Rs. 500, to board the buses. “We are facing a shortfall of Rs. 2 lakh to Rs. 4 lakh a day in collection. Against the average collection of Rs. 28 lakh to Rs. 30 lakh a day, we are getting only Rs. 26 lakh,” Santosh Gogeri, divisional controller of Yadgir division, told The Hindu. “People are waiting for arrival of buses to get notes in the denomination of Rs. 100,” a conductor said. In the meanwhile, many ATMs were out of order owing to shortage of cash.

196,2016-11-13,6.0,They make hay amid demonetisation chaos,"A file photo of youngsters enjoying Go Karting in Visakhapatnam.   ‘Necessity is the mother of invention’ goes the famous proverb. Some smart business entrepreneurs in Visakhapatnam and neighbouring regions seem to have understood the true essence of this and are making the best of the present currency crunch by coming out with clever marketing strategies to keep the cash registers ringing even as several trade and commercial establishments struggle to tide over the crisis generated by the demonetisation of Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 currency notes. Hub For Youth Go Karting Arena at Mangamaripeta is offering a special package of Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 to encourage people to enjoy an evening there and spend the demonetised notes. “We are offering a special package of four games for Rs 500, which is otherwise charged at Rs 800. Similarly, people can play games worth Rs 1,600 by just paying the demonetised currency of Rs 1,000. We plan to keep this offer on till the end of December,” said Pramod Kumar of Hub for Youth Go Karting Arena. Interestingly, the Go Karting arena has seen their business go up by 40 per cent on Saturday as several people turned up at the entertainment zone to chill out in the weekend and part with the demonetised currencies. “We normally see a daily business of Rs 45,000 on an average. Today, we made Rs 80,000 and are expecting a good turnout on Sunday as well,” Kumar added. A similar strategy worked out well for Plot 17 restaurant that didn’t waste time in bringing out a smart marketing tactics to attract customers. Shortly after the news of demonetisation was out, the restaurant came out with an offer wherein customers could give their Rs 500 notes and enjoy meal worth Rs 600. “We normally get customers who spend Rs 200 or Rs 300 on an average on a single bill. But the initial days were difficult for us as returning change to customers were an issue in the absence of access to banks or ATMs. So we came out with this special package encouraging people to spend the demonetised currency. The response was very encouraging. We had people who visited us four times a day from breakfast to dinner,” said Sumanth Behara of Plot 17 on running the successful two-day campaign. For Voonna Rohit, proprietor of Deccan Fried Chicken in Srikakulam, it was like killing two birds with one stone. While the Kartika Masam is normally a dull season for non-vegetarian outlets, the effect of demonetisation has come as double blow for many outlets. But Rohit has managed to turn it to his favour with a special offer wherein people can give their Rs 500 note and get food worth Rs 1,000. “The one-plus-one offer has seen tremendous response. In this season, we see only 150 orders daily. After coming out with this offer, we are getting 300 orders on a day,” said Rohit, who will keep the offer on till November 16. Many other small businesses in the region are accepting the demonetised notes in order to spur sales.

Stalin on Saturday said the scrapping of Rs. 500 and Rs. 1000 notes had caused enormous hardship to middle class, farmers, traders and fishermen. In a statement, he said even the government had not come out with any plan to make the exchange of currency easier for the people. “Even though the Centre’s move was aimed at eradicating black money, it has actually hit the ordinary people hard. On the one hand banks have very limited notes of Rs. 2,000 and on the other people are not able to utilise the money for lack of smaller denominations,” he said. “Goods transport has borne the brunt and small traders have lost their business. People are standing in queue in front of banks and ATMs for hours together while Prime Minister Narendra Modi is travelling in bullet train in Japan,” he said. Mr. Stalin said that since fish was a perishable commodity, fishermen , who were not able to sell their catch, had called for an indefinite strike. “Finance Minister O. Panneerselvan has not yet announced any measures to make it easier for people and fishermen,” he said.

198,2016-11-13,6.0,"Agricultural, business activities in rural areas worst hit by demonetisation","The agricultural and business activities in rural areas in the district that have limited access to banking facilities, have suffered serious setbacks owing to the demonetisation of currency of Rs. 1,000 and Rs. 500 denomination. Arecanut processing Naveen Kashyap, an arecanut grower from Daanawadi village, told The Hindu, that the work of de-husking, drying and processing of arecanut has commenced in command areas of Bhadra reservoir. However, owing to the demonetisation, plantation owners are finding it difficult to arrange money for payment of wages to workers. The paucity of cash has forced the plantation owners to postpone the work of de-husking and processing of arecanut, he said. A majority of agricultural labours have remained outside the purview of the formal banking system as a result of which payment through cheque or electronic fund transfer cannot be made to them. The government should exempt farmers from the ceiling imposed on withdrawal of cash from bank accounts and from ATMs, Mr. Kashyap said. Maize Suresh, a farmer from Balur village in Shikaripur taluk is also facing a similar problem. The harvesting of maize crop on his land and the work of levelling of land on another plot owned by him, where he was planning to plant arecanut saplings, has been delayed owing to paucity of cash. The food industry in rural areas is the worst affected owing to demonitisation. Decline in orders Eshwaran P. Teertha, an entrepreneur from Kudligere village, who runs a food firm involved in producing wide range of products from millets and native rice varieties said, there has been a decline in orders from hotels and supermarkets in urban areas for his products from past three days. The payment for those who supply raw materials including tender mangoes, lemon, millets, coconut and spices for food industries has also been delayed, he said. Long queue Siddeshwar C., who runs an outlet of electronic gadgets in Shiralakoppa, said that in Shiralakoppa it was necessary to wait in queue in the banks for at least five hours to exchange currency notes or withdraw of money from accounts. The rural people are postponing the purchase of electronic gadgets and vehicles.

199,2016-11-13,6.0,Demonetisation slows down economic activity,"People waiting at a branch of the State Bank of Travancore in Thiruvananthapuram to exchange higher-end currency notes on Saturday.
  The demonetisation of Rs.500 and Rs.1,000 denominations and the consequent currency shortage have slowed down the economic activity in the State, leaving the population resentful because they could not get sufficient cash in the lower denominations needed for daily expenses. Banks across the State opened special cash counters to meet the currency rush, but short supply of currency notes, particularly Rs.100 notes, neutralised their efforts. Cash dispensing through Automated Teller Machines (ATMs) was limited. Some banks could operate ATMs attached to their respective branches. But smaller banks preferred to shut down their ATM booths. The currency note shortage tested the tempers of customers, leading to altercation in several bank branches. The banks did not come out with any official explanations, taking cover behind the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), which too did not give any indication about when a solution would come by. Various sectors have started feeling the pinch of the currency shortage. Problems related to weekly wage payment across sectors, including plantation and construction, have added to the apprehension of the workforce. The retail sector too is grappling with the crisis. Short supply of smaller denominations affected the low income group, particularly in the rural areas, who are not accustomed to online transactions. Leader of the Opposition Ramesh Chennithala and former Chief Minister Oommen Chandy came out strongly against the Central government’s failure to address the issue.

  The woes of the people over the currency crisis continued for yet another day on Saturday in both urban and rural areas of Salem and Namakkal districts with the ATMs of all the banks remaining closed throughout and the queues at the bank branches getting longer. Though Reserve Bank of India had come out with an announcement that the ATMs will function as usual from Friday onwards, but a majority of the ATM centres did not open even on Saturday much to the disappointment of a large number of people. One or two ATMs which started functioning by the break of dawn in Salem city, downed shutters within an hour. Enquiries with bankers revealed that the banks could not complete recalibration of these machines to allow withdrawal up to Rs. 2,000 to begin with. Non-availability of adequate stock of Rs. 100 currency was said to be another reason for the non-functioning of the ATMs. Rumours are ripe among the people that it will take more time for streamlining the ATMs to the new process. A cross-section of the people have urged the RBI to take steps for rushing adequate lower denomination notes to the district. On receipt of SMS from some private banks that cash could be collected at their ATMs and scrapped notes could be deposited in their branches, people rushed to the ATMs of such banks, only to be disappointed. Meanwhile the serpentine queues lengthened outside the bank branches and the head post offices and sub-offices. A majority of the bank branches handed over only Rs. 2,000 worth lower denomination currency, despite the assurance that the people can exchange to a maximum of Rs. 4,000. The currency exchange process continued till noon only, with the banks running dry of money. The people who turned up at the banks for depositing the higher denomination notes in their accounts complained that only one counter functioned in the banks. They demanded opening of atleast two counters for hassle-free depositing of money. While many bank branches stopped disbursing the smaller denomination notes by noon itself, both the head post offices in Salem city and at Suramangalam continued disbursing money till evening, bringing some respite to the people. In Namakkal district too, a few ATMs functioning in the morning for some time and downed the shutters after becoming dry. The 268 branches of the banks in Namakkal and other major towns of Tiruchengode, Komarapalayam, Paramathivelur, Rasipuram which disbursed the new Rs. 2,000 currency and lower denomination notes were brimming with people throughout the day. The head post office and all the sub-post offices in Salem East Postal Division will function on Sunday to enable the people to exchange the Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,000 currency notes.

In a statement issued here on Saturday, P. Selvaraju, president, Salem District Petroleum Dealers Association, said that on the direction of the Centre, the petrol bunks are accepting the scrapped Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,000 currency from the public ever since currency crisis surfaced in the country. However, due to paucity of smaller denomination currency, the bunks are not able to provide the Rs. 100 and Rs. 50 notes to the customers. This leads to unpleasant scenes and even to violence in the petrol bunks frequently. He said that the banks are providing small denomination currency to the tune of Rs. 4,000 only to each of the retail outlets, which is very much inadequate to meet the demand of the large number consumers who turn up at the petrol bunks. The banks are refusing to provide more small denomination currency, much to the anxiety of petroleum dealers. Demanding higher cash withdrawal limits, Mr. Selvaraju urged the district administration to intervene and ensure that the banks provided smaller denomination currency of Rs. 100 and Rs. 50 to the tune of Rs. 50,000 to each of the petrol bunk to run hassle-free business. The non-provision of adequate Rs. 100 and Rs. 50 currency will badly hit the petroleum dealers, which in turn will affect the consumers, he added.

The industry online registration — Udyog Aadhaar — was linked with the Aadhaar and PAN cards and GST would add to the economic development of the nation in the background of demonetisation, Mr. Jain said. MIA appealed to micro and small enterprises who do not have bank accounts and VAT registration to not depend on anti-social elements for conversion of their money but to go directly to banks with the Udyog Aadhaar card, open an account and transact safely.

The MCC had launched a special tax collection drive to collect water bills worth Rs. 130 crore, but the response was not encouraging. When the MCC announced that it would accept the banned Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,000 notes towards the payment of water bills and property tax, people made use of the opportunity and cleared their dues. Mayor B.L. Bhyrappa told The Hindu that the MCC received Rs. 90 lakh towards water dues since Friday. A sum of Rs. 1 crore was collected in the form of property tax in one day. “We will work on Sunday till 6.30 p.m. and on Monday too. Taxpayers can make use of the facility,” he said. A staff at the MCC counter said: “Many are coming to clear their water dues using the banned notes. This is revenue for us.” Similar scenes were seen at the bill collection counters of Chamundeshwari Electricity Supply Corporation since provision had been made for paying electricity bills. Queues outside the counters were long and most people paid using the banned notes.

  The huge rush for exchanging old currency notes for notes of smaller denomination or the new ones continued for the third consecutive day on Saturday even as most of the Automated Teller Machines (ATMs) in the city remained non-functional. Long queues were seen outside major bank branches in Puducherry with people waiting for hours to get the currency notes exchanged for the new Rs. 2,000 notes issued by the Reserve Bank of India. Except a few, most of the banks kept their ATMs closed for hours. Normal life of the middle class, the salaried class and small-time vendors remained affected owing to shortage of cash. Meanwhile, the government has permitted the use of old Rs. 500 and Rs.1,000 notes for various utility services till November 14. The Electricity Department will accept old notes towards bill payment till November 14, an official said.

206,2016-11-13,6.0,?Inappropriate implementation of demonetisation hurting people?,"Though the union government’s decision to demonetise Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,500 currency notes was predominantly welcomed initially, the inappropriate implementation of the scheme had defeated the benefits and stifled business transactions, Tamil Nadu Chamber of Commerce and Industry has said. Stating that the government’s objective should be to unearth black money and not put the public in distress, the chamber has said that the initial excitement was now turning into frustration. In a press statement issued on Saturday, the chamber has pointed out the main cause of concern was the non-availability of Rs. 100 and the new Rs. 500 denomination notes in banks. “Most of the ATMs are yet to become fully functional. When people exchange currencies, only Rs. 2,000 notes are given, which does not help meet daily needs as they will not get change anywhere,” said S. Rethinavelu, senior president of the chamber. The chamber also said in the statement that wholesale traders were facing trouble since their clients, mainly retail businesses, were paying the daily collections in Rs. 500 and Rs. 1000, which cannot be accepted now as they were no longer legal tender. The chamber has demanded that the traders be allowed a window till December 15 to collect their business outstandings in old Rs. 500 and Rs. 1000 denominations. It also made a demand that deposits made by individuals up to Rs. 5 lakh should not be scrutinised. “When people exchange currencies, only Rs. 2,000 notes are given” Printable version | Jan 7, 2017 1:14:11 AM | http://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/%E2%80%9CInappropriate-implementation-of-demonetisation-hurting-people%E2%80%9D/article16444026.ece © The Hindu Notwithstanding the frequent harassment on charges of trespass into Sri Lankan waters, Tamil Nadu fishermen struggle to get permission to visit the annual festival at St. Anthony’ Church in Katchatheevu."

While the ATMs of the SBH, Indian Bank, Axis Bank and the Corporation Bank remained closed, people stood in long queues before the ATMs of other banks to withdraw cash of Rs. 2,000. Several ATMs were open, but ran out of cash, and the card-holders returned dejected. Customers who made withdrawal at Kotak Mahindra Bank branches were given Rs. 2,000 note each, as the bank had no currency of other denominations. Those exchanging Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,000 notes got two Rs. 2,000 notes. The scene was different in Andhra Bank branches, where people exchanging the banned notes for Rs. 4,000 were given two bundles of Rs. 20 notes, as the bank ran out of Rs. 100 notes. However, account holders withdrawing cash from the ICICI Bank were given three notes of Rs. 2,000 and 40 notes of Rs. 100. Petrol pumps accepted Rs. 500 notes on the condition that they would fill petrol worth the amount.

Banks were flooded with people and officials were forced to down the shutters for some time to bring the situation under control and refill the ATMs. “Three of us came from Gurmiktal village to exchange the currency. Bank staff are saying that only Rs. 4,000 could be exchanged,” a man, who was standing in the queue, said. Hopeful Branch manager of a private bank said they were providing Rs. 10,000 (currency in the denomination of Rs. 2,000) for customers who furnish an identity proof; Rs. 4,000 for exchanging invalid notes; and Rs. 2,000 from ATMs. “We are managing the situation and hopefully the problems due to lack of currency will be solved in a day or two,” he said. There were very few customers in grocery shops, cloth shops and other petty shops. The demonetisation has also impacted the routine collection of the North-Eastern Karnataka Road Transport Corporation (NEKRTC) . NEKRTC revenue Rural people were boarding private vehicles as conductors were not permitting passengers, who do not have currency below Rs. 500, to board the buses. “We are facing a shortfall of Rs. 2 lakh to Rs. 4 lakh a day in collection. Against the average collection of Rs. 28 lakh to Rs. 30 lakh a day, we are getting only Rs. 26 lakh,” Santosh Gogeri, divisional controller of Yadgir division, told The Hindu . “People are waiting for arrival of buses to get notes in the denomination of Rs. 100,” a conductor said.

209,2016-11-13,6.0,Banks keep an eye out for illegal currency exchange,"Suspecting unscrupulous elements of engaging carriers, mostly migrant labourers, to get their unaccounted money exchanged, banks are working to make their systems foolproof to ensure that no same person makes successive exchanges. According to the latest Reserve Bank of India (RBI) notification, a person can exchange Rs.4,000 worth Old High Denomination (OHD) currency notes over bank counters once in 15 days. However, senior bank officials told The Hindu that instances where the same individuals turning up successively for exchange using different ID proof documents had come to their notice. They were turned away without cash, but they might have succeeded at other branches. Sensing a possible fraud in the making, banks are working on a system to remain alert to multiple exchanges by the same persons. Officials also warned of a possibility of such illegal exchange of unaccounted money through the shops and firms doing brisk business. There were reports of a woman lottery vendor near Marine Drive being approached by some men who offered her commission for exchanging currency on their behalf. Besides, some banks had received fake currency notes though their number was negligible. “We are destroying such notes rather than turning those responsible over to the police since it is possible that they might have landed those one-off fake notes accidentally,” a bank official said. Meanwhile, the police said it was for banks to have a system to flag such illegal exchanges. “Migrant workers without bank accounts and have saved their salaries over several months might try to get them exchanged through Rs.4,000 lots, and they cannot be put under scanner for possessing cash. What the police can do is verify cases referred by banks,” Deputy Commissioner of Police Arul R.B. Krishna said. As such there is already enough confusion, and the police do not want to add to the confusion by interfering in monetary transactions. The police are also keeping track of bulk movement of cash, he added. “Our role is restricted to maintaining law and order for which we have deployed additional men near ATMs and banks. We have intensified patrolling and have even put up a picket in front of the RBI,” Mr. Krishna said.

  Demonetisation will have multiple effects transforming from cash to banking economy, paralyse terror funding and circulation of counterfeit notes and widen the tax base, according to Income-Tax Chief Commissioner Shyama Prasad Choudhury. In an exclusive interview to The Hindu here on Saturday on the fallout of the withdrawal of Rs.500 and Rs.1,000 notes as legal tender by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Mr. Choudhury, who heads operations in AP, said increased use of debit and credit cards and digital wallets would raise the number of bank account holders and help fill the coffers of the government. “The more important aspect is putting a full-stop to funding the terror networks and huge amount of fake notes being circulated by the terrorists and anti-national forces into the market. The bold move will certainly help the economy manifold,” he said. Mr. Choudhury said their intention was not to conduct raids as it was an ultimate option. “The government’s focus is to increase tax compliance rate and make all transactions transparent. The fallout of demonetisation will be safeguarding the interest of the nation and facilitate extra revenue collections.” He expressed satisfaction over the response to the Income Disclosure Scheme (IDS)-2016 in which a disclosure of Rs.13,000 crore was made in Andhra Pradesh and Telangana out of Rs.65,000 crore disclosed pan India. The tax on the disclosed amount as notified earlier would be collected by September, 2017. The Chief Commissioner said besides educating the public on tax compliance, they would also continue keeping a tab on unaccounted assets and transactions by taking videos of lavish spending at marriages and other social functions. He said search and seizure operations were being undertaken based on inputs received by the department through various sources including social media. He said as far as the Income Tax Region in Visakhapatnam was concerned, the collections as on November 10 was Rs .1900 crore compared to Rs.1471 crore last year. Refunds On complaints regarding delay in refunds, he said following a series of measures, they had streamlined the payment. A refund of Rs.355.40 crore was paid so far as against Rs.222.8 crore during the corresponding period in the region. Net collections registered a growth rate of 23.4 per cent against an all India percentage of 10.3 per cent.

According to unconfirmed reports someone came in a car and dumped the bag at about 8 p.m. The telecast of the incident by a TV channel led to a large congregation of people from the nearby areas. A resident of the area, Kanaka Raju, said he rushed to the spot on watching a scrolling on TV. He was told that several people had jumped into the drain and fled after collecting their ‘prized catch’. Eyewitnesses said the notes could either be counterfeit or to evade getting caught by Income Tax sleuths, someone might have thrown away them in the drain. The police said they would verify whether the notes reportedly thrown were counterfeit or black money.

  The decision of the civic body to extend the deadline to accept old Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,000 notes have helped in achieving higher tax collection. On November 8, the civic body registered 43 per cent tax realisation. The tax revenue for the civic body included property tax, water charges, fee other than taxes, vacant land tax, professional tax, miscellaneous charges and service tax. The Corporation was even contemplating steps to disconnect the drinking water connections of habitual defaulters. On November 8, the Corporation’s tax revenue never looked healthy as the third quarter of the fiscal was almost nearing completion and hardly another 140 days to go for the fiscal year to end. However, the announcement on demonetisation of Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,000 came as a shot in the arm for the civic body. It used the grace period given by the Government of India to make the tax payers fall in line. The decision to extend the period till November 14 has helped the civic body as well as the public. On November 9 alone, the civic body collected Rs. 50 lakh and till November 9, the realisation was Rs 2.10 lakh and the total percentage was 43. Once, the acceptance of demonetised currencies were announced the tax realisation graph witnessed a steady upward trend. On November 11 alone, the civic body netted close to Rs. 11 crore and on November 12, when the tax counters remained opened despite being a holiday, the revenue stood at Rs 4.70 crore. In just two days tax the revenue witnessed a quantum jump of seven per cent and touching a 50 per cent mark, pointed out K. Vijayakarthikeyan, Special Officer and Commissioner of Coimbatore Corporation. The higher rate of realisation always used to be only during the months of February and March, when the fiscal year draws to a close, officials pointed out.

214,2016-11-13,6.0,Demonetisation slows down economic activity,"Though banks across Kerala opened special cash counters to meet the currency rush, short supply of Rs. 100 notes, in particular, rendering futile their efforts.
  The demonetisation of Rs.500 and Rs.1,000 denominations and the consequent currency shortage have slowed down the economic activity in the State, leaving the population resentful because they could not get sufficient cash in the lower denominations needed for daily expenses. Banks across the State opened special cash counters to meet the currency rush, but short supply of currency notes, particularly Rs.100 notes, neutralised their efforts. Cash dispensing through Automated Teller Machines (ATMs) was limited. Some banks could operate ATMs attached to their respective branches. But smaller banks preferred to shut down their ATM booths. The currency note shortage tested the tempers of customers, leading to altercation in several bank branches. No explanation The banks did not come out with any official explanations, taking cover behind the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), which too did not give any indication about when a solution would come by. Various sectors have started feeling the pinch of the currency shortage. Problems related to weekly wage payment across sectors, including plantation and construction, have added to the apprehension of the workforce. The retail sector too is grappling with the crisis. Short supply of smaller denominations affected the low income group, particularly in the rural areas, who are not accustomed to online transactions. Leader of the Opposition Ramesh Chennithala and former Chief Minister Oommen Chandy came out strongly against the Central government’s failure to address the issue.

216,2016-11-13,6.0,Demonetisation will deter terror funding in India: Minister,"Stating that the decision taken by the Union government to demonetise the currency notes of Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 was in the interest of the security of the nation, Union Minister of State in the PMO Jitendra Singh on Saturday said the step would deter the funding of terrorism in the country. “It (demonetising Rs 500 and Rs 1,000) is going to be a major deterrence as far as the funding of terrorism is concerned. This was one of the main considerations to have arrived on this decision,” Mr Singh told reporters on the sidelines of a function here. He said what was remarkable about the decision was that it was in the larger interest of the nation, in the interest of the security of the nation as well, “as the interest of the reinforcing economic capability of the nation.” “I think what is more gratifying is that the common man of the country has welcomed it,” he said. On the allegations leveled by the Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal, Mr Singh said that the statements which lack any evidence don’t deserve a response. “I don’t think it deserves any response, we live in an evidence based era and I don’t think I need to respond to any unsubstantiated statements,” he said. “Move welcomed” “The 130 crore people of this country have wholeheartedly welcomed it. I was traveling in Uttar Pradesh yesterday, day before in Delhi and today in Jammu and have seen long queues outside the banks of an average common man and inspite of going through all the inconvenience ... there was not a single one who did not say that they did not welcome it,” he said. He said the decision was being hailed as it has come out with sincerity, honesty and courage of Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Taking a dig at Rahul Gandhi for standing in a queue at an ATM in Delhi, the Union Minister sought to know who used to go to the ATM on behalf of the Congress Vice President before the decision was taken. “I usually avoid making personal comments but what amused me was that I wish somebody had asked him had he ever been to an ATM before or was it just after this, decision happened. Who was going to ATM on his behalf on earlier occasions?,” he questioned. - PTI Printable version | Jan 7, 2017 1:14:31 AM | http://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/Demonetisation-will-deter-terror-funding-in-India-Minister/article16444076.ece © The Hindu The Hindu revisits the gruesome December 2012 gang-rape to examine if Delhi is any safer for the average woman today"

Arecanut processing Naveen Kashyap, an arecanut grower from Daanawadi village, told The Hindu, that the work of de-husking, drying and processing of arecanut has commenced in command areas of Bhadra reservoir. However, owing to the demonetisation, plantation owners are finding it difficult to arrange money for payment of wages to workers. The paucity of cash has forced the plantation owners to postpone the work of de-husking and processing of arecanut, he said. A majority of agricultural labours have remained outside the purview of the formal banking system as a result of which payment through cheque or electronic fund transfer cannot be made to them. ‘Exemot farmers’ The government should exempt farmers from the ceiling imposed on withdrawal of cash from bank accounts and from ATMs, Mr. Kashyap said. Suresh, a farmer from Balur village in Shikaripur taluk is also facing a similar problem. The harvesting of maize crop on his land and the work of levelling of land on another plot owned by him, where he was planning to plant arecanut saplings, has been delayed owing to paucity of cash. Decline in orders The food industry in rural areas is the worst affected owing to demonitisation. Eshwaran P. Teertha, an entrepreneur from Kudligere village, who runs a food firm involved in producing wide range of products from millets and native rice varieties said, there has been a decline in orders from hotels and supermarkets in urban areas for his products from past three days. The payment for those supplying raw materials such as tender mangoes, lemon, millets, coconut and spices for food industries has also been delayed, he said. Long queues Siddeshwar C., who runs an outlet of electronic gadgets in Shiralakoppa, said that in Shiralakoppa it was necessary to wait in queue in the banks for at least five hours to exchange currency notes or withdraw of money from accounts.

On the one hand banks have very limited notes of Rs. 2,000 and on the other people are not able to utilise the money for lack of smaller denominations,” he said. “Goods transport has borne the brunt and small traders have lost their business. People are standing in queue in front of banks and ATMs for hours together while Prime Minister Narendra Modi is travelling in bullet train in Japan,” he said.

220,2016-11-13,6.0,?Demonetisation will not check black money?,"Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav on Saturday said demonetisation of Rs 500 and Rs 1000 currency notes will not serve the purpose of checking black money. “It’s good that corruption is checked and people become aware that there should not be (any) corruption. But this problem cannot be overcome merely by changing Rs 500 and Rs 1000 notes...those who used to keep such notes are now waiting for Rs 2000 notes...,” Mr Yadav said. “The government needs to ensure that things like these (corruption) are not repeated in future,” he said on the sidelines of a programme here. - PTI Printable version | Jan 7, 2017 1:14:37 AM | http://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/%E2%80%9CDemonetisation-will-not-check-black-money%E2%80%9D/article16444080.ece © The Hindu The Hindu revisits the gruesome December 2012 gang-rape to examine if Delhi is any safer for the average woman today"
221,2016-11-13,6.0,They make hay amid demonetisation chaos,"‘Necessity is the mother of invention’ goes the famous proverb. Some smart business entrepreneurs in Visakhapatnam and neighbouring regions seem to have understood the true essence of this and are making the best of the present currency crunch by coming out with clever marketing strategies to keep the cash registers ringing even as several trade and commercial establishments struggle to tide over the crisis generated by the demonetisation of Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 currency notes. Hub For Youth Go Karting Arena at Mangamaripeta is offering a special package of Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 to encourage people to enjoy an evening there and spend the demonetised notes. “We are offering a special package of four games for Rs 500, which is otherwise charged at Rs 800. Similarly, people can play games worth Rs 1,600 by just paying the demonetised currency of Rs 1,000. We plan to keep this offer on till the end of December,” said Pramod Kumar of Hub for Youth Go Karting Arena. Interestingly, the Go Karting arena has seen their business go up by 40 per cent on Saturday as several people turned up at the entertainment zone to chill out in the weekend and part with the demonetised currencies. “We normally see a daily business of Rs 45,000 on an average. Today, we made Rs 80,000 and are expecting a good turnout on Sunday as well,” Kumar added. A similar strategy worked out well for Plot 17 restaurant that didn’t waste time in bringing out a smart marketing tactics to attract customers. Shortly after the news of demonetisation was out, the restaurant came out with an offer wherein customers could give their Rs 500 notes and enjoy meal worth Rs 600. “We normally get customers who spend Rs 200 or Rs 300 on an average on a single bill. But the initial days were difficult for us as returning change to customers were an issue in the absence of access to banks or ATMs. So we came out with this special package encouraging people to spend the demonetised currency. The response was very encouraging. We had people who visited us four times a day from breakfast to dinner,” said Sumanth Behara of Plot 17 on running the successful two-day campaign. For Voonna Rohit, proprietor of Deccan Fried Chicken in Srikakulam, it was like killing two birds with one stone. While the Kartika Masam is normally a dull season for non-vegetarian outlets, the effect of demonetisation has come as double blow for many outlets. But Rohit has managed to turn it to his favour with a special offer wherein people can give their Rs 500 note and get food worth Rs 1,000. “The one-plus-one offer has seen tremendous response. In this season, we see only 150 orders daily. After coming out with this offer, we are getting 300 orders on a day,” said Rohit, who will keep the offer on till November 16. Many other small businesses in the region are accepting the demonetised notes in order to spur sales.

222,2016-11-14,7.0,Demonetisation takes the fizz out of property sales,"The impact of demonetisation of Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,000 notes is being felt in the real estate sector, which recorded around 40 per cent slump in transaction in Mysuru. The worst hit is the sale and resale of plots, which entails high volume of cash, unlike the sale of built or ready-to-occupy apartments that are loan-based. A dip in transactions was seen when the demonetisation move was announced on Tuesday night, said senior sub-registrar of Mysuru South M. Vivek. He told The Hindu that the slump in the Mysuru south office was about 15 per cent but it was as high as 40 per cent in three other sub-registrar offices in the city. “Against the average 40 site registrations per day in the Mysuru South office, the figures have come down by 15 per cent and there is a dip in high-value transactions,” he added. However, there was a property registration of Rs. 8.9 crore during this period, Mr. Vivek said. Between Wednesday and Friday, the revenue earned was around Rs.1.3 crore in the Mysuru south office. However, stakeholders, including builders, aver that the slump in real estate transaction was higher. A prominent real estate agent, also into writing deeds, said transactions and registration of sites are down by 50 per cent and only properties with bank loans are being registered. “The scenario will prevail till March 2017 and real estate value will crash further to benefit commoners,” he said. The real estate market in Mysuru was already stagnating and hence, unless there is a distress sale, sellers are expected to hold on to their property to create an artificial scarcity in the long run, according to him. However, the Builders Association of India, Mysuru centre, averred that purchase of flats and apartments by the salaried class has not been affected as funding is through loan. Demonetisation will mostly impact sale of sites, BAI said. But, there is a perception that sale of high-end luxury apartments and properties will be affected. Ongoing projects in Mysuru are set to overrun their deadline owing to demonetisation. Leading builders have scaled down their labour force as they are unable to pay them daily wages. Mahesh, a civil engineer who owns a own construction firm, told The Hindu that he has scaled down the labour force from nearly 150 to 50 per day. “This is a temporary arrangement to beat the liquidity crunch,” he added. Meanwhile, BAI members say demonetisation on real estate will benefit genuine end-users as they can expect a price correction with land value falling by about 30 per cent in the long run. “Cash flow has been blocked and unaccounted money cannot be exchanged without raising suspicion,” said Ravindra Bhat of BAI. He said there was another welcome development. Small-time developers, who fund their projects through informal sources, most of which is untaxed, will be out of business and this will curb the entry of black money, he said.

223,2016-11-14,7.0,Increased availability of currency notes eases tension,"City bankers have attributed the reduced rush of customers at various branches on Monday to the public getting accustomed to the situation and the increased availability of currency notes of Rs.100 and less. “People are less panicky, they are now familiar with the situation,” said a banker, pointing out that only bank branches in certain pockets such as West Kochi witnessed substantial rush during the day. Bank branches in Mattancherry and Willingdon Island saw brisk currency exchange and deposit operations throughout the day. However, the rush was manageable and was expected to stabilise by Tuesday, said another bank official. The rush in these areas has been attributed to the presence of a large number of workers from other States, who are trying to send money home. Manager of a small bank in Aluva said the branch received deposits of around Rs.4 crore over the last two days. Another bank manager said even small branches received deposits to the tune of Rs.1 crore per day. The currency flow was quite stable and people were getting the money they wanted, said an official, who said that around 100 on-site ATMs in the heart of Kochi filled in the morning hours were empty by afternoon. The ATMs were replenished with cash in the late afternoon. “There is sufficient stock of Rs.100 notes,” said a bank official on the outskirts of Kochi. A total of Rs.8 lakh was received by the bank branch on Monday, of which around Rs.6 lakh was in Rs.100 denomination and the rest in denominations of Rs.10 and Rs.20. The situation should be better by Tuesday, said one of the bankers. However, small businesses continued to be hit. Business at the vegetable wholesale market picked up momentum on Monday after a lull of around three days. However, supplies are likely to be restricted on Tuesday as lorries have not left for vegetable markets such as Ottanchatram and Coimbatore because of a strike declared by the Vyapari Vyavasayi Ekopana Samiti. The strike has since been withdrawn. A market stall owner said cool season vegetable supplies would not be restricted as Mettuppalayam supplies are already on their way.

| Photo Credit: SHIV KUMAR PUSHPAKAR The Congress and seven other opposition parties met on Monday — ahead of the Winter Session of Parliament beginning November 16 — to formulate a joint strategy to put the government on the mat on a range of issues including the demonetisation move that has caused great inconvenience to the people, especially the poor . After the meeting, Congress deputy leader in Rajya Sabha Anand Sharma said, “There is broad consensus that the demonetisation issue should be raised in Parliament.” However, with many leaders not available, the opposition parties will meet again on Tuesday afternoon to finalise their plans. The Samajwadi Party and the Bahujan Samaj Party are busy campaigning for the Uttar Pradesh elections and the DMK, AIADMK, NCP and AAP were unrepresented on Monday. Janata Dal(U) leader Sharad Yadav, who was present at the meeting, told The Hindu, “We are hoping to build the sort of opposition unity that we had on the Land Acquisition Act.” The cohesion then had forced the Modi government to replace its draft Bill with one that satisfied the Opposition. On Monday, apart from Mr Yadav, others present at the meeting included the CPI(M)’s Sitaram Yechury, the TMC’s Sudip Bandopadhyay and Derek O'Brien, the CPI’s D. Raja, the RJD’s Prem Chand Gupta, the JMM’s Sushil Kumar and the YSR Congress’s M. Rajamohan Reddy. The Congress was represented by Mr. Sharma and leader in Lok Sabha Mallikarjun Kharge. The leaders also met Leader of Opposition in the Rajya Sabha Ghulam Nabi Azad in Parliament House. The focus of their discussion was on steps to unitedly confront the government on the demonetisation move that had had caused great hardships to the common man. Other subjects discussed included the stalemate between the government and the judiciary that had resulted in many vacancies not being filled as well as the grave situation that farmers across the country were facing. Rivals on the same page If the meeting saw arch rivals TMC and the CPI(M) coming together on a common platform, there was some heartburn among the opposition leaders gathered there that TMC chief and West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee had independently sought time with President Pranab Mukherjee. “We should have all gone together,” said a senior opposition leader at the meeting. Meanwhile, on Monday, Ms. Banerjee, now apparently to forget her rivalry with the Left, tweeted her opposition after Prime Minister Narendra Modi justified the demonetisation move in Ghazipur. “The PM said the poor are sleeping peacefully. This is an insult to commoners. My humble suggestion is not to hit the common people like this.” Printable version | Jan 7, 2017 1:14:59 AM | http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/Opposition-to-corner-Centre-on-demonetisation-fallout/article16445290.ece © The Hindu Be it nature’s fury or man’s folly, destructions are alike.

226,2016-11-14,7.0,UDF flays demonetisation,"The Central government decision to scrap Rs.1,000 and Rs. 500 currency notes sans adequate preparations smacks of the dictatorship of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the United Democratic Front (UDF) has said. Briefing reporters about the decisions of a UDF leadership meet here on Monday, Leader of the Opposition Ramesh Chennithala and other UDF leaders said the decision has caused severe hardships to the people, especially marginalised sections such as farmers and migrant labourers. As the Sabarimala pilgrimage begins on Tuesday, the pilgrims may find the going tough. The UDF would cooperate with all steps taken by the State government to mitigate the woes of the public. UDF leaders would meet Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan on November 17 and discuss the issue. It would also observe November 17 as black day, he said. The meeting demanded that the State government open a control room at the Secretariat and similar facility at Collectorates with toll free numbers so that the public could seek assistance in the event of an emergency. While the public were looking forward to an immediate solution to the crisis, Mr.Modi’s statement that they would have to wait for 50 days has heightened their anxiety. Deepening the crisis, the Centre has also slashed the rice and wheat quota to the State for the beneficiaries on the priority list, he said. There were reports that the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) and the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leadership were privy to the decision to scrap the currency. If the reports are true, it warrants a probe. BJP leader Ram Madhav has defamed the people of Kerala by saying that the State was a centre of hawala transactions, he said. There was a move to destabilise the cooperative sector in Kerala and this was aimed at helping the commercial banks and the corporate rich, he said. Former Chief Minister Oommen Chandy and Indian Union Muslim League leader P.K.Kunhalikutty were among those present at the meeting.

227,2016-11-14,7.0,Gujarat BJP MP raises voice against demonetisation,"The Centre demonetisation move has adversely hit the agriculture sector and if the ""corrective measures"" are not taken immediately, all agriculture marketing produce committees (APMCs) will have to remain shut for at least two months, said Porbandar BJP MP Vithal Radadia. Mr. Radadia and other BJP leaders who are also connected with the state's cooperative sector are set to meet the BJP president Amit Shah in Bharuch where Mrs Shah is scheduled to attend an event. ""First of all, we have to understand that agricultural economy is cash-based. From buying seeds to pesticides and selling produce, the transactions are done in cash,"" Mr. Radadia, who is also chairman of Rajkot District Central Cooperative Bank, told The Hindu. According to him, the RBI has barred all district central cooperative banks, which are connected with millions of farmers from exchanging old notes with new notes and also disbursing new currency notes. ""In my bank, there are one million farmers holding accounts and they cannot do any transactions in the bank because of the RBI's directive. This has to go otherwise millions of farmers will have no where to go for transacting their banking activities."" Another BJP leader Dilip Sanghani, also a former MP and Agriculture Minister of Gujarat, also raised their voice. ""If the farmers are not allowed cash transactions, entire rural and agriculture based economy will take a severe hit,"" Mr Sanghani said. In Gujarat, there are total 207 APMCs and all have been shut since the demonetisation was announced by the Prime Minister on October 8th. ""At least for next two weeks, most of the APMCs will remain shut for trading because traders have no money to make payments while farmers are not used to taking cheque as they demand cash in payments,"" said Congress legislator and chariman of Jamnagar APMC Raghavji Patel.

228,2016-11-14,7.0,Opposition on demonetisation move: Yechury puts off Mamata's offer,"A day after West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee called up CPI (M) leader Sitaram Yechury to suggest a joint opposition to the Modi government's demonetisation move, Mr. Yechury put off a decision on this to a later date, saying the coming winter session of Parliament would allow parties to present their views and alignments. He said that the CPI (M) had already given notices in Parliament to suspend all business to discuss this issue. It was meaningful to meet even the President of India only after demanding the government's explanation in Parliament as soon as it met, he added. Declaring that he had told Ms. Banerjee that the CPI (M) had been opposing the decision from day one, Mr. Yechury told reporters that the government should allow the usage of the old currency for all public utilities and white transactions till December 31 or a few days before that, as the Kerala government had announced. He said the demonetisation decision would hit the poor the most. “Yesterday the PM asked people to give him 50 days. But people are dying as they can't pay for treatment. Allow people to use the old Rs. 500 and Rs. 1000 notes at least in public utilities and for white transactions. The Kerala government has permitted it till December 21,” he said. “Why can't the country and other state governments wanting to protest do this?” Questioning the government's commitment to bringing back black money, he said: “Corruption will double with Rs. 2000 notes. Act against the corrupt. What did the government do after the Narada and Saradha scams, when people were caught on tape accepting cash?” He wondered how the BJP unit in Bengal could withdraw Rs. 3-crore just before the announcement. “Ban donations from corporates to political parties. Party spending in polls has no ceiling till now; only candidate spending has,” he said. Noting that counterfeits of the Rs. 2000 note were already available in the market, Mr. Yechury refused to accept the argument that counterfeit currency necessitated the demonetisation. “ISI Kolkata says that out of the demonetised currency, just 0.028 per cent is counterfeit currency.” He added that terror funding, too, was done through electronic transfers and not through bagfulls of cash. “In 2014, the Prime Minister said 90-percent of the black money was lying in foreign banks. The government has 600 names from Swiss banks. They aren't making these public,” Mr. Yechury said. “While there are huge bank NPAs because of large corporates, the government decided to forgo Rs. 1.12-lack crores last year. While there has been a 26-percent increase in farmers' suicides since Mr. Modi became PM, there is no relief to them.” Mr. Yechury pointed out that Rs. 11-lakh crore had been spent in new printing to implement this decision. He wondered whether this was just with an eye on the Uttar Pradesh polls, so that political rivals could not access their unaccounted for cash.

230,2016-11-14,7.0,Demonetisation: Subramanian Swamy blames FinMin for ?lack of preparedness?,"Senior BJP leader Subramanian Swamy. File photo: Thulasi Kakkat
  BJP MP Subramanian Swamy on Monday criticised the Finance Ministry alleging “lack of preparedness” in dealing with the demonetisation of two high-value currencies and said the Ministry not being in loop of decision-making is “no excuse”. “I am appalled by the lack of preparation... We have been in power for nearly two-and-a-half years. The Finance Ministry should have prepared for this from the very first day. It is easy to argue that the Ministry was not in the loop, but that is no excuse for not having a contingency plan,” Hong Kong’s South China Morning Post daily quoted Mr. Swamy as saying. Mr. Swamy is currently in Hong Kong and will deliver a talk on anti-corruption efforts in India at the Foreign Correspondents Club on November 15, 2016. The Harvard-educated economist further said, “Ad-hoc roadside kiosks should have been set up for all and special kiosks organised for senior citizens. All these should have been planned as part of a contingency plan.” The Rajya Sabha member, who had consistently attacked former RBI Governor Raghuram Rajan and had also taken potshots at Finance Minister Arun Jaitley, said, “The previous government gave the contract for currency paper to the same London-based company that supplies currency paper to Pakistan, helping Pakistan counterfeit Indian notes and finance militancy in India at zero cost.” Asked why the government is yet to book anybody with foreign accounts, he replied, “That question has to be directed at the Finance Ministry, not me. I have no clue why nothing has been done.” On Sunday, Mr. Jaitley had regretted hardships caused due to withdrawal of high denomination notes, but advised the public to be patient as the move will have larger benefits for the economy in the long term.

231,2016-11-14,7.0,"Demonetisation has equalised the rich and the poor, claims Modi","Prime Miniter Narendra Modi flagging off new express train from Ghazipur city to Kolkata (through video conferencing) at Varanasi on Monday.
  As he stressed that the poor strongly backed his decision to demonetise high denomination currency, Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday questioned the moral authority of his political opponents, especially the Congress, in criticising his step as anti-poor and anti-common man. He invoked the Emergency days under then Prime Minister Indira Gandhi, accusing the Congress of enforcing it to only “save Ms. Gandhi’s seat.” In contrast, Mr. Modi asserted, his decision to scrap notes of high denomination was taken in the “interest and happiness of the poor,” the good of the country and the farmer. ''The Congress is worried about people. They enforced Emergency and turned this nation into a jail for 19 months. They restrained newspapers and arrested people who spoke up. Did you do this to fight corruption and the welfare of people? You did it only to save the throne of your PM, Indira Gandhi,” Mr. Modi said. Addressing a parivartan rally in eastern Uttar Pradesh’s Ghazipur a day after his speech in Goa, Mr. Modi reiterated his appeal to people to lend him time, 50 days, and patience to complete the “big task,” a “mahayagna of honesty,” of unearthing black money. A door-to-door operation against black money would have taken years, he observed and stressed that he was left with only “one solution”— scrapping notes of Rs 500 and Rs 1000. As he tried to justify his decision as ‘pro-poor,’ he said the demonetisation had equalised the rich and the poor. His government stood “for the poor, the villages and the farmers.” “India has no shortage of wealth but where is this wealth stored that is a problem. There is little where it is supposed to be, and it is horded at places where it should not be.” Mr. Modi, addressing his first rally in the poll-bound State after the mega overhaul, acknowledged that the common citizen faced hardship due to it. He said he could “experience the suffering” of the “average honest citizen” and was staying up all night, using his “mind and power” to reduce the hardship and would continue to do so. 'Bear the distress for larger good' Urging people to bear the distress for a few days, he equated the situation as similar to a family’s tolerance of the lingering odour of wall paint for the larger good of decorating the house for a marriage. There is some discomfort in everything you do, only the “intention behind it must be well-meaning,” he said to assuage the anxiety of common people whose lives have been sent for a toss due to the crisis in supply of legal tender. Mr. Modi then referred to his own background as a tea-seller to further push the ‘pro-poor card.’ “My decision is a little kadak (strong) like my chai. When I was a child, the poor would especially ask me to make kadak chai (strong tea). The poor is fond of kadak chai. I have a habit since childhood of making kadak chai. The kadak tea suits the poor but warps the expression of the rich,” the Prime Minister said to loud cheers. Even as observers debate the impact of the decision on Uttar Prades polls, a few months away, Mr. Modi credited the role of the State in his fight against corruption by helping his party win a full majority at the Centre in 2014. “It is the power of your vote that the poor is sleeping peacefully and the rich is running around the bazaar to buy sleeping pills.” While targeting his opponents for criticising the demonetisation, Mr. Modi wondered why they were so worried by it. Meanwhile, on the ground, the BJP has been propagating that the BSP and the SP will be worst hit by a fund crunch due to the scrapping of notes. Mr. Modi took a veiled dig at BSP chief Mayawati, who has condemned the demonetisation as an “undeclared financial emergency,” raking up the “garland of notes” she received in the past on her birthday. Modi's poser to Congress In a departure from his teary-eyed address in Goa, an aggressive PM mocked the Congress for asking under which law he had scrapped the notes, while reminding them of their decision to do away with the 25 paise. “What law did you apply then? Who did you ask? It’s another matter you cannot think beyond the 25 paise. You did something of your stature, we did something of ours,” Mr. Modi said. As he raised the pitch, the PM dared “all leaders misleading the people in the name of honesty” to show guts and publicly declare “if notes of Rs 500 and Rs 1000, corruption, black money and dishonesty should continue?” Further reaching out the sensibility of the poor, Mr. Modi claimed he apprehended a threat to himself, as he his act had hurt the interests of the powerful. “I know what I will have to face because those whose coffers are full are powerful. They can buy governments and even bring them down. They can destroy fates of the best of us. But tell me, shall I be frightened of such people, and leave the path of honesty?"" Amid reports of fake currency notes found floating in the Ganga at various locations in the State, Mr. Modi attacked those hoarding money, saying, “You sinners! Your sins will not be washed away by immersing notes in the Ganga.” While accusing Pakistan of supplying fake currency to support Naxalism and terrorism in India, he asked, “Should we allow the enemies to make their move? I ask the leaders, in the fight against terrorism and Naxalism, should we not terminate fake currency?” Mr. Modi recalled the promise he made to the people during the Lok Sabha elections that he would fight corruption, saying his step was only an attempt to fulfill it. “Should I not do what you asked me to do, end corruption? Am I not doing your work if I scrap notes of Rs 500 and Rs 1000? When the villagers are ready to face such hardships, it shows there is no place for the dishonest in India.” Mr. Modi also accused his opponents of instigating household women through “rumours that he had taken away all their savings for their daughter’s marriages."" He assured them they would not be bothered by the IT department. “My mothers and sisters, till your brother [Modi], is alive, you must be assured that no government officer will be put an eye on your hard-saved money.” Printable version | Jan 7, 2017 1:15:28 AM | http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/Demonetisation-has-equalised-the-rich-and-the-poor-claims-Modi/article16447877.ece © The Hindu Be it nature’s fury or man’s folly, destructions are alike.

232,2016-11-14,7.0,Demonetisation: Modi says the poor are with him,"Prime Miniter Narendra Modi flagging off new express train from Ghazipur city to Kolkata (through video conferencing) at Varanasi on Monday.   As he stressed that the poor strongly backed his decision to demonetise currency notes, Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday questioned the moral authority of his political opponents, especially the Congress, in criticising his step as anti-poor and anti-common man.  He invoked the Emergency days under former PM Indira Gandhi, accusing the Congress of enforcing it to only “save Ms. Gandhi’s seat.”  In contrast, Mr. Modi asserted, his decision to scrap notes of high demonetisation was taken in the “interest and happiness of the poor,” the good of the country and the farmer.  ''The Congress is worried about people. They enforced Emergency and turned this nation into a jail for 19 months. They restrained newspapers and arrested people who spoke up. Did you do this to fight corruption and the welfare of people?  You did it only to save the throne of your PM, Indira Gandhi,” Mr. Modi said. Addressing a parivartan rally in eastern Uttar Pradesh’s Ghazipur a day after his emotional speech in Goa, the PM reiterated his appeal to people to lend him time, 50 days, and patience to complete the “big task,” a “mahayagna of honesty,” of unearthing black money. He hinted that a door-to-door operation against black money would have taken years and stressed he was left with only “one solution,"" — scrapping notes of Rs 500 and Rs 1000. As he tried to justify his decision as ‘pro-poor,’ and gather public support, he said the demonetisation had equalised the rich and the poor. His government stood for the “for the poor, the villages and the farmers.” “India has no shortage of wealth but where is this wealth stored that is a problem. There is little where it is supposed to be, and it is hoarded at places where it should not be.” The PM, addressing his first rally in poll-bound UP after the mega overhaul, acknowledged the common citizen faced hardship due to the sudden scrapping of high denomination notes. He said he could “experience the suffering” of the “average honest citizen” and was staying up all night, using his “mind and power” to reduce the hardship and would continue to do so.   He promised he would not allow the “money of the poor to be looted.”   Urging people to bear the distress for a few days, he equated the situation as similar to a family’s tolerance of the pungent smell of wall paint for the larger good of decorating the house for a marriage.  There is discomfort in whatever you do, only the “intention behind it must be well-meaning,” he said, to assuage the anxiety of common people whose lives have been sent for a toss due to the crisis in supply of legal tender. Pushing the point, Mr. Modi referred to his own background as a tea-seller. “My decision is kadak (strong). When I was a child, the poor would especially ask me to make kadak chai. The poor is fond of kadak chai. I have a habit since childhood of making kadak chai. The kadak tea suits the poor but warps the expression of the rich,” the PM said.

In a departure from his teary-eyed address in Goa, the PM disparaged the Congress for asking under which law he had scrapped the notes, reminding them of previous Congress government’s decision to do away with the 25 paise. “What law did you apply then? Whom did you ask? It is another matter you cannot think beyond the 25 paise. You did something of your level, while we worked according to our level,” Mr. Modi said. The PM dared “all leaders misleading the people in the name of honesty” to show guts and publicly declare “if notes of Rs. 500 and Rs. 1000, corruption, black money and dishonesty should continue?” Mr. Modi asked people if he should be frightened by powerful forces hurt by his decision, even as he reiterated he would have to face consequences for it.  “I know what I will have to face because those whose coffers are full are powerful. They can buy governments and even bring them down. They can destroy fates of the best of us. But tell me, shall I be frightened of such people, and leave the path of honesty?"" he said. Amid reports of old currency notes found floating in the Ganga at various locations, Mr. Modi attacked those hoarding money, saying, “You sinners!

Am I not doing your work if I scrap notes of Rs. 500 and Rs. 1000?  Will you face the hardships and suffering that come with it? When the villagers are ready to face such hardships, there is no place for the dishonest in India.” Minutes before the rally, the PM, accompanied by Railway Minister Suresh Prabhu and his colleague and local MP, Manoj Sinha, flagged off the new Shabd Bhedi Express Train between Ghazipur and Kolkata and laid the foundation stone of the Ghazipur-Ganga rail bridge, a demand from the time of Nehru. Mr. Modi said he deliberately picked November 14, the first prime minister’s birthday, to launch the projects to highlight the Congress’ indifference towards impoverished Purvanchal.  “I deliberately picked November 14 to come here, so that on his birthday people who are misleading people know that from 1962 to 2016 you did not turn an eye to the region. Wherever your soul rests, Panditji, the aspirations of these poor people were locked away in papers and files after you went away. Even if your party and family throws false allegations on me, on your birthday I want to finish that incomplete work.” Mr. Modi invoked Nehru referring to an emotional speech made in Parliament in 1962 by Ghazipur ‘s then MP Vishwanath Gahmari to draw the then PM’s attention to the abject poverty of Purvanchal.  Consequently, Nehru had formed the Patel Committee, which outlined the necessary developments needed in the region. However, nothing came of it, Mr. Modi lamented.  “PMs came and went. I am the ninth from the State but nothing happened of that report,” Mr . Modi said as he pitched his government’s crop insurance scheme, AIIMS and fertilizers plants in Gorakhpur as “honest thought” towards the development of the region, among the most backward in the country.  Mr. Modi also accused his opponents of instigating household women through “rumours that he had taken away all their savings for their daughter’s marriages,” while assuring them they would not be bothered by the IT department.  “My mothers and sisters, till your brother [Modi], is alive, you must be assured that no government officer will be put an eye on your hard-saved money. Deposit your money without any worry. My government will even provide you interest for the marriage of your child. The Income Tax department will not bother you at all about your Rs 2.5 lakh. But should I spare those who with Rs 2.5 crore, those who hide stacks of notes under their bed and gunny bags?''   Printable version | Jan 7, 2017 1:15:31 AM | http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/Demonetisation-Modi-says-the-poor-are-with-him/article16386098.ece © The Hindu Be it nature’s fury or man’s folly, destructions are alike.

235,2016-11-14,7.0,"Demonetisation will have positive implications, says CII","Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) has welcomed demonetisation of the existing Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,000 notes saying this will have positive implications and bring about the much-needed transparency. According to a press release from the CII, “After a short period of some pain when the economy adjusts to the sudden withdrawal of cash, the CII expects a much stronger economy.” The prevalence of cash use had made India prone to high inflation. India’s cash dependence is extremely high with a currency-GDP ratio of nearly 12 per cent compared to four per cent to five per cent in other developing countries. High level of cash usage tends to slow down the flow of money through the economy. Lower cash use will have a dampening impact on inflation and this will be a positive for India’s macro fundamentals. Deposit mobilisation of banks will be strengthened and this will increase the liquidity for banks. “For the industry, this is indeed a historic and welcome move with very positive implications. It will prevent people from violating the law with impunity even for daily business transactions,” the CII said. K. Kathirmathiyon, secretary of Coimbatore Consumer Cause, says the inconvenience faced by the public is temporary. The public should use their bank accounts to deposit and withdraw cash (every individual customer can withdraw Rs. 20,000 a week). ATM cards can be used at almost all points of sale, including petrol bunks, he said.

  Prime Minister Narendra Modi held a meeting with senior ministers past midnight on Monday to review demonetisation and its impact. The meeting at Prime Minister’s residence was attended by Home Minister Rajnath Singh, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley, I&B Minister Venkaiah Naidu, Power, Coal and Mines Minister Piyush Goyal and top officials of the Finance ministry. The meeting came amid continuing chaos and growing public anger across the country over limited cash availability following the surprise demonetisation of two higher value currency notes by Modi. There was little respite for cash-starved people queueing up outside banks and ATMs on Sunday, with branches witnessing unprecedented rush since early morning and leading to arguments and scuffles. Earlier in the evening, after a review by Finance ministry, the limit of old and now defunct Rs 500 and Rs 1000 rupee notes that can be exchanged for freshly minted Rs 2000 and new Rs 500 notes was increased from Rs 4000 to Rs 4500 per day. Cash withdrawal limit at ATMs was hiked to Rs 2,500 from Rs 2,000 a day. The weekly limit of Rs 20,000 for withdrawal from bank counters has been increased to Rs 24,000. The maximum limit of Rs 10,000 per day on such withdrawals has been removed, the ministry said in a statement.

238,2016-11-14,7.0,Parliament storm brewing over demonetisation,"Demonetisation is set to dominate the winter session of Parliament beginning on November 16, with President Pranab Mukherjee agreeing to hear Opposition delegations, either on Wednesday or Thursday, on the issue. Lok Sabha Speaker Sumitra Mahajan has called the customary all-party meet on Monday. Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee spoke to President Mukherjee over phone on the issue, and tweeted that she had briefed him about how common people are suffering because of demonetisation. I thank him for agreeing to meet representatives of political parties on November 16 or 17 when we will brief him in detail over the grim situation.” The Trinamool Congress, Ms. Banerjee’s party, seems to have taken the lead in opposing demonetisation, with its Rajya Sabha member Derek O’Brien sending a notice for a discussion on the issue in the Upper House. She took what is seen as an unprecedented step in calling up arch political rival Communist Party of India (Marxist) general secretary Sitaram Yechury to canvass support. With the Parliament session set to begin on Wednesday, nearly a week after the decision to demonetise currency notes of the denominations Rs. 500 and Rs. 1000, this is being seen as an important issue on which the Opposition would attempt to corner the government. The government appeared sanguine at the prospects of a heated winter session. “The government has no hesitation in discussing any issue that the Opposition may choose to raise,” said Minister of State for Parliamentary Affairs Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi. He criticised the Trinamool and other parties opposing demonetisation. “If the government has taken such a strong measure against black money, shouldn’t other political parties unite in support of it instead of uniting to oppose it?” he said.

239,2016-11-14,7.0,Currency rush eases; business still down,"The rush to exchange high value currency notes, demonetized Tuesday night, appeared to have eased a little in the city though long queues were spotted at some of the bank branches even as many of the automatic teller machines (ATMs) remained closed or did not have money throughout the day. Retail business, including those in the market hub of Broadway, remained slack and many of them did not open for business on Sunday. The worst hit group in the city appeared to be workers from other States. One of the longest queues in the city was before the Menaka branch of the State Bank of India, where people formed a long queue even before the banking hours. Queues were also spotted at Thripunithura and near Vyttila in the city. A banker in the city said the rush for currency exchange continued unabated in some of the branches in the morning hours on Sunday on cue that Monday would be a holiday on account of Guru Nanak Jayanti. However, bankers have clarified that Monday would not be a holiday. Compared to the previous two days, “it was a manageable crowd on Sunday”, said another banker, who felt that the rush would ease with another couple of working days. He indicated that currency replenishment was expected and the situation would be easy. A State Bank of Travancore official said around 1,500 ATMs directly managed by the bank worked without cash running out on Sunday. Meanwhile, business at small retail outlets, eateries, transport and other service sector units continued to be slack on Sunday on account of the shortage of small denomination currency notes. The Ernakulam vegetable market was virtually deserted on Sunday while business was slack at other centres. General secretary of Ernakulam Market Stall Owners’ Association N. H. Shameed said small businesses were the worst hit by the Union government’s decision on high denomination currency notes. The Rs.2,000 notes available now posed a big problem as small change was scarce, he said. He also said if the situation continued and small change was not available, the market stall owners would join the strike declared by the Kerala Vyapari Vyavasayi Ekopana Samithi from Tuesday.

  The scrapping of ₹ 500 and ₹ 1,000 notes has come in handy for temples here to mop up more donations from devotees. But those sitting outside the temples for alms are clueless on exchanging these obsolete notes as they do not have Aadhaar or any other identity cards. “Whatever little savings we have made are in the form of some higher denomination notes to fall back during health and other emergencies,” say a group of beggars waiting outside the Siva temple at Chennakeshavaswamipet here. The shopkeepers selling puja material including coconuts and flowers are also in an uneviable position as most of the devotees come with either obsolete ₹ 500 or ₹1,000 notes or the newly-introduced ₹ 2,000 notes. “As a result, we are finding it too difficult to do business since Wednesday,” complained a shopkeeper Sridevi outside the Santhapeta Sai Baba temple.. However, some smaller temples have opened the hundi (donation box) to keep ready currency notes of various denominations to satisfy the devotees,who come with high value notes for various temple services like special pujas to Lord Siva on the auspicious Karthika masam. “We do not disappoint those devotees coming with outdated notes to give donations to the temple,” Krishna Swamy, member of the Devasthanam Board which administers the Ayyappa temple abutting the Rangarayaducheruvu here, says while giving a backdated receipt to a devotee who has chipped in with his contribution for ‘Annadanam’ programme at the temple coinciding with Makaravillaku-Jyothi Sabarimala pilgrim season. Meanwhile, Ms. Adilakshmi, a beggar sitting outside the Vijayadurga temple, was literally in tears as all that she has as life’s saving is some ₹ 500 notes. “We do not have any bank account or Aadhaar card. The government should come to our rescue,” adds Narasimhan, another beggar unable to reconcile with the Centre’s decision to do away with ₹ 500 and ₹ 1,000 notes.

241,2016-11-14,7.0,When demonetisation did not whip up a storm,"“Nobody had that kind of money [high denomination notes of Rs.10,000, Rs. 5,000 and Rs.1,000] when demonetisation happened in 1978. It did not affect us directly. The working class carried on without any problem. The kind of money that was taken off circulation was something that only families of industrialists had at that point. Currency notes of Rs.1,000 were a rarity in the hands of the common man. Back then, salaries and savings didn’t amount to the currency that was demonetised,” said 80-year-old Lakhbir Singh, an ex-government employee, talking about the 1978 demonetisation move. Mr. Singh said that daily life — buying daily provisions, travel, paying rent, school fee, etc. — had carried on seamlessly. “It would not be wrong to say that normal life carried on smoothly. There was no problem for the general public as a whole,” he added. He did say that this time, though the move was welcome, it had hit the common man the hardest. “I see people waiting in long lines outside banks and post offices, and these don’t seem to be getting shorter. The transition has hit the common man and his daily life has been disturbed. My son, who works in the public relations field, was asked to take advance payments in cash [old currency notes], which put him in a fix. I would say that comparing the two phases wouldn’t be fair. We hope, however, that the long-term benefits reach the common man,’’ he added. Seventy-nine-year-old Promilla Tuli, who ran a garments factory back in 1978, recalled that demonetisation then had not affected her business. “I remember hearing that the government had abolished high-value notes, but it didn’t matter to us. We never had those notes; we didn’t feel the need for it,” she said. In fact, many old-timers say that most people were not affected the last time the government experimented with demonetisation as the amount of high-value notes in circulation was quite less. The average citizen did not feel the pinch as these notes accounted for about 10 per cent of the money in circulation. This time, however, the government has withdrawn Rs.1,000 and Rs.500 notes, which account for over 85 per cent of the money, causing all sections of society being hit hard.

242,2016-11-14,7.0,Demonetisation: Business correspondents under pressure,"With the demonetisation of Rs. 500 and Rs.1000 notes, the Business Correspondents (BCs) of the banks “are under pressure”. They are facing challenges such as non-availability of cash and UV lamps to detect counterfeit notes. The Central government allowed the BCs to exchange notes up to Rs. 4000 per person against valid identity proofs and requisition slips. But a majority of the banks could not provide enough cash to them. Many banks, industry sources say, focus more on urban areas. Their attention is more on exchange of old notes and replenishment of cash in the ATMs in cities and towns leading to problems for the BCs. The banks have begun distributing cash to them on Saturday, sources say. “They are doing a good job. But they are under pressure,” said an SBI official, who did not want to be named. Another major reason is the norm that a BC is not supposed to hold more than Rs. 50,000. Even if a BC does a business over and above the cash holding limit, he or she has to deposit it with the bank branch concerned. So, the BC has to run to the bank as soon as he touches Rs. 50,000 business and return to his village to continue the transactions. “There is not much inconvenience. The BCs are remitting the amount in branches attached to them after 10 to 15 transactions have been done. There is pressure on branches also,” said a senior official of Andhra Bank. Some banks like the Indian Bank conducted a training session to the BCs on the modalities and precautions. The BCs had been told to maintain separate registers containing names and other details of account holders exchanging the notes. “This will help them in zeroing in on the person who might deposit counterfeit notes,” said an Indian Bank official. There are around 6,500 BCs working for various banks in AP. About half of 1,800 BCs of the Andhra Bank are located in AP alone. There are about 8,000 sub-service areas, meaning they do not sustain a brick-and-mortar branch. Therefore, banks chose BCs as the next possible alternative to serve the people there. A majority of the banks haven’t provided UV lamps and machines to detect the counterfeit notes.

243,2016-11-14,7.0,Parliament storm brewing over demonetisation,"Demonetisation is set to dominate the winter session of Parliament beginning on November 16, with President Pranab Mukherjee agreeing to hear Opposition delegations, either on Wednesday or Thursday, on the issue. Lok Sabha Speaker Sumitra Mahajan has called the customary all-party meet on Monday. Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee spoke to President Mukherjee over phone on the issue, and tweeted that she had briefed him about how common people are suffering because of demonetisation. I thank him for agreeing to meet representatives of political parties on November 16 or 17 when we will brief him in detail over the grim situation.” The Trinamool Congress, Ms. Banerjee’s party, seems to have taken the lead in opposing demonetisation, with its Rajya Sabha member Derek O’Brien sending a notice for a discussion on the issue in the Upper House. She took what is seen as an unprecedented step in calling up arch political rival Communist Party of India (Marxist) general secretary Sitaram Yechury to canvass support. With the Parliament session set to begin on Wednesday, nearly a week after the decision to demonetise currency notes of the denominations Rs. 500 and Rs. 1000, this is being seen as an important issue on which the Opposition would attempt to corner the government. The government appeared sanguine at the prospects of a heated winter session. “The government has no hesitation in discussing any issue that the Opposition may choose to raise,” said Minister of State for Parliamentary Affairs Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi. He criticised the Trinamool and other parties opposing demonetisation. “If the government has taken such a strong measure against black money, shouldn’t other political parties unite in support of it instead of uniting to oppose it?” he said.

244,2016-11-14,7.0,Demonetisation was a surgical strike on common man: Moily,"Calling the demonetisation of currency in the denomination of Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,000 a surgical strike on the common man, the former Union Minister M. Veerappa Moily has said that the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) government has given a big blow to economy and business has come to a standstill in the country. Speaking to The Hindu on the sidelines of a training session organised by the Karnataka Media Academy for journalists on covering the Assembly session, here on Saturday, he said that it was doubtful whether the exercise would reduce black money. “The BJP had actually promised to bring back the black money stashed in foreign banks. Instead, it has banned currency in the denomination of Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,000. Does the NDA government now believe that the people who are carrying currency in these denomination and waiting in long queues to get that changed have ill-gotten and black money,” he asked. About the Uniform Civil Code, Mr. Moily said the NDA government was raising the issue in view of the of Assembly elections in Uttar Pradesh. He asserted that in a pluralistic country like India, it was not possible to bring in a Uniform Civil Code. “When the Constitution guarantees freedom of religion, how can the government bring in a law which goes against the aspirations of the Constitution,” Mr. Moily said. On the delaying in appointing judges, he said that the NDA government was trying to destabilise the judicial system. Mr. Moily said that in the absence of judges, pending cases were piling up in courts.

245,2016-11-14,7.0,"Currency exchange: Villagers bogged down by fear, ignorance","Driven by their ignorance of how the banking system functions and traumatised by fears that their hard-earned ‘white’ money could be usurped have forced illiterate villagers in many parts of the State to hold on to their Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,000 notes. C. Pinnayi, who had previously served as a ward member of Paapapatti panchayat, said that some of the women in her village, out of panic, took photocopies of the Rs. 500 notes they had as a precautionary measure. “The sudden announcement (of demonetisation) created a lot of panic. There was fear that once they deposited the cash at the bank or post office for exchange, they will not be given new currencies immediately. So, they assumed that the photocopies will serve as a proof, if the situation demanded, that they actually possessed these currencies,” she said. Ms. Pinnayi added she was also worried about her son’s wedding slated on November 20. “I have borrowed from moneylenders to redeem gold jewellery pawned in a co-operative bank. However, officials there say they were yet to receive instruction on whether they can accept the cash,” she said. V.R. Muthu Peyandi, a farmer who also runs a small grocery shop in Pullaneri, said that many people in the village approached him seeking help to deposit their cash in his bank account and return in new currencies. “Though many have bank accounts, banks, like government offices, frighten them. They mostly rely on Banking Correspondents in the village to get their MGNREGA scheme wages and rarely go to banks. Moreover, when many elderly people still use thumb impressions, the banks are giving the withdrawal slips in English,” he pointed out. “With the present limits on amount that can be withdrawn, I am not able to help many,” he said, adding that for the past two days, people had been buying vegetable and rice from his shop on the promise that they will pay later. T. Socrates, a 55-year-old farmer from Paapapatti, said that his elderly mother, who had Rs. 10,000 she has saved in her old trunk suitcase, gave it to him to exchange in a bank. “I will return the money to my mother. But I know many families where such savings of the elderly could get appropriated by the family members now,” he said. N. Mahalakshmi from Karuppayurani, who works as a maid in a few households in Madurai city, said that she had to plead with three of her employees to get Rs. 100 from each of them to take her son, who had fever, to the hospital on Friday. “I had two Rs. 500 notes. However, the local clinic and pharmacy did not accept it. My husband waited in the queue of a bank. But it was taking really long,” she said. Some of the women in villages like Chinnareddipatti and Siruvalai said that they were pooling their savings to be deposited in the account of the local self help group so that they can withdraw and share it among themselves later. R. Siva, a small landholding farmer from Nattamangalam, said he had trouble issuing wages to those working in his land. “For instance, the wage for a person weeding one acre of land is Rs. 500. But the workers, predominantly middle-aged and elderly women who depend on their daily wages, hesitate to accept Rs. 500 notes (which has ceased to be legal tender),” he said.

246,2016-11-14,7.0,Demonetisation effect: Tourism sector takes a hit in Karnataka,"Small traders in Bengaluru’s K.R. Market area, which is usually teeming with people, have been seeing poor business in the last few days.   Buses running empty and hotels not having enough visitors even during what is considered the peak tourist season has become the norm ever since high-denomination notes were demonetised last week. The State tourism industry is reporting huge losses: while private tourist taxi operators estimate a 50 per cent drop in business, the Karnataka State Road Transport Corporation (KSRTC) and Karnataka State Hotels and Restaurants Association claim that business has dipped by 25 to 30 per cent over the last few days. Rajender Kumar Kataria, managing director, KSRTC, said direct bookings had dropped by 25 per cent. However, online ticket reservations have seen a drop of about 10 per cent. “During weekdays we get revenue of Rs. 7.25 crore, while weekends fetch us over Rs. 8 crore,” he said, and added that weekend business was down by Rs. 1 crore. During November and December, nearly 95 per cent of the KSRTC’s 8,400-odd fleet strength hits the road because of an increase in the number of tourists from and to Bengaluru. However, in the last few days, they have been operating fewer buses. “Usually during weekends over 25,000 tickets are booked from and to Bengaluru from places such as Tamil Nadu, Kerala and Andhra Pradesh. This weekend, it dropped to 20,000,” Mr. Kataria said. Meanwhile, R.K. Holla, president, Bangalore Tourist Taxi Operators’ Association, said that people were not able to withdraw money from ATMs because of which there had been a drastic drop in the number of tourists visiting hills stations and pilgrimage spots in Karnataka and the neighbouring States. Mr. Holla explained that owing to the lack of cash, even drivers were reluctant to go on long trips. “All of them do not have bank accounts because of which they have have not been able to draw money to give change. Since the process of getting inter-State permit has not gone online still, they are not able to pay cash and get them. Besides, the drivers usually have food at roadside eateries that do not accept card payment. All these factors put together has impacted our business,” he said. Checks on those making bulk bookings KSRTC managing director Rajender Kumar Kataria has instructed his staff to run checks on organisations making bulk bookings before accepting the order. Often, private and political parties book over 50 buses for functions. However, over the last 48 hours, KSRTC has received three such bulk bookings from organisations, and officials suspect that it’s a money laundering gimmick. Such bulk bookings usually cost over Rs 1 crore. “For this, customers have to provide a deposit amount running to lakhs of rupees. This can be ‘black’ money and when they cancel it in a few days, we will have to return it,” said a KSRTC official. To prevent this, the managing director has asked his staff to consult the head office before cancelling bulk bookings.

248,2016-11-14,7.0,Demonetisation hits students hard in Hassan,"Students from professional colleges, who have come to the State from different parts of the country, are facing a cash crunch because of the Union government’s decision to demonetise currency in the denominations of Rs. 1,000 and Rs. 500. These students do not have cash on hand nor are able to withdraw money from ATM kiosks, as most of the machines are not functioning in Hassan city. The students have been forced to take loans from friends, shopkeepers or distant relatives. Hundreds of students from Malnad College of Engineering on Salagame Road in Hassan, belong to far off places. They have opened savings bank accounts into which their families send money regularly. “My father had sent me money earlier this month. I withdrew the money and paid it to our house owner for rent. Now I need money for my daily expenses, that include food, travel and study material. I do not have any cash on hand and none of the ATMs near the college are working. I don’t know what to do,” said Ullas K., from Dakshina Kannada, who is in his final semester of B.E.. Pramod and Karthik, two other students, who are also roommates, are facing a problem too. They had borrowed money and cleared the rent in the first week of the month. “We paid our rent with Rs. 500 notes well before they were withdrawn. Now, the owner has returned the money and is asking us to pay the rent in Rs. 100 notes, said Pramod, also a B.E. student. Except for a few ATM kiosks in the core area of Hassan city, all were closed even on Sunday. The students were seen moving from one ATM to another to check if cash had been loaded into the machines. Wherever cash was filled, the queue was long. Loans With no option left, students are approaching shopkeepers near the college to borrow a few hundred rupees as loans. An owner of a stationery shop near the college said he had loaned about Rs. 5,000 to students in the last three days. “They are all my regular customers. Some wanted Rs. 200 to Rs. 500. As they were out of options, they approached me for loans and I helped them,” said the shopkeeper. Queues The public stood in long queues to withdraw and deposit cash in their accounts on Sunday too. While the withdrawal of cash was discouraged in many banks owing to non-availability of cash, depositing cash was allowed. Argument Two youngsters, who had been standing in a queue in front of Haralahalli branch of State Bank of Mysore, came to blows after an argument over who should enter the bank first.

251,2016-11-14,7.0,Demonetisation comes as a blessing for GWMC,"The demonetisation by the Central Government has come as a blessing to the Greater Warangal Municipal Corporation (GWMC) as it collected over Rs 4 crore so far. With the Central Government allowing the local agencies to accept invalidated currency notes, people thronged the municipal corporation offices to relieve themselves of the Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,000 notes to make tax payments. The tax collection crossed Rs. 5 crore by the GWMC by Sunday afternoon.

With the time being extended till November 14, the corporation is expected to collect even more and this is the first time in its history. According to the in-charge commissioner, Shahid Masood, the corporation launched special drive to collect the pending property taxes and water tap charges from people in 58 divisions. Special counters were opened in two circles and at GWMC head office in addition to the eight existing counters which have been working till late hours. Meanwhile, the corporation also pressed into service 33 bill collectors equipped with billing machines to collect taxes on a door-to-door basis. The Mee Seva centres also saw large crowds that turned up to pay their utility bills. The in-charge commissioner said they might collect around Rs 9 crore towards property tax, water tax and trade license charge. They so far collected Rs 1.56 lakh towards penalties.

In fact, demonetisation is one of the recommendations forwarded by the SIT to the Union government,” said Justice Pasayat told reporters at Cuttack on Sunday. It is to be noted that Chairman of SIT on Black Money and former Judge of the Supreme Court of India, Justice MB Shah and Vice- Chairman Justice Pasayat had recently written to Union Finance Minister Arun Jaitley saying a few steps needed to be taken to ensure that people holding black money in cash were not able to convert it into white. In wake of demonetisation, the SIT had recommended thorough analysis of bank accounts receiving huge deposits and other bank accounts in which money disproportionate to average transactions would be deposited. Precaution should be taken so that jewellery shops would not absorb black money by way of purchase of ornaments, it had said. “We have also drawn the attention of Union Finance Minister highlighting the problem being faced by common people. We have asked him to take steps so that inconvenience faced by people does not linger further,” said Justice Pasayat. He admitted that majority of people having no black money were also facing hassles. He hoped the current phase would soon get over.

  The scarcity of bank notes caused by demonetisation of Rs.500 and Rs.1,000 notes has had an adverse effect on the fund collection for the Snehasparsam Project of Kozhikode District Panchayat’s Kidney Patients Welfare Society, held on Sunday. Though the organisers had announced willingness to accept the nullified notes, most people were not willing to give up the notes of lower denominations, said Snehasparsam project coordinator Sreeraj N. “We had started campaigning months ago and had conducted door-to-door canvassing many times. But the demonetisation was an unexpected hurdle that we could not overcome since it came at the last moment,” he said. The fund collection was held in all the 70 panchayats in the district and the municipalities other than Ramanattukara and Vadakara on Sunday. Though there was a provision to deposit online into the Snehasparsam account, the outcome was low since online banking is not very popular in the rural areas. “Many people did not have money with them as they were either jobless or had not received payment from their employers due to scarcity of currency,” Mr. Sreeraj said. On the other hand, there were people who had set aside the sum for Snehasparsam much before the demonetisation came into effect. “The neighbourhood groups that had contributed up to Rs.27,000 last year had only collected up to Rs.7,000 this time,” he said. The organisers are expecting the financial crisis to be toned down by November 27 when the fund collection is to take place in Kozhikode Corporation, Vadagara and Ramanattukara municipalities. An executive meeting of the society to be held on Monday will discuss whether the collection in rural areas has to be extended, Mr. Sreeraj added.

254,2016-11-14,7.0,Currency rush eases; business still down,"The rush to exchange high value currency notes, demonetized Tuesday night, appeared to have eased a little in the city though long queues were spotted at some of the bank branches even as many of the automatic teller machines (ATMs) remained closed or did not have money throughout the day. Retail business, including those in the market hub of Broadway, remained slack and many of them did not open for business on Sunday. Migrant workers hit The worst hit group in the city appeared to be workers from other States. One of the longest queues in the city was before the Menaka branch of the State Bank of India, where people formed a long queue even before the banking hours. Queues were also spotted at Thripunithura and near Vyttila in the city. A banker in the city said the rush for currency exchange continued unabated in some of the branches in the morning hours on Sunday on cue that Monday would be a holiday on account of Guru Nanak Jayanti. However, bankers have clarified that Monday would not be a holiday. ‘Manageable crowd’ Compared to the previous two days, “it was a manageable crowd on Sunday”, said another banker, who felt that the rush would ease with another couple of working days. He indicated that currency replenishment was expected and the situation would be easy. A State Bank of Travancore official said around 1,500 ATMs directly managed by the bank worked without cash running out on Sunday. Business down Meanwhile, business at small retail outlets, eateries, transport and other service sector units continued to be slack on Sunday on account of the shortage of small denomination currency notes. The Ernakulam vegetable market was virtually deserted on Sunday while business was slack at other centres. General secretary of Ernakulam Market Stall Owners’ Association N. H. Shameed said small businesses were the worst hit by the Union government’s decision on high denomination currency notes. The Rs.2,000 notes available now posed a big problem as small change was scarce, he said. He also said if the situation continued and small change was not available, the market stall owners would join the strike declared by the Kerala Vyapari Vyavasayi Ekopana Samithi from Tuesday.

255,2016-11-14,7.0,?Demonetisation will have positive implications?,"Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) has welcomed demonetisation of the existing Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,000 notes saying this will have positive implications and bring about the much-needed transparency. According to a press release from the CII, “After a short period of some pain when the economy adjusts to the sudden withdrawal of cash, the CII expects a much stronger economy.” The prevalence of cash use had made India prone to high inflation. India’s cash dependence is extremely high with a currency-GDP ratio of nearly 12 per cent compared to four per cent to five per cent in other developing countries. High level of cash usage tends to slow down the flow of money through the economy. Lower cash use will have a dampening impact on inflation and this will be a positive for India’s macro fundamentals. Deposit mobilisation of banks will be strengthened and this will increase the liquidity for banks. “For the industry, this is indeed a historic and welcome move,” the CII said.

The Union Minister for Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises appealed to the public to lend their support to the scheme aimed at fighting terrorism, black money, corruption and fake currency. “I can understand the sufferings of the people and I even apologise for that. But I will ask them to lend their support to the Narendra Modi-led NDA government in this fight against terrorism, black money, fake currency and corruption to strengthen our nation,” he said. He appealed to the Reserve Bank of India and banks to make special arrangements for those in need of money for medical purpose and marriage. He said: “I would make all efforts to apprise the Union Finance Minister (Arun Jaitley) about people’s problems and to work for solving those issues. I would try to meet and urge him to extend the date of scrapping of such notes and increase cash exchange amount at banks from the present Rs 4,000 limit.” Taking a jibe at Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi who joined a queue to exchange Rs 4,000 at a bank in Delhi, Mr. Mishra said: “His family - Sonia and Rajiv- never visited banks and their son was standing in queue. We can understand what he was doing there.” He also attacked the State government. “Uttar Pradesh CM Akhilesh Yadav doesn’t want development of the State so he and his machinery were obstructing the execution of the Central government’s development projects in the State,” he said.

Except for a few ATM kiosks in the core area of Hassan city, all were closed even on Sunday. The students were seen moving from one ATM to another to check if cash had been loaded into the machines. Wherever cash was filled, the queue was long. Loans With no option left, students are approaching shopkeepers near the college to borrow a few hundred rupees as loans. An owner of a stationery shop near the college said he had loaned about Rs. 5,000 to students in the last three days. “They are all my regular customers. Some wanted Rs. 200 to Rs. 500. As they were out of options, they approached me for loans and I helped them,” said the shopkeeper. Queues The public stood in long queues to withdraw and deposit cash in their accounts on Sunday too. While the withdrawal of cash was discouraged in many banks owing to non-availability of cash, depositing cash was allowed. Argument Two youngsters, who had been standing in a queue in front of Haralahalli branch of State Bank of Mysore, came to blows after an argument over who should enter the bank first.

In a statement here on Sunday, Mr. Suresh said that the Modi government had virtually pushed the people of the country into the streets. The demonstrations will be organised in a manner that will not affect the people reaching banks to exchange or deposit the scrapped notes or withdraw money.

259,2016-11-14,7.0,Demonetisation hits fishing industry hard,"The demonetisation of Rs.1,000 and Rs.500 currency notes has affected the fishing industry. Fishing operations have come to a grinding halt since Saturday. Edmund Thennavan, president, Tamil Nadu Fishermen Association, said not only fishing operations but its allied industries such as ice manufacturing and logistics had been affected. Before announcing the demonetisation move, the government should have given a breather to the public. Though the Centre had targeted black money holders, common people should not have been made to suffer like this, he said. J. Ashok, a fisherman, said his fish netted a couple of days ago remained unsold because of this sudden move. Many fishermen were helpless without cash. This situation had led to fall in seafood prices. Fish sold for Rs.500 before demonetisation were being sold for Rs. 300 now. Since traders were not willing to procure fish, they were pushed to the local market vendors at a lesser price. S. Xavier Vas, president, Thoothukudi Mechanised Boat Owners’ Association, said boat owners had been facing hardship as every boat required Rs.1.40 lakh for a sailing day to meet the expenses on diesel, oil, ice bars and labour. Since there was a ceiling on withdrawal of cash from banks, the required money could not be withdrawn. Hence, there was no other alternative but to suspend fishing. It had resulted in a loss of Rs.2 crore in foreign exchange to the government every day since seafood exports had been affected, he said. The local economy, which was largely based on the fishing industry, in Thoothukudi remained affected. As many as 230 mechanised boats remained anchored at the fishing harbour here. It was not certain whether fishing would resume on Monday, he said. R. Raj, secretary, Thoothukudi Country Boat Fishermen Association, said seafood auctioneers had been asked to procure seafood after paying one-fourth of the old currency notes, which were demonetised, and the rest with fresh currency notes until November-end. However, country boat fishermen would continue fishing, he said.

260,2016-11-14,7.0,Demonetisation was a surgical strike on common man: Moily,"M. Veerappa Moily
  Calling the demonetisation of currency in the denomination of Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,000 a surgical strike on the common man, the former Union Minister M. Veerappa Moily has said that the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) government has given a big blow to economy and business has come to a standstill in the country. Speaking to The Hindu on the sidelines of a training session organised by the Karnataka Media Academy for journalists on covering the Assembly session, here on Saturday, he said that it was doubtful whether the exercise would reduce black money. “The BJP had actually promised to bring back the black money stashed in foreign banks. Instead, it has banned currency in the denomination of Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,000. Does the NDA government now believe that the people who are carrying currency in these denomination and waiting in long queues to get that changed have ill-gotten and black money,” he asked. About the Uniform Civil Code, Mr. Moily said the NDA government was raising the issue in view of the of Assembly elections in Uttar Pradesh. He asserted that in a pluralistic country like India, it was not possible to bring in a Uniform Civil Code. “When the Constitution guarantees freedom of religion, how can the government bring in a law which goes against the aspirations of the Constitution,” Mr. Moily said. On the delaying in appointing judges, he said that the NDA government was trying to destabilise the judicial system. Mr. Moily said that in the absence of judges, pending cases were piling up in courts.

  The nation is yet to recover from jitters sent by Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s surprise address to the people on Tuesday announcing demonetisation of Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,000 currency notes, but the Madurai Bench of the Madras High Court has already created history by being the first in the country to hear, deliberate and dismiss a case against the Centre’s move that has earned both bouquets and brickbats. However, what made the Madurai Bench reject the case was a decision of the Supreme Court taken on August 9, 1996 by a four-judge Bench of Justices M.K. Mukherjee, Kuldip Singh, M.M. Punchhi, and N.P. Singh upholding the Constitutional validity of the High Denomination Bank Notes (Demonetisation) Act, 1978 enacted during the Prime Ministership of Morarji Desai to demonetise Rs. 1,000, Rs. 5,000 and Rs. 10,000 currencies. Section 2 (d) of the Act defined the term ‘high denomination bank notes’ to mean the three currency notes and Section 3 declared that on expiry of January 16, 1978 all high-denomination notes would, notwithstanding anything contained in Section 26 of the Reserve Bank of India Act 1934, ceased to be legal tender in payment or on account at any place. Section 4 of the Act prohibited transfer and receipt of the currencies from the specified date. Assailing the Act, the petitioners before the Supreme Court had contended that it violated their fundamental rights enshrined in Articles 19 (1) (f) and 31 of the Constitution. While the first Article recognised the right to acquire any property by lawful means, hold it and dispose of it freely, limited only by reasonable restrictions, the second Article provided that the State could acquire private property for a public purpose only on payment of compensation to the owner. Since Section 26 of the RBI Act cast a duty upon the bank to honour the obligation of accepting currencies issued by it as legal tender, it was contended that the Demonetisation Act extinguished the debts due from the RBI to the holders of high denomination notes and that such extinguishment of debts amounted to compulsory acquisition of property without payment of compensation which was mandatory under Article 31(2) of the Constitution. Rejecting the arguments, the apex court said the contention based on Article 19(1)(f ) was “wholly misconceived for after compulsory acquisition of their property by the impugned Act, the petitioners’ right thereto stood extinguished and consequently the question of reasonable restriction to the exercise or enjoyment of a right, which became non est, could not arise”. On the issue of compensating the holders of demonetised bank notes, the court said: “Equally untenable is the petitioners’ contention that they were deprived of their right to get compensation for such acquisition as Sections 7 and 8 of the Demonetisation Act lay down an elaborate procedure to apply for and obtain an equal value of the high denomination bank notes in the manner prescribed thereunder.” Taking a cue from that judgement, the Madurai Bench held: “Now Article 19(1)(f) is no more in force. Therefore, as of now, right to own property is no more a fundamental right. Similarly, Article 31 also stands supplemented by certain other provisions introduced. When the Honourable Supreme Court had declared that demonetisation of currency notes did not violate Article 19(1)(f), it is difficult for us to hold that it offends any other fundamental right.” A Division Bench of Justices S. Nagamuthu and M.V. Muralidaran also went on to state that the present petitioner who had challenged the recent decision to demonetise Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,000 notes had not made out any case, even prima facie, to show that the Finance Ministry’s notification under challenge was either illegal, irrational or it suffered from procedural impropriety or proportionality for the court to exercise judicial review. On the issue of hardship caused to the common man due to the sudden move, the judges said: “Of course, it is true that it has caused some inconvenience. As expressed by the Hon’ble Prime Minister of India, in his address to the nation, it is not as though the Government was not aware of these possible inconvenience or hardship to the common man and the poor people of this country. “His Excellency, the President of India, who himself is a great scholar, economist and who had held the portfolio of finance for a considerable time, has issued a Press Note wherein His Excellency has welcomed the said action taken by the Central Government, which, according to him, will help to unearth unaccounted money as well as counterfeit currency. “As it has been expressed by His Excellency the President of India and the Hon’ble Prime Minister of India, we, the people of this country, should be hopeful that this measure would speed up the growth of the economy.... and it would free the country from corruption, black money, terrorism and other evils,” the judges concluded.

262,2016-11-14,7.0,When demonetisation did not whip up a storm,"80-year-old Lakhbir Singh expressed hope that the long-term benefits would reach the people soon.photo: Special Arrangement
  “Nobody had that kind of money [high denomination notes of Rs.10,000, Rs. 5,000 and Rs.1,000] when demonetisation happened in 1978. It did not affect us directly. The working class carried on without any problem. The kind of money that was taken off circulation was something that only families of industrialists had at that point. Currency notes of Rs.1,000 were a rarity in the hands of the common man. Back then, salaries and savings didn’t amount to the currency that was demonetised,” said 80-year-old Lakhbir Singh, an ex-government employee, talking about the 1978 demonetisation move. Mr. Singh said that daily life — buying daily provisions, travel, paying rent, school fee, etc. — had carried on seamlessly. “It would not be wrong to say that normal life carried on smoothly. There was no problem for the general public as a whole,” he added. He did say that this time, though the move was welcome, it had hit the common man the hardest. ‘Common man hit hard’ “I see people waiting in long lines outside banks and post offices, and these don’t seem to be getting shorter. The transition has hit the common man and his daily life has been disturbed. My son, who works in the public relations field, was asked to take advance payments in cash [old currency notes], which put him in a fix. I would say that comparing the two phases wouldn’t be fair. We hope, however, that the long-term benefits reach the common man,’’ he added. Seventy-nine-year-old Promilla Tuli, who ran a garments factory back in 1978, recalled that demonetisation then had not affected her business. “I remember hearing that the government had abolished high-value notes, but it didn’t matter to us. We never had those notes; we didn’t feel the need for it,” she said. In fact, many old-timers say that most people were not affected the last time the government experimented with demonetisation as the amount of high-value notes in circulation was quite less. The average citizen did not feel the pinch as these notes accounted for about 10 per cent of the money in circulation. This time, however, the government has withdrawn Rs.1,000 and Rs.500 notes, which account for over 85 per cent of the money, causing all sections of society being hit hard. It didn’t matter to us.

  Even while the demonetisation has led to sharp fall in the arrival of tourists to Yercaud, it has also hit a large number of plantation workers employed in the big and small estates on the hill station. The non-availability of adequate currency of lower denomination, absence of adequate bank branches for the exchange of the scrapped currency and the non-functioning of the ATMs have hit the plantation workers in the form of non-disbursement of wages. Yercaud accounts for 67 tribal villages with a majority of the population employed as daily wagers in the coffee estates. The hill station has five bank branches and six ATMs. With ATMs not functioning, the queues at the bank branches are getting longer day by day. The plantation workers are paid wages once a week. With the government restricting the withdrawal to Rs. 10,000 and exchange limit to Rs. 4,000, the estate owners are not in a position to disburse small denomination currency to them. V. K. Nallamuthu, general secretary of the Indian Trade Union Congress (INTUC), while welcoming the initiative of the government, said its execution without proper planning had caused untold hardship to people. The workers and their families, who mainly depend on the wages for the day to day expenses, were badly hit. They were at present forced to approach money lenders, he added. With only a few big hotels accepting online transaction, the arrival of tourists here has decreased and the rooms in small hotels remained vacant. Mr. Nallamuthu pleaded with the banks to rush adequate lower denomination currency to the hill station, open more counters for the exchange of currency and make all the ATMs operational.

  The scrapping of Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,000 notes has come in handy for temples here to mop up more donations from devotees. But those sitting outside the temples for alms are clueless on exchanging these obsolete notes as they do not have Aadhaar or any other identity cards. “Whatever little savings we have made are in the form of some higher denomination notes to fall back during health and other emergencies,” say a group of beggars waiting outside the Siva temple at Chennakeshavaswamipet here. The shopkeepers selling puja material including coconuts and flowers are also in an uneviable position as most of the devotees come with either obsolete Rs. 500 or Rs. 1,000 notes or the newly-introduced Rs. 2,000 notes. “As a result, we are finding it too difficult to do business since Wednesday,” complained a shopkeeper Sridevi outside the Santhapeta Sai Baba temple.. However, some smaller temples have opened the hundi (donation box) to keep ready currency notes of various denominations to satisfy the devotees,who come with high value notes for various temple services like special pujas to Lord Siva on the auspicious Karthika masam. “We do not disappoint those devotees coming with outdated notes to give donations to the temple,” Krishna Swamy, member of the Devasthanam Board which administers the Ayyappa temple abutting the Rangarayaducheruvu here, says while giving a backdated receipt to a devotee who has chipped in with his contribution for ‘Annadanam’ programme at the temple coinciding with Makaravillaku-Jyothi Sabarimala pilgrim season. Meanwhile, Ms. Adilakshmi, a beggar sitting outside the Vijayadurga temple, was literally in tears as all that she has as life’s saving is some Rs. 500 notes. “We do not have any bank account or Aadhaar card. The government should come to our rescue,” adds Narasimhan, another beggar unable to reconcile with the Centre’s decision to do away with Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,000 notes.

265,2016-11-15,8.0,Demonetisation hits NBFC stocks,"Stocks of non-banking finance companies fell on Tuesday as a government bid to replace high denomination currencies from the system affected small businesses, which are mostly financed by the NBFCs. While the broader indices fell by about two per cent, the fall in NBFC shares was much sharper. Mortgage financier Can Fin Homes stock slumped 20 per cent while Manappuram Finance stock declined 16.6 per cent from their previous close. Some of the other NBFCs like Capital First (-13.6%) Edelweiss Financial (-9.5%), LIC Housing Finance (-7.7%), also felt the impact. A substantial number of NBFC customers are from semi-urban and rural areas, and the borrowers are transport operators, farmers, equipment hirers, small and medium enterprises and small traders, among others who mostly deal in cash. “The current round of demonetisation is likely to disrupt the small business ecosystem in the near term, as the segment operates largely in cash,” Kotak Securities said in a report. “We see challenging times for real estate, small businesses and CV finance.” ATM recalibration

Last week, the Centre banned Rs.500 and Rs.1000 denomination bank notes in a move to curb black money and said such notes can be exchanged at bank branches and post officer before December 30. The process of exchange and withdrawal of legal tenders have been slow with automated teller machines requiring re-calibration. NBFCs have also requested the Centre to allow them to accept such notes till December 30. “The borrowers’ business has been affected with no money circulation,” Finance Industry Development Council – the industry body for asset finance NBFCs said in a statement. “Because of the very nature of their trade and credit behaviour, if we don’t collect the available cash from the borrowers, it is most likely to roll forward to the next month, making it more difficult for them to repay. This may lead to loan defaults thereby adding stress to the overall asset quality.” Sensex sinks

The benchmark Sensex fell 514.19 points, or 1.92 per cent, to 26,304.63. The losses in the benchmark index were led by Tata Motors and the banking majors like Axis Bank, ICICI Bank and HDFC Bank. The broader Nifty of the National Stock Exchange (NSE) closed at 8,108.45, down 2.26 per cent or 187.85 points. Market participants attribute the fall to global cues along with concerns of an interim domestic slowdown on account of the Centre’s demonetisation move. The overall market was in the red with 2,354 declines as against only 346 gainers on BSE. All the sectoral indices - barring BSE IT - ended the day in negative territory.

Mr. Rajendran was speaking after the State-level inauguration of the party’s protests over the currency ban and the Central government’s alleged steps to destroy the cooperative sector, in front of the Reserve Bank headquarters in the capital city on Tuesday. “The Modi government has not taken any step to bring back the black money parked in foreign countries. Instead, it is trying to help black money holders convert it into white money. This declaration of war against the people is to hide its failings over the past two years.

(pic by S. Ramesh Kurup in Nica) KOZHIKODE: It was nearly 3 o’clock in the morning when T. Sethumadhavan Nair, assistant general manager, State Bank of Travancore, Kozhikode, left his office on November 10. Most of his colleagues too had stayed back: it was the first day since the banks opened for the public after Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s important speech on live television withdrawing the currency notes of Rs. 500 and 1000. On the previous day, the banks had not opened for the public, but the employees had worked hard, preparing for the after-effects of demonetisation, the magnitude of which was unprecedented in the country. Yet, they were not prepared for the frenzy and the panic the public displayed on November 10. “In my career of 36 years in banking, I have never seen anything like this,” said Sethumadhavan. “We had opened additional counters, but even that was not enough. Besides serving our own customers, my bank also has to supply the currency to 27 other banks in the city; so the load is enormous on our employees.” They have not taken a day off since November 9. “We do not even get time to have our lunch properly,” said N.L. Premalatha, who works at the Palayam branch of SBT. “But we have no complaints; we understand the difficulties of the common man.” A. Raghavan, a chief associate at the administrative office of the State Bank of India, Kozhikode, said many of the employees had even cancelled their leaves because of the crisis. “And we had to redeploy of our resources to ensure that the customers got their cash from the counters,” he said. “We stopped doing the back-office work, such as writing reports and opening new accounts, so that everyone could be assigned at the front office.” Besides handing out the cash, the employees also have had to assure the people that their money was safe in the bank. “At our branch, we have a lot of customers who are migrant labourers, from States like Bengal,” said Raghavan. “Most of them make remittances to their relatives back home. And some of them told us that they were exploited by the natives, who would give them currency notes worth 400 in exchange of the Rs. 500 note.” Sethumadhavan said he was expecting another busy week for bank employees like him. “But, we are willing to work like this,” he said.

Many pilgrims who talked to The Hindu here on Tuesday when the Ayyappa temple was opened for the two-month Mandalam-Makaravilakku pilgrimage season shared more or less the same thought. But, all of them said they had to struggle a lot to mobilise lower-denomination currency notes before embarking on their pilgrimage to Sabarimala. “Keeping more bundles of notes was another inconvenience we faced,’’ said another Guruswami from Karnataka. However, the traders at Pampa have reportedly started feeling the heat of the demonetisation. R. Ramachandran Nair, a hoteleer at Pampa, told The Hindu that shortage of lower-denomination currency was a major problem merchants of Sabarimala faced. Meanwhile, Dhanalakshmi Bank, the official bankers of the Travancore Devaswom Board, has opened special counters for currency exchange at Sabarimala Sannidhanam and at Pampa. P. Manikantan, Dhanalakshmi Bank general manager, said two ATMs had already been functioning at Sannidhanam and one at Pampa. The bank had arranged sufficient lower-denomination currency notes to meet the growing demand for the same at Sabarimala in the coming days. Mr. Manikantan said the bank was also exploring the possibility of installing more ATMs at Sabarimala, if the TDB allotted space for the same, and telecom connectivity.

While the broader indices fell by about two per cent, the fall in NBFC shares was much sharper. Mortgage financier Can Fin Homes stock slumped 20 per cent while Manappuram Finance stock declined 16.6 per cent from their previous close. Some of the other NBFCs like Capital First (-13.6%) Edelweiss Financial (-9.5%), LIC Housing Finance (-7.7%), also felt the impact. A substantial number of NBFC customers are from semi-urban and rural areas, and the borrowers are transport operators, farmers, equipment hirers, small and medium enterprises and small traders, among others who mostly deal in cash. “The current round of demonetisation is likely to disrupt the small business ecosystem in the near term, as the segment operates largely in cash,” Kotak Securities said in a report. “We see challenging times for real estate, small businesses and CV finance.” Last week, the Centre banned Rs.500 and Rs.1000 denomination bank notes in a move to curb black money and said such notes can be exchanged at bank branches and post officer before December 30. The process of exchange and withdrawal of legal tenders have been slow with automated teller machines requiring re-calibration. NBFCs have also requested the Centre to allow them to accept such notes till December 30. “The borrowers’ business has been affected with no money circulation,” Finance Industry Development Council – the industry body for asset finance NBFCs said in a statement. “Because of the very nature of their trade and credit behaviour, if we don’t collect the available cash from the borrowers, it is most likely to roll forward to the next month, making it more difficult for them to repay. This may lead to loan defaults thereby adding stress to the overall asset quality.” The benchmark Sensex fell 514.19 points, or 1.92 per cent, to 26,304.63. The losses in the benchmark index were led by Tata Motors and the banking majors like Axis Bank, ICICI Bank and HDFC Bank. The broader Nifty of the National Stock Exchange (NSE) closed at 8,108.45, down 2.26 per cent or 187.85 points. Market participants attribute the fall to global cues along with concerns of an interim domestic slowdown on account of the Centre’s demonetisation move. The overall market was in the red with 2,354 declines as against only 346 gainers on BSE. All the sectoral indices - barring BSE IT - ended the day in negative territory.

271,2016-11-15,8.0,Officials asked to study impact of demonetisation,"Chief Secretary Rajiv Sharma has directed the authorities of various State government departments to study the impact of demonetisation of higher denomination currency note on revenue collection in different sectors. At a review meeting conducted here on Tuesday, the Chief Secretary wanted senior officials -- Special Chief Secretaries K. Pradeep Chandra, S.P. Singh, M.G. Gopal, Ranjeev R. Acharya, Ajay Misra and S.K. Joshi, Principal Secretaries S. Narsing Rao, K. Ramakrishna Rao and Sunil Sharma, Inspector General of Police (Intelligence) Navin Chand and others to review the situation every day. Mr. Rajiv Sharma suggested them to hold meetings with the officials concerned to keep a tab on the impact of demonetisation by speaking to individual officers and organisations engaged in the exercise of revenue collection. He asked them to study and report on the long-term impact of the Centre’s decision on State revenue, particularly on the revenue collected during the first seven months of the financial years and the remaining five months in the backdrop of demonetisation. Further, the Chief Secretary reviewed the prospects of devolution of State’s share in taxes collected by the Centre, grants and flow of other funds so that a strategy could be prepared to tackle the situation. He discussed month-wise revenue collection from registrations, value added tax (VAT), excise, transport (motor vehicles) tax, non-tax revenue and monthly expenditure of the State government.

272,2016-11-15,8.0,CPI(M) attacks Centre on demonetisation,"A day before the winter session of Parliament begins, the CPI(M) attacked the Modi government and the BJP on demonetisation, “authoritarian tendencies” at the Centre and in BJP-ruled States and “communal polarisation.” “The withdrawal of Rs. 500 and Rs. 1000 currency notes has led to total disruption of the payments and settlements system and has impacted all citizens in one way or the other,” a party release said on Tuesday. “In rural areas, the crisis is grave. Markets are closed in various places. People are unable to buy even bare essentials, life-saving medicines etc.” The statement echoed party general secretary Sitaram Yechury’s view that the measure does not address black money, corruption, counterfeit currency notes and terror funding. “Cash constitutes only six per cent of the black economy,” the release said. “... Also, the basic avenues for money laundering through participatory notes and diversions through tax havens remain untouched. There is no attempt to curb the roots of generation of black money such as in the real estate sector.” “The Government of India/RBI should allow district and primary cooperative banks also to accept and exchange Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,000 notes. This will provide much relief to people in the rural areas.” The CPI(M) demanded that till alternative arrangements like the availability of required currency notes and the recalibration of ATM machines are completed, people should be allowed to transact in old notes. The party termed signs of authoritarianism incidents such as the bid to slap a ban on NDTV India, the detention of Rahul Gandhi, Arvind Kejriwal and others while trying to meet family members of a retired Army man who committed suicide, the Delhi police action on JNU students protesting the disappearance of student Najeeb Ahmad after a dispute with the ABVP, murder charges against Delhi professors, a CPI(M) State leader and others in Chhattisgarh, and the encounter of eight alleged SIMI undertrials in Madhya Pradesh. “The Polit Bureau expressed concern over the escalating communal tension and consequent polarisation in the run-up to the Uttar Pradesh Assembly elections,” the statement added. “The BJP and the RSS are vigorously pursuing this agenda through various outfits and propagating divisive issues like gau raksha etc,” the CPI(M) said.

273,2016-11-15,8.0,"High alert sounded at ports, airports to check smuggling of gold, currency","VIJAYAWADA: Officials of the Customs and Central Excise have sounded high alert at all airports and ports to check illegal transportation of currency and gold. With the cancellation of the Rs.500 and Rs.1000 notes, the Centre had taken steps to close the doors from all sides on black money. “Special teams have been deputed at Kakinada, Visakhapatnam, Krishnapatnam ports and the Inland Container Depot (ICD) located at Marripalem village in Guntur district. Likewise, security has been tightened at Gannavaram, Visakhapatnam, Rajahmundry and Renigunta airports too,” a senior Customs and Central Excise official told The Hindu. Officers had been asked to keep a tab on the foreign vessels and flights and screen the crew and the passengers thoroughly. “We are receiving many complaints on sale of gold. But the Customs Department will act only on the gold biscuits which are of foreign origin and which have foreign markings under Section 123 of Customs Act 1962. Customs and Central Excise do not have jurisdiction on Indian made gold and fine touch yellow metal,” said another officer of the Customs Department. However, we kept a vigil and the officials concerned had been instructed to focus on bullion traders, showrooms and money exchanging teams. The special teams would act on the complaints and the details of the informants would be kept confidential, the officer said. Anti-smuggling teams “We deal with smuggling of gold, foreign currency, cigarettes and some foreign goods. Anti-smuggling teams have been pressed into service along the coast as well as ports. We request the public to cooperate with the officials in checking smuggling,” the officer said. The Customs and Central Excise authorities were monitoring the situation and tightened vigil at all vantage points. “We are reviewing the position at airports and ports with the officers concerned,” the officer added.

274,2016-11-15,8.0,"Demonetisation unscientific, says YSRC","TIRUPATI: YSR Congress activists, led by party’s State general secretary Bhumana Karunakar Reddy, staged a demonstration at Gandhi Circle here on Tuesday in protest against the “unscientific” demonetisation exercise taken up by the Central government. Laying a siege to the main road leading to the RTC bus station, the party activists raised slogans against the Centre for “throwing life out of gear and causing serious dent to the nation’s economy.” Mr. Reddy said that the Centre should be held responsible for the loss of livelihood of the poor, loss of lives in hospitals for want of money, and imminent fall in the GDP due to the exercise. “Tens of thousands of man hours are wasted as people are made to stand in queues to exchange, deposit, and withdraw currency notes. The government should have thought of a hassle-free system before introducing the rule,” he said. While stating that party was not against the motto behind the exercise, Mr. Karunakar Reddy said they were against the “haphazard” manner in which it was taken up. He rebuked “Modi supporters” of muzzling criticism in the garb of nationalism and terming detractors as “anti-national.” He was later taken into custody by the Tirupati East police. Congress stages dharna Congress workers, led by former MP Chinta Mohan, too staged a dharna at Potti Sriramulu Circle near SVRR Government General Hospital. He took exception to the way the Central government was “playing” with the lives of the poor and middle class, while ignoring the super rich, who had actually hoarded unaccounted for money. Referring to the people running from pillar to post for exchanging their old currency notes, Dr. Mohan wondered if it was the “Acche Din” promised by Prime Minister Narendra Modi. “People across the country are suffering, but the Centre is blind to this fact. This government does not want to see the truth,” he charged. He was taken into custody for burning the effigy of the Prime Minister and was housed in the Alipiri police station.

275,2016-11-15,8.0,Demonetisation leaves rural economy paralysed,"Last weekend, several instances of panam payattu (also called kurikkalyanam) in Kozhikode, Malappuram and other north Kerala districts were cancelled. The reason — the scrapping of Rs.1,000 and Rs.500 notes. Panam Payattu is a traditional way of raising funds in the rural areas of these districts for building a house, marrying off a daughter or meeting a financial emergency. At the panam payattu  event, held at a pre-scheduled venue and time (usually on weekends) by the needy person, people chip in for the cause with contributions of Rs.500 or its multiples. Many of last weekend’s payattu events had to be cancelled because people had no money to give. This is one of the myriad examples of how the demonetisation of high value currency notes is fast paralysing the rural economy. “I haven’t gone fishing for the past three days,” says Chekhov of Chelannur in Kozhikode. “People don’t have cash with them to pay for my fish.” The 66-year-old Chekhov and his colleagues make a living by fishing in the Pavayil Puzha, a tributary of Korappuzha River. The scooter-borne fish vendors, who buy fish regularly from Chekhov, have not shown up ever since the high value notes were demonetised. While 1000s and 500s are invalidated, 100s and 50s are hard to come by. Lottery vendors and thattukada operators are among the worst-hit. An elderly lottery vendor at Atholi said he had hardly sold any tickets for the past five days. P. Uthaman of Kakkodi, a retired sub-registrar officer who is now a registered document writer, said a large network of people who made a living from the real estate sector were now in trouble. Registration of land, houses and flats had come down to a fourth as the stamp duty and the registration fee needed to be paid in hard currency. Only small transactions and registration of wills and leases were taking place. He said people in the rural areas who had hoped to get their land sold for meeting financial emergencies were tense. Artisans and semi-skilled workers, electricians and plumbers are all without an income now as people have postponed repairs to their houses. Cobblers, motorbike repairmen, mobile phone shop-owners, autorickshaw drivers and mini-lorry owners are underemployed. In the high-land areas of Kozhikode and Kannur districts, where small rubber plantations are aplenty, many rubber dealers’ shops remain shuttered as they don’t have the money to pay rubber producers. The economic paralysis triggered by demonetisation in the rural areas have made the people fear that the situation is only going to be worse.

276,2016-11-15,8.0,Demonetisation eats into Nanjangud temple?s revenue,"There has been a drastic decline in the revenue of the Srikanteshwara Temple at Nanjangud post the demonetisation of Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,000 currency last week. According to Jayaprakash, executive officer of the temple, the income of the temple has reduced by over 35 per cent on an average after the demonetisation move of the Union government. The demonetisation process has also had an impact on the number of devotees visiting the temple. There has been a 40 per cent decline in the number of devotees visiting the temple, Mr. Jayaprakash said. Mr. Jayaprakash told The Hindu that the average income of the temple is about Rs. 1.25 crore per month, that includes the sale of special entrance tickets, archana tickets and other religious rituals performed at the temple. But after the ban of higher denomination notes, there has been a sharp decline in the income and as well as number of visitors to the temple, he added. “Devotees are producing Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,000 notes for different sevas. The temple authorities have no other option but to refuse the Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,000 notes. The temple authorities are asking the devotees to give small denomination notes as religious institutions are not permitted to accept the banned notes,” Mr. Jayaprakash said. As a result, people who can afford to buy tickets for special entrance or special pooja stand in long queues for the darshan and this has resulted in the temple losing a major chunk of its income, Mr. Jayaprakash said. Over 3,500 to 4,000 people normally visit the temple on Sundays, Mondays and other auspicious days and at least 2,000 people visit the temple on other days on an average, he said. “Even dakshine to the arathi thatte has come down drastically,” he said. He said that the temple authorities were not aware of people putting bags of the now banned Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,000 notes into the temple hundis. However, he said that he will soon appeal to the Deputy Commissioner of the district to open the hundis in the last week of November to check if the banned notes had been put into them. Similarly, there has been a sharp decline in the income and the number of visitors to the Chamundeshwari Temple here.

277,2016-11-15,8.0,Demonetisation: SUCI activists protest in Mysuru,"The Socialist Unity Centre of India (SUCI) has questioned the demonetisation exercise of the Union Government to curb black money and described it as a futile endeavour. SUCI activists, who staged a demonstration here on Tuesday, said none of the big fishes with black money have been affected by demonetisation. The commoners and the honest tax-paying citizens are among the worst hit and are bearing the brunt of the Union government’s move, they said. They said similar demonetisation initiatives were taken up in 1946 and 1978 but they were not successful in curbing black money and SUCI averred that a similar outcome may be expected out of the current exercise as well. Individuals with unaccounted for money would have invested them on land, gold and other avenues and rarely hold on to cash and hence the move was affecting the poor and the middle class, they said. “Which political or business big wig is standing in a queue in front of banks and ATMs to withdraw their quota of Rs. 2,000 per day?” questioned SUCI activists. Daily wagers, both in rural and urban areas, are under stress owing to non-payment of wages in the absence of adequate currency notes. “The situation is grave in rural areas where banking network and penetration is low,” they added.

Mr. Sibal said the previous “demonetisation"" in 1978 only dealt with high denomination notes which only comprised two per cent of the currency value in circulation. Now, Rs. 500 and Rs. 1000 notes occupy 86 per cent of the currency value.

During his five-minute telephonic conversation with Mr. Modi, Mr. Prachanda told him that Nepalese have quite a big stock of Indian bank notes of 500 and 1,000 denominations that have now been pulled out of circulation. Hundreds of thousands of Nepalese, who earn a living by working as daily-wage labourers in India, visit the neighbouring country seeking medical treatment or rely on Indian markets to purchase daily essentials, are said to be holding big chunk of scrapped Indian bank notes, Kathmandu Post reported. Also, those visiting India as pilgrims and those engaged in cross-border trade are said to have a big stock of now-useless Indian bank notes. Some of these people, according to the Federation of Nepalese Chambers of Commerce and Industry, may lose their entire savings if the now-obsolete notes are not replaced with legal bills. “Considering this, India should make an arrangement so that Nepalese can exchange the banned notes here in Nepal,” a statement posted on Mr. Prachanda’s personal website quoted the premier as saying. In response, Mr. Modi said he would immediately resolve the issue and would also ask Finance Minister to hold talks with Nepalese counterpart. Following the Indian government’s surprise decision, the Nepal Rastra Bank (NRB), the central bank, also banned the use of those bank notes in Nepal from last Wednesday.

286,2016-11-15,8.0,Tourists bear the brunt of demonetisation,"Visitors enjoying a night view of the city from the vantage point at the popular tourist site atop Kailasagiri in Visakhapatnam.
  Rajkumar Chatterjee, a tourist from Kolkata, reached Visakhapatnam on November 9, for a week’s stay in the port city. Little did he know that a decision taken by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on the night of November 8, would jeopardise his week-long fun that he planned with his family. The demonetisation scheme has hit the tourists hard. Talking to The Hindu, he said, “I was carrying all Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,000 notes. And they turned into waste paper, as neither the hotels nor the taxi drivers or the restaurants for that matter, refused to take the currency, as they were no longer legal tender.” With great difficulty, he could get in touch with a common friend who helped him out with some change and exchange a few notes of Rs. 500. “My tour, which was planned for a lavish outing, has turned into rationed living,” he lamented. This has been the case with most of the tourists, who feel that they are stranded despite the government giving a clear instruction that tourists are exempted. The tourists are facing problem for minor things such as paying auto charges or buying gift articles from roadside stalls, as every tourist does, or for paying food bills at small eateries. “We have not encountered any problems in big malls, as there are card swiping machines. But not everybody can afford to do shopping at malls. And most importantly, this city is new to us and we are unable to exchange our notes at the ATM counters, as they are either not working or there is a big queue,” said Arup Sen, another tourist from Burdwan district in West Bengal. According to Sunit Kumar Panja of Nimantran Hotel, the tourist flow has suddenly died down. “Being a hotelier, we are in touch with most of the lodges and we understand that there are over 30 per cent cancellations. This is the beginning of the tourist season and if the trend continues then the business for this season is hit badly,” he said. Besides tourism, the flow from the city has also slowed down. According to the Welfare Group of Tours and Travels, there are about 10 per cent cancellation of outbound travel and those who are planning have indefinitely postponed their travel plans. “People do not want to take the risk, till things settle down,” said an executive of the tour company. Last year, the city of destiny recorded about 1.15 crores of tourist footfalls, which included about 69,000 foreign tourists. The tourism season is at its peak from October to January, which stood at about 40 lakhs of the 1.15 crores, which accounts for about 35 per cent in four months.

287,2016-11-15,8.0,Stalin hits out at CM for ?silence? on currency crunch,": DMK treasurer M.K. Stalin on Monday questioned the absence of reference to measures to tide over the crisis caused by demonetisation of Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,000 notes in AIADMK leader and Chief Minister Jayalalithaa’s first signed statement issued from the Apollo Hospitals on Sunday. Ms. Jayalalithaa had, in the statement, appealed to voters of Aravakurichi, Thanjavur and Thiruparankundram, where polling is slated for November 19, to vote for the ruling party. “It appears that she is only particular about getting votes and the difficulties of the people were none of her concern. It is to be seen whether those who have been pulling strings from behind the scenes over the last 50 days (since her hospitalisation) have issued the statement as a last weapon to win the election,” Mr. Stalin said in a statement. “Chief Ministers of other States have either welcomed the Centre’s move on demonetisation or criticised it. Some have given suggestions to the Prime Minister to bring the situation under control. But, neither Chief Minister Jayalalithaa, or the second-in-command in the State Cabinet, the Finance Minister O. Paneerselvam, had issued a statement on the issue so far,” he pointed out. Mr. Stalin claimed that while he wished that Ms. Jayalalithaa recovered quickly, as Leader of the Opposition, he would like her to explain the truth behind the statement that was issued on Sunday. Earlier, campaigning for the party candidate, P. Saravanan, for the by-election to Thiruparankundram constituency, Mr. Stalin said that the Centre too had not bothered about the pains of the common man who has been forced to stand in long queues to take his own money deposited in banks. On the jallikattu issue, Mr. Stalin recalled that the Union Minister of State, Pon Radhakrishnan had made a statement that all efforts were being taken to lift the ban on the bull-taming sport. He had promised that jallikattu would be conducted during Pongal. “But, it does not look so as the issue of jallikattu does not find a place in the agenda to be discussed during the next Monsoon Session,” he said. Mr. Stalin warned that his party would launch a huge protest if jallikattu was not conducted next year. Mr. Stalin also said that he got information that the Union Government had rejected the Tamil Nadu Assembly’s resolution seeking to rename Madras High Court as High Court of Tamil Nadu. “The resolution moved by the Chief Minister in the Assembly during the last session was unanimously passed with the support of all political parties in the House,” he said. The resolution was sent to the Union Government for its consideration. But, it had been rejected, he said.

288,2016-11-15,8.0,Demonetisation hits PM?s flagship crop insurance scheme,"Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s flagship crop insurance scheme has become the latest casualty in Maharashtra of the Centre's demonetisation move. Lakhs of farmers, who are already reeling from drought and crop failure, have reportedly missed the deadline to avail themselves of the scheme, which ended on November 9. The worst hit are the horticultural farmers. Though the deadline was extended to November 10, most of them missed the deadline to pay the premium as they were unable to withdraw cash from banks. On November 12, the State government held an urgent meeting with registered insurance companies to help farmers avail themselves of the scheme. A senior government official said, “The scheme applies to Kharif, Rabi and horticultural farmers. While the former two have mostly enrolled themselves within the October 31 deadline, horticultural farmers have missed it. Most of them had old currency notes and could not exchange them in banks owing to long queues.” The failure to include all farmers in the scheme could have far-reaching impacts. The scheme might not achieve its ambitious target of increasing crop area from the existing 23 per cent to 50 per cent of the gross cropped area in three years. Eight five lakh farmers are part of the scheme. Since 2000, the State government has been giving out crop insurance. Officials said over the past five years, an average of Rs. 900 crore has been doled out every year. The deadline of scheme was extended from August 2 owing to delay in shortlisting the insurance company. The Opposition has criticised the government for the delay and not ridding the scheme of its inherent flaws. Shankar Dhondge, former MLA and national president of the Nationalist Congress Party’s Rashtravadi Shetkari Sabha, said, “There is a basic flaw in the crop insurance: it doesn’t compensate farmers in accordance to the area destroyed. Meanwhile, there is chaos at the banks and the government has not given priority to farmers.” Mr. Dhondge alleged that there was a scam in the registration of insurance companies and the data list of the beneficiaries was being tampered with. Truck drivers beyond traders' means, porters paid a pittance The limited availability of cash following the demonetisation of Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,000 notes has crippled the transportation of goods to and from agricultural produce market committees (APMC). While truck drivers transport produce from the farm to the market, porters help the traders move the goods from the trucks. Sanjay Pansare, a fruit trader, said, “To rent a truck hailing from Kashmir one has to pay Rs. 80,000 to 1 lakh every day. The truck drivers don’t accept payment only in cash. We are not able to afford transportation costs.” Nanasaheb Patil, former chairman of Lasalgaon APMC, “How far can you stretch the credit game? It might be a bit easy in urban areas, but it has turned disastrous in rural areas. You have to pay in cash and there is absolutely no alternative.” Rajan Kshirsagar, an activist of the agricultural labour union from Parbhani, said porters at the APMCs are also affected. “They either have no work or are paid an awfully less amount of money.” According to government sources, market committees in Mumbai are the least affected. An official said, “We do not see major problem at present. Else, there would have been a price hike in vegetables and other commodities. We hope the situation will get better.” - Staff Reporter Printable version | Jan 7, 2017 1:17:28 AM | http://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/Demonetisation-hits-PM%E2%80%99s-flagship-crop-insurance-scheme/article16417010.ece © The Hindu SamBar, the new resto-bar that’s replaced Khar’s Loca Loca, has inventive cocktails and fun finger food inspired by the cuisine from south of the Vindhyas"

290,2016-11-15,8.0,Currency crisis cuts down on vegetables,"Demonetisation has had an impact on sale of vegetables in Coimbatore.
  Grocery shop owners, small-scale vendors, and retail buyers flock the two wholesale vegetable markets in the city every morning to purchase fresh vegetables. The markets, which register nearly Rs. 3 crore sales a day, saw business drop by nearly 30 per cent on Monday. “Even after the announcement on Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,000 notes, we were accepting these notes. However, yesterday we decided not to accept them anymore,” says M. Rajendran, president of the Thyagi Kumaran Market Vegetable Merchants’ Association. As many as 920 shops in the two markets sell about 1,500 tonnes of vegetables a day, mainly big onion, small onion, potato, tomato, chilli, and cabbage. While big onion, carrot, beans, and cabbage are purchased from Karnataka, small onion comes from different parts of Tamil Nadu. The demand is high during wedding season and also in June and drops during Aadi (July-August) and Puratasi (September-October) months. The wholesale traders need to pay every day for the vehicles that transport the vegetables to the market, workers at the shops, and the labourers who load and unload the vegetables. “We do not have enough Rs. 100 denomination notes and our customers are willing to pay only in Rs. 500 or Rs. 1,000 denominations. Hence, we decided not to accept these,” he says. The traders transfer money online to agents in other States from whom they purchase the vegetables. But, there are also several local farmers who bring the produce to these wholesale markets. “Will they accept cheque or online payment ? We need to pay them by cash immediately,” he says. This has resulted in a fall in arrival of vegetables and there might by a further reduction on Tuesday. However, the prices of vegetables are stable. “A substantial volume of vegetables is sold to Kerala. The traders there had announced indefinite strike. But they withdrew it. That is another reason for fall in sales on Monday,” Mr. Rajendran added. Traders at the markets point out that there are several customers who purchase on credit. These customers now offer to pay in advance, that too in the denominations of Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,000. Since vegetables cannot be stored and need to be sold in a day, the traders do sell on credit. “One of the vegetable buyers at the market has to pay me Rs. 90,000. Now, he is offering to pay Rs. 2 lakh. This also means I will not receive any payment from him for the next few weeks. I do not want to sell to him now and I am not in a hurry to get back the money too,” says one of the wholesale vegetable sellers here. With both the sellers and the buyers not willing to take more vegetables, sales has come down at the markets. But this might not affect prices, say the traders.

291,2016-11-15,8.0,Demonetisation and after,"The long, anxious, and frustrating wait by people outside banks and ATMs across the country over the last five days is an inevitable consequence of the decision to demonetise notes of Rs.500 and Rs.1,000. When 86 per cent of the value of notes in circulation turns suddenly invalid, as it did with Prime Minister Modi’s ‘surgical strike’ last week, a certain degree of disruption and pain is unavoidable. But the question is whether this chaos could have been anticipated and managed better than it has been. Replacement of the demonetised notes is a time-consuming exercise that requires planning of the highest order. The experience of the last few days shows that preparation was lacking and the transition could have been handled much better. ATMs are running out of cash quickly while banks are dispensing more of the Rs.2,000 notes than those of lower denominations. What use is a high-value note if there is not enough smaller currency to make an exchange? Of course, it was never an easy task for the Reserve Bank of India and the Centre to strike the right balance between secrecy and storing adequate quantity of notes for quick distribution. All the same, there are at least a couple of issues that could have been addressed differently. The new Rs.500 notes that hit the market on Monday could have been released immediately after the announcement last week. Putting out new Rs.500 notes along the Rs.2,000 notes would have placed much less strain on those of the Rs.100 denomination, which are anyway in short supply. Second, it appears that officials woke up a little late to the issue of recalibrating ATMs. At least a day, if not more, was lost as banks realised the ATMs would not be able to dispense the new notes. The communication with the public, who were in a state of panic, could have been better, too. Thankfully, the Centre has woken up to ease the pressure on the system by increasing withdrawal limits, allowing for petroleum outlets and hospitals to accept the old series of notes until November 24 and pushing more cash through post offices. The worst-affected are people in rural areas and villages where cash is king and the banking system’s penetration is poor. The decision to relax cash-holding limits for banking correspondents, the crucial link between banks and villages, to Rs.50,000 and allowing them to replenish multiple times a day should help in faster distribution. This ought to have been done much earlier. The cash crunch of the last few days is certain to have an adverse impact on consumption spending, especially in the rural areas, with the resultant effect on the economy in the third quarter.

293,2016-11-15,8.0,People?s sufferings has defeated purpose of demonetisation: Karunanidhi,"DMK leader M. Karunanidhi on Monday said even though Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s decision to demonetise Rs. 500 and Rs. 1000 notes was welcome, the sufferings of the people, who struggled to get hold of legal tender, appears to have defeated the purpose of the exercise. “It (the exercise) may not succeed in what it seeks to achieve. Instead it seems to have created negative impact. The BJP government should respond to the allegation that the announcement was made with a view to getting votes in Assembly elections in a few States,” he said in a statement. Citing the report ‘Long queues, dry ATMs fuel anger and frustration’ published in The Hindu, Mr. Karunanidhi said the BJP government should atone for the hardship it had caused to poor people and come out with relief measures. Recalling Prime Minister Modi’s speech in Goa that crores of poor people slept peacefully after his announcement, Mr Karunanidhi said on the contrary they had lost their sleep and were standing in queues to exchange their money. He said the Prime Minister also should respond to Delhi Chief Minister Aravind Kejriwal’s accusation that the former had alerted his friends before demonetising Rs. 500 and Rs. 1000 notes.

294,2016-11-15,8.0,Stalin hits out at CM for ?silence? on currency crunch,"M.K. Stalin
  : DMK treasurer M.K. Stalin on Monday questioned the absence of reference to measures to tide over the crisis caused by demonetisation of Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,000 notes in AIADMK leader and Chief Minister Jayalalithaa’s first signed statement issued from the Apollo Hospitals on Sunday. Ms. Jayalalithaa had, in the statement, appealed to voters of Aravakurichi, Thanjavur and Thiruparankundram, where polling is slated for November 19, to vote for the ruling party. “It appears that she is only particular about getting votes and the difficulties of the people were none of her concern. It is to be seen whether those who have been pulling strings from behind the scenes over the last 50 days (since her hospitalisation) have issued the statement as a last weapon to win the election,” Mr. Stalin said in a statement. “Chief Ministers of other States have either welcomed the Centre’s move on demonetisation or criticised it. Some have given suggestions to the Prime Minister to bring the situation under control. But, neither Chief Minister Jayalalithaa, or the second-in-command in the State Cabinet, the Finance Minister O. Paneerselvam, had issued a statement on the issue so far,” he pointed out. Mr. Stalin claimed that while he wished that Ms. Jayalalithaa recovered quickly, as Leader of the Opposition, he would like her to explain the truth behind the statement that was issued on Sunday. Earlier, campaigning for the party candidate, P. Saravanan, for the by-election to Thiruparankundram constituency, Mr. Stalin said that the Centre too had not bothered about the pains of the common man who has been forced to stand in long queues to take his own money deposited in banks. On the jallikattu issue, Mr. Stalin recalled that the Union Minister of State, Pon Radhakrishnan had made a statement that all efforts were being taken to lift the ban on the bull-taming sport. He had promised that jallikattu would be conducted during Pongal. “But, it does not look so as the issue of jallikattu does not find a place in the agenda to be discussed during the next Monsoon Session,” he said. Mr. Stalin warned that his party would launch a huge protest if jallikattu was not conducted next year. Mr. Stalin also said that he got information that the Union Government had rejected the Tamil Nadu Assembly’s resolution seeking to rename Madras High Court as High Court of Tamil Nadu. “The resolution moved by the Chief Minister in the Assembly during the last session was unanimously passed with the support of all political parties in the House,” he said. The resolution was sent to the Union Government for its consideration. But, it had been rejected, he said.

295,2016-11-15,8.0,Demonetisation: HC dismisses plea to postpone election,": Asserting that the court does not believe that the demonetisation process has any impact on the election process, the First Bench of the Madras High Court said, “If at all, it reduces the play of money.” The Bench comprising Chief Justice S.K. Kaul and Justice R. Mahadevan made the observations while dismissing a miscellaneous petition moved by A.A. Sadik Ali, President of Forum for Election Integrity, seeking to postpone the elections to the Aravakurichi and Thanjavur Assembly constituencies scheduled on November 19 to December 31 in view of demonetisation of high value currencies. Mr. Sadik Ali alleged that the candidates of the AIADMK and the DMK contesting from the two constituencies had access to robust finance, and hence, there were chances of distribution of money to voters in the denomination of Rs. 500 and 1,000 to the tune of Rs. 50 crores. “Since an individual voter can exchange currencies worth Rs. 4,000 per day, the black money which would be distributed to them can be easily accounted for,” the petitioner claimed. Alleging that the election would pave way for large-scale conversion of black money, the petitioner said that unless the election is postponed till December 31, which is the last day to exchange the demonetised currencies, the conversion of such unaccounted money cannot be stopped.

296,2016-11-15,8.0,Demonetisation to heat up winter session,"The Congress and seven other Opposition parties met on Monday — ahead of the Winter Session of Parliament beginning November 16 — to formulate a joint strategy to put the government on the mat on a range of issues including the demonetisation move that has caused great inconvenience to the people, especially the poor . After the meeting, Congress deputy leader in Rajya Sabha Anand Sharma said, “There is broad consensus that the demonetisation issue should be raised in Parliament.” However, with many leaders not available, the Opposition parties will meet again on Tuesday afternoon to finalise their plans. The Samajwadi Party and the Bahujan Samaj Party are busy campaigning for the Uttar Pradesh elections and the DMK, AIADMK, NCP and AAP were unrepresented on Monday. Janata Dal(U) leader Sharad Yadav, who was present at the meeting, told The Hindu, “We are hoping to build the sort of opposition unity that we had on the Land Acquisition Act.” The cohesion then had forced the Modi government to replace its draft Bill with one that satisfied the Opposition. On Monday, apart from Mr Yadav, others present at the meeting included the CPI(M)’s Sitaram Yechury, the TMC’s Sudip Bandopadhyay and Derek O'Brien, the CPI’s D. Raja, the RJD’s Prem Chand Gupta, the JMM’s Sushil Kumar and the YSR Congress’s M. Rajamohan Reddy. The Congress was represented by Mr. Sharma and leader in Lok Sabha Mallikarjun Kharge. The leaders also met Leader of Opposition in the Rajya Sabha Ghulam Nabi Azad in Parliament House. The focus of their discussion was on steps to unitedly confront the government on the demonetisation move that had had caused great hardship to the common man. Other subjects discussed included the stalemate between the government and the judiciary that had resulted in many vacancies not being filled as well as the grave situation that farmers across the country were facing. If the meeting saw archrivals TMC and the CPI(M) coming together on a common platform, there was some heartburn among the Opposition leaders gathered there that TMC chief and West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee had independently sought time with President Pranab Mukherjee. “We should have all gone together,” said a senior opposition leader at the meeting. Meanwhile, on Monday, Ms. Banerjee, now apparently to forget her rivalry with the Left, tweeted her opposition after Prime Minister Narendra Modi justified the demonetisation move in Ghazipur. “The PM said the poor are sleeping peacefully. This is an insult to commoners and in bad taste. My humble suggestion is not to hit the common people like this.” The Congress, also continued its daily briefing on the demonetisation issue, as the party’s communication chief Randeep Surjewala said, “India’s ‘wheel of development’ has come to a standstill as crores of people are lining up in front of banks and ATMs giving up their daily livelihood... An autocratic Prime Minister, bloated by the arrogance of numbers, has plunged the country into a state of ‘economic anarchy’, wiping out people’s earnings and creating a colossal sense of fear and insecurity.. People standing in lines outside are neither thieves nor black money hoarders. . Already 23 innocent people have lost their lives,” he said.

297,2016-11-15,8.0,Modi terms demonetisation ?kadak chai?,"PM Modi after the NDA meeting.
  Prime Minister Narendra Modi said on Monday that the poor supported his decision to demonetise Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,000 notes and questioned the moral authority of his political opponents, especially the Congress, to criticise his step as ‘anti-poor’ and ‘anti-common man’. Addressing a parivartan rally in eastern Uttar Pradesh’s Ghazipur, Mr. Modi recalled the Emergency imposed by former Prime Minister Indira Gandhi and charged that the measure was taken only to “save Ms. Gandhi’s seat.” In contrast, Mr. Modi claimed, his move was taken in the “interest of the poor and farmers,” and for the good of the country. A day after his emotional speech in Goa, the Prime Minister reiterated his appeal to the people to give him 50 days to complete the “big task,” a “mahayagna of honesty,” of unearthing black money. Mr. Modi referred to his own background as a tea-seller. “My decision is kadak (strong) When I was a child, the poor would ask me to make kadak chai. The poor are fond of it. I have a habit since childhood of making kadak chai. It suits the poor but warps the expression of the rich,” he said. As a door-to-door operation against black money would have taken years, he said he was left with only the demonetisation solution.

298,2016-11-15,8.0,?Demonetisation has reduced cash flow to cooperative societies?,"K. Raviraj Hegde, president, Dakshina Kannada Milk Producers Cooperative Union, speaking after inaugurating the 63rd All India Cooperative Week in Udupi on Monday.
  Kishan Hegde Kolkebail, president, Udupi District Cooperatives Union, said on Monday that the Union government’s move to demonetise currency notes in the denomination of Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,000 has hit the cooperative sector hard. He was speaking at the 63rd All India Cooperative Week celebrations organised by the State Federation of Cooperatives, District Cooperatives Union and Udupi Taluk Industrial Cooperative Society, here. Mr. Kolkebail said that the demonetisation had reduced the cash flow to cooperative societies. These societies could only remit cash to the commercial banks. Though customers were ready to repay their loans, accepting it had become a problem. Cooperative societies were not official agents for exchanging currency. Only banks registered with the Reserve Bank of India could exchange currency. The cooperatives sector had urged the government to give some relaxation to it, Mr. Kolkebail said. In his inaugural speech, K. Raviraj Hegde, president, Dakshina Kannada Cooperative Milk Producers Union, said that there were 225 cooperative societies in Udupi district. The working capital of these societies put together was estimated at Rs. 5,000 crore. They were producing more services to the people than the commercial banks in rural areas. About the Dakshina Kannada Cooperative Milk Producers Union, he said that nearly 4 lakh litres of milk was being collected daily from the dairy farmers in the district. The farmers were getting close to Rs. 35 per litre including incentive. Due to the collection of milk from dairy farmers and their sale in urban centres, nearly Rs. 14 crore was moving from urban areas to rural areas in the region. This showed how cooperative sector was helping the people in the rural areas. It was easier for people to get loans from the cooperative societies than commercial banks, Mr. Hegde, said. Kokkarne Surendranath Shetty, associate professor, MGM College, delivered a lecture on importance of cooperative societies. Arun Kumar Shetty, president of Udupi Taluk Industrial Cooperative Society; Meenakshi Bannanje, president, Udupi City Municipal Council; Amrita Krishnamurthy, municipal councillor; Praveen B. Nayak, Deputy Registrar of Cooperatives; and Vittal Sherigar, Deputy Director, Cooperatives Audit Department, were present.

  Hyderabad: One of the traffic bottlenecks near the High Court building is the jalebi seller. But on Monday evening, the shop wore a deserted look with few buyers parking their vehicles to pick up the stuff. “My business is down. I might have done 50 per cent of the business that I usually do. For the last few days it is like this only,” says Kishen, pointing at the sparse crowd in front of the other shops selling similar stuff. In the inner lanes near Mahbub Chowk, Sohail from Kala Patthar, who sells women’s hair clips, combs etc from a push cart has a similar story to narrate: “I have done business of Rs. 3500 today. Usually by this time, I would have done business of about Rs. 8,000 or Rs. 10,000. People are not even stopping to have a look at what I am selling,” says Sohail adding: “But people are very keen to know how much change I have and whether I am willing to exchange it for Rs. 500 notes.” The busy business streets where driving is usually a problem in the evening hours wasn’t the case on Monday evening. “There are about 4 crore hawkers in the country including urban, rural and railway hawkers. All of them are reporting 50 to 60 per cent drop in earnings threatening their livelihoods. Though some hawkers make good money, many of them lead a hand to mouth existence and they are having a tough time as people have stopped buying from them,” says Sakitman Ghosh, general secretary of National Hawkers Federation. Though the pigeons whirring inside the Mecca Masjid number the same, the number of bird feeders has declined. “Balance kam hai (people don’t have money). People are not buying the grain to feed the birds. And I don’t know whether I should get more seed or wait for a few days till people have enough money,” says Sami, the bird feed vendor. The only person who reported soaring business is photocopy shop owner Abdul Qadir. “Over the last five days, I would have photocopied about 5000 documents and I have the printed form that is required at banks where money has to be deposited. But every other business has taken a big hit,” says Mr. Qadir summing up the mood on the street.

  Buses running empty and hotels not having enough visitors even during what is considered the peak tourist season has become the norm ever since high-denomination notes were demonetised last week. The State tourism industry is reporting huge losses: while private tourist taxi operators estimate a 50 per cent drop in business, the Karnataka State Road Transport Corporation (KSRTC) and Karnataka State Hotels and Restaurants Association claim that business has dipped by 25 to 30 per cent over the last few days. Rajender Kumar Kataria, managing director, KSRTC, said direct bookings had dropped by 25 per cent. However, online ticket reservations have seen a drop of about 10 per cent. “During weekdays we get revenue of Rs. 7.25 crore, while weekends fetch us over Rs. 8 crore,” he said, and added that weekend business was down by Rs. 1 crore. During November and December, nearly 95 per cent of the KSRTC’s 8,400-odd fleet strength hits the road because of an increase in the number of tourists from and to Bengaluru. However, in the last few days, they have been operating fewer buses. “Usually during weekends over 25,000 tickets are booked from and to Bengaluru from places such as Tamil Nadu, Kerala and Andhra Pradesh. This weekend, it dropped to 20,000,” Mr. Kataria said. Meanwhile, R.K. Holla, president, Bangalore Tourist Taxi Operators’ Association, said that people were not able to withdraw money from ATMs because of which there had been a drastic drop in the number of tourists visiting hills stations and pilgrimage spots in Karnataka and the neighbouring States. Mr. Holla explained that owing to the lack of cash, even drivers were reluctant to go on long trips. “All of them do not have bank accounts because of which they have have not been able to draw money to give change. Since the process of getting inter-State permit has not gone online still, they are not able to pay cash and get them. Besides, the drivers usually have food at roadside eateries that do not accept card payment. All these factors put together has impacted our business,” he said. Checks on those making bulk bookings KSRTC managing director Rajender Kumar Kataria has instructed his staff to run checks on organisations making bulk bookings before accepting the order. Often, private and political parties book over 50 buses for functions. However, over the last 48 hours, KSRTC has received three such bulk bookings from organisations, and officials suspect that it’s a money laundering gimmick. Such bulk bookings usually cost over Rs 1 crore. “For this, customers have to provide a deposit amount running to lakhs of rupees. This can be ‘black’ money and when they cancel it in a few days, we will have to return it,” said a KSRTC official. To prevent this, the managing director has asked his staff to consult the head office before cancelling bulk bookings.

303,2016-11-15,8.0,Demonetisation takes the fizz out of property sales,"Stamp paper vendors waiting for customers outside the sub-registrar’s office in Mysuru South on Monday.
  The impact of demonetisation of Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,000 notes is being felt in the real estate sector, which recorded around 40 per cent slump in transaction in Mysuru. The worst hit is the sale and resale of plots, which entails high volume of cash, unlike the sale of built or ready-to-occupy apartments that are loan-based. A dip in transactions was seen when the demonetisation move was announced on Tuesday night, said senior sub-registrar of Mysuru South M. Vivek. He told The Hindu that the slump in the Mysuru south office was about 15 per cent but it was as high as 40 per cent in three other sub-registrar offices in the city. “Against the average 40 site registrations per day in the Mysuru South office, the figures have come down by 15 per cent and there is a dip in high-value transactions,” he added. However, there was a property registration of Rs. 8.9 crore during this period, Mr. Vivek said. Between Wednesday and Friday, the revenue earned was around Rs.1.3 crore in the Mysuru south office. However, stakeholders, including builders, aver that the slump in real estate transaction was higher. A prominent real estate agent, also into writing deeds, said transactions and registration of sites are down by 50 per cent and only properties with bank loans are being registered. “The scenario will prevail till March 2017 and real estate value will crash further to benefit commoners,” he said. The real estate market in Mysuru was already stagnating and hence, unless there is a distress sale, sellers are expected to hold on to their property to create an artificial scarcity in the long run, according to him. However, the Builders Association of India, Mysuru centre, averred that purchase of flats and apartments by the salaried class has not been affected as funding is through loan. Demonetisation will mostly impact sale of sites, BAI said. But, there is a perception that sale of high-end luxury apartments and properties will be affected.

  “Nobody had that kind of money [high denomination notes of Rs.10,000, Rs. 5,000 and Rs.1,000] when demonetisation happened in 1978. It did not affect us directly. The working class carried on without any problem. The kind of money that was taken off circulation was something that only families of industrialists had at that point. Currency notes of Rs.1,000 were a rarity in the hands of the common man. Back then, salaries and savings didn’t amount to the currency that was demonetised,” said 80-year-old Lakhbir Singh, an ex-government employee, talking about the 1978 demonetisation move. Mr. Singh said that daily life — buying daily provisions, travel, paying rent, school fee, etc. — had carried on seamlessly. “It would not be wrong to say that normal life carried on smoothly. There was no problem for the general public as a whole,” he added. He did say that this time, though the move was welcome, it had hit the common man the hardest. ‘Common man hit hard’ “I see people waiting in long lines outside banks and post offices, and these don’t seem to be getting shorter. The transition has hit the common man and his daily life has been disturbed. My son, who works in the public relations field, was asked to take advance payments in cash [old currency notes], which put him in a fix. I would say that comparing the two phases wouldn’t be fair. We hope, however, that the long-term benefits reach the common man,’’ he added. Seventy-nine-year-old Promilla Tuli, who ran a garments factory back in 1978, recalled that demonetisation then had not affected her business. “I remember hearing that the government had abolished high-value notes, but it didn’t matter to us. We never had those notes; we didn’t feel the need for it,” she said. In fact, many old-timers say that most people were not affected the last time the government experimented with demonetisation as the amount of high-value notes in circulation was quite less. The average citizen did not feel the pinch as these notes accounted for about 10 per cent of the money in circulation. This time, however, the government has withdrawn Rs.1,000 and Rs.500 notes, which account for over 85 per cent of the money, causing all sections of society being hit hard. It didn’t matter to us. We never had those notes; we didn’t feel the need for it Printable version | Jan 7, 2017 1:17:55 AM | http://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/When-demonetisation-did-not-whip-up-a-storm/article16448140.ece © The Hindu The Hindu revisits the gruesome December 2012 gang-rape to examine if Delhi is any safer for the average woman today"

307,2016-11-15,8.0,Currency crisis cuts down on vegetables,"Demonetisation has had an impact on sale of vegetables in Coimbatore. –Photo: S. Siva Saravanan.
  Grocery shop owners, small-scale vendors, and retail buyers flock the two wholesale vegetable markets in the city every morning to purchase fresh vegetables. The markets, which register nearly Rs. 3 crore sales a day, saw business drop by nearly 30 per cent on Monday. “Even after the announcement on Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,000 notes, we were accepting these notes. However, yesterday we decided not to accept them anymore,” says M. Rajendran, president of the Thyagi Kumaran Market Vegetable Merchants’ Association. As many as 920 shops in the two markets sell about 1,500 tonnes of vegetables a day, mainly big onion, small onion, potato, tomato, chilli, and cabbage. While big onion, carrot, beans, and cabbage are purchased from Karnataka, small onion comes from different parts of Tamil Nadu. The demand is high during wedding season and also in June and drops during Aadi (July-August) and Puratasi (September-October) months. The wholesale traders need to pay every day for the vehicles that transport the vegetables to the market, workers at the shops, and the labourers who load and unload the vegetables. “We do not have enough Rs. 100 denomination notes and our customers are willing to pay only in Rs. 500 or Rs. 1,000 denominations. Hence, we decided not to accept these,” he says. The traders transfer money online to agents in other States from whom they purchase the vegetables. But, there are also several local farmers who bring the produce to these wholesale markets. “Will they accept cheque or online payment ? We need to pay them by cash immediately,” he says. This has resulted in a fall in arrival of vegetables and there might by a further reduction on Tuesday. However, the prices of vegetables are stable. “A substantial volume of vegetables is sold to Kerala. The traders there had announced indefinite strike. But they withdrew it. That is another reason for fall in sales on Monday,” Mr. Rajendran added. Traders at the markets point out that there are several customers who purchase on credit. These customers now offer to pay in advance, that too in the denominations of Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,000. Since vegetables cannot be stored and need to be sold in a day, the traders do sell on credit. “One of the vegetable buyers at the market has to pay me Rs. 90,000. Now, he is offering to pay Rs. 2 lakh. This also means I will not receive any payment from him for the next few weeks. I do not want to sell to him now and I am not in a hurry to get back the money too,” says one of the wholesale vegetable sellers here. With both the sellers and the buyers not willing to take more vegetables, sales has come down at the markets. But this might not affect prices, say the traders.

308,2016-11-15,8.0,Increased availability of currency notes eases tension in city,"City bankers have attributed the reduced rush of customers at various branches on Monday to the public getting accustomed to the situation and the increased availability of currency notes of Rs.100 and less. “People are less panicky, they are now familiar with the situation,” said a banker, pointing out that only bank branches in certain pockets such as West Kochi witnessed substantial rush during the day. Bank branches in Mattancherry and Willingdon Island saw brisk currency exchange and deposit operations throughout the day. However, the rush was manageable and was expected to stabilise by Tuesday, said another bank official. The rush in these areas has been attributed to the presence of a large number of workers from other States, who are trying to send money home. Deposits Manager of a small bank in Aluva said the branch received deposits of around Rs.4 crore over the last two days. Another bank manager said even small branches received deposits to the tune of Rs.1 crore per day. The currency flow was quite stable and people were getting the money they wanted, said an official, who said that around 100 on-site ATMs in the heart of Kochi filled in the morning hours were empty by afternoon. The ATMs were replenished with cash late afternoon. “There is sufficient stock of Rs.100 notes,” said a bank official on the outskirts of Kochi. A total of Rs.8 lakh was received by the bank branch on Monday, of which around Rs.6 lakh was in Rs.100 denomination and the rest in denominations of Rs.10 and Rs.20. The situation should be better by Tuesday, said one of the bankers. However, small businesses continued to be hit. Vegetable sales Business at the vegetable wholesale market picked up momentum on Monday after a lull of around three days. However, supplies are likely to be restricted on Tuesday as lorries have not left for vegetable markets such as Ottanchatram and Coimbatore because of a strike declared by the Vyapari Vyavasayi Ekopana Samiti. The strike has since been withdrawn. A market stall owner said cool season vegetable supplies would not be restricted as Mettuppalayam supplies are already on their way.

309,2016-11-15,8.0,Demonetisation: More savings accounts opened in Head Post Office,"In the wake of demonetisation of high value currency notes, a large number of people have started approaching post offices to exchange money. Over the last couple of days, over 50 savings accounts have been opened in Thoothukudi Head Post office as it would facilitate the account holders to deposit the demonetised Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,000 currencies. Long queues People were seen waiting in queues as three counters were opened in the Head Post Office to enable the customers to open savings accounts. Apart from doing their regular works, the postal staff were engaged in exchanging the demonetised notes in two special counters. Ever day Rs. 6 lakh to Rs. 8 lakh had been exchanged here, reliable sources told The Hindu on Monday. Moreover, postal ATMs have also been functioning effectively and account holders were allowed to withdraw a maximum of Rs.2,000 a day. However, there was no adequate supply of fresh currency notes from banks to meet the growing demands of people. Besides, additional currency note counting machines and fake currency note detectors were required, sources said. Despite these shortcomings, the postal staff had been rendering their services to the public, the sources added. Most of the people, who were seen waiting in the queue at the post office, said with the new Rs.2,000 currency note it was hard for them to buy commodities in grocery shops since the shop keepers could not give the balance amount. Fresh currency notes of Rs.500 should have been released initially and circulated through banks instead of Rs.2,000. Cash in lower denominations were not adequately available in most of the banks, they pointed out.

But when he withdrew the amount and was about to resume construction, he was hit by the Centre’s sudden demonetisation move. “There was no problem in depositing the amount and withdrawing the same in future. But, we will forego day’s labour for depositing the amount in a bank, 30 kms away from my village,” said Diju. Diju is not the lone beneficiary of IAY houses sanctioned under the Sunabeda Area Development Programme (SDP). Several tribals in remote Sunabeda and Soseng gram panchayats in Sunabeda Wildlife Sanctuary would be inconvenienced. Sunabeda plateau is one of the acutely LWE-affected areas in the State. During past few months, most IAY beneficiaries from Sunabeda area had gone to banks several times to check if funds had been transferred to their account. According to reports reaching from different districts, villagers in remote and inaccessible region were clueless about coping with the situation. Meanwhile, in another development the Odisha government announced that line departments were prepared to disburse old age pension in 6,000 gram panchayats on November 15. Pensions will be paid in hand as most panchayats were devoid of banking facilities. As per the State government, Rs 140 crore will be distributed among 35 lakh beneficiaries under different social security schemes.

311,2016-11-15,8.0,Stalin hits out at CM for ?silence? on currency crunch,": DMK treasurer M.K. Stalin on Monday questioned the absence of reference to measures to tide over the crisis caused by demonetisation of Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,000 notes in AIADMK leader and Chief Minister Jayalalithaa’s first signed statement issued from the Apollo Hospitals on Sunday. Ms. Jayalalithaa had, in the statement, appealed to voters of Aravakurichi, Thanjavur and Thiruparankundram, where polling is slated for November 19, to vote for the ruling party. “It appears that she is only particular about getting votes and the difficulties of the people were none of her concern. It is to be seen whether those who have been pulling strings from behind the scenes over the last 50 days (since her hospitalisation) have issued the statement as a last weapon to win the election,” Mr. Stalin said in a statement. “Chief Ministers of other States have either welcomed the Centre’s move on demonetisation or criticised it. Some have given suggestions to the Prime Minister to bring the situation under control. But, neither Chief Minister Jayalalithaa, or the second-in-command in the State Cabinet, the Finance Minister O. Paneerselvam, had issued a statement on the issue so far,” he pointed out. Mr. Stalin claimed that while he wished that Ms. Jayalalithaa recovered quickly, as Leader of the Opposition, he would like her to explain the truth behind the statement that was issued on Sunday. Earlier, campaigning for the party candidate, P. Saravanan, for the by-election to Thiruparankundram constituency, Mr. Stalin said that the Centre too had not bothered about the pains of the common man who has been forced to stand in long queues to take his own money deposited in banks. Jallikattu ban On the jallikattu issue, Mr. Stalin recalled that the Union Minister of State, Pon Radhakrishnan had made a statement that all efforts were being taken to lift the ban on the bull-taming sport. He had promised that jallikattu would be conducted during Pongal. “But, it does not look so as the issue of jallikattu does not find a place in the agenda to be discussed during the next Monsoon Session,” he said. Mr. Stalin warned that his party would launch a huge protest if jallikattu was not conducted next year. Mr. Stalin also said that he got information that the Union Government had rejected the Tamil Nadu Assembly’s resolution seeking to rename Madras High Court as High Court of Tamil Nadu.

312,2016-11-15,8.0,Demonetisation: Madras High Court dismisses plea to postpone election,": Asserting that the court does not believe that the demonetisation process has any impact on the election process, the First Bench of the Madras High Court said, “If at all, it reduces the play of money.” The Bench comprising Chief Justice S.K. Kaul and Justice R. Mahadevan made the observations while dismissing a miscellaneous petition moved by A.A. Sadik Ali, President of Forum for Election Integrity, seeking to postpone the elections to the Aravakurichi and Thanjavur Assembly constituencies scheduled on November 19 to December 31 in view of demonetisation of high value currencies. Mr. Sadik Ali alleged that the candidates of the AIADMK and the DMK contesting from the two constituencies had access to robust finance, and hence, there were chances of distribution of money to voters in the denomination of Rs. 500 and 1,000 to the tune of Rs. 50 crores. “Since an individual voter can exchange currencies worth Rs. 4,000 per day, the black money which would be distributed to them can be easily accounted for,” the petitioner claimed. Alleging that the election would pave way for large-scale conversion of black money, the petitioner said that unless the election is postponed till December 31, which is the last day to exchange the demonetised currencies, the conversion of such unaccounted money cannot be stopped.

313,2016-11-15,8.0,Touts profiting from currency crackdown,"I just exchanged Rs.10,000 for Rs. 9,300 says Yuvaraj, of Poovathi near Rayakottai. He didn’t have a choice. “I was already a week late in paying wages to the farm workers,” says the farmer, growing tomatoes. “Also, I didn’t have cash to buy pesticides.” Following the demonetisation, a local currency exchange touts have emerged. These locals-turned-touts charge exorbitant commission for exchange of notes from the villagers. Welcome to the villages, serviced poorly by unstaffed banks. It is Rs.100 commission to exchange the demonetised Rs.500 note. “He can afford to forego Rs.700, but that is three-day wages for us,” says Munuthayi. But, people spend a whole day in the bank and return with Rs.1,000. Can we afford to do that,” asks Rukamma. These women may discuss all they want,while deweeding the field of purple Marigolds. But, none of them has a single rupee in the potlis, only some left over betel nuts. Bent in the midst deweeding is Lakshmi, the farm owner. She is worried about how the women will get paid. The payment date was Wednesday, the day after demonetisation was announced. Awaiting their wages, the women share the betel nuts to keep away hunger. The cash-based village economy - and its inter-dependent labour between the farm labourer and the marginal farm owners, with the latter supplementing with family labour - is evidently derailed. Yes, it’s a commission of Rs.100 to exchange Rs.500. When there is no money for food, Rs.400 is good enough for some, said a man, unwilling to be named. On Friday, Perumal went to the bank at 9 a.m. to deposit Rs.10,000. He returned to his cucumber field at 4 p.m. The nationalised bank at Nagamangalam had given him only Rs.4,000 and he had four workers to pay. Incidentally, when this correspondent, visited the headquarters branch of the same bank in Krishnagiri on Thursday, a customer who had deposited Rs.10,000 had withdrawn the entire amount.” The branch manager had told The Hindu that the withdrawal limit for deposit was Rs.10,000. The rural branches are channelled with less cash. The rural populace neither have multi-bank accounts, nor hold ATM cards. The ATMs in these areas were never loaded with money like the rest of the country on Friday.

  Thousands of Congress workers took to streets across Telangana on Monday protesting what it termed ‘unplanned move’ of demonetising high value currency by Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Responding to the call given by Telangana Pradesh Congress Committee president N.Uttam Kumar Reddy, party cadres held demonstrations throughout the State taking out rallies and burning the Prime Minister in effigy. Mr. Uttam Kumar Reddy himself led the protest in Hyderabad by first offering floral tributes to former Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru and then taking out a march in Abids. He and other Congress leaders were taken into custody by the police and shifted to Gandhinagar police station. Congress leaders continued their protest inside the police station and raised “Modi Hatao — Desh Bacho” (Remove Modi To Save The Country). Speaking to reporters, the TPCC chief accused the Prime Minister of enforcing ‘Financial Emergency’ in the country by implementing an unplanned decision. He said that the demonetisation of high-value notes has brought misery to common people. “Congress is not against removal of black money. But the way they are implementing it,” he said.

  Rajkumar Chatterjee, a tourist from Kolkata, reached Visakhapatnam on November 9, for a week’s stay in the port city. Little did he know that a decision taken by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on the night of November 8, would jeopardise his week-long fun that he planned with his family. The demonetisation scheme has hit the tourists hard. Talking to The Hindu , he said, “I was carrying all Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,000 notes. And they turned into waste paper, as neither the hotels nor the taxi drivers or the restaurants for that matter, refused to take the currency, as they were no longer legal tender.” With great difficulty, he could get in touch with a common friend who helped him out with some change and exchange a few notes of Rs. 500. “My tour, which was planned for a lavish outing, has turned into rationed living,” he lamented. This has been the case with most of the tourists, who feel that they are stranded despite the government giving a clear instruction that tourists are exempted. The tourists are facing problem for minor things such as paying auto charges or buying gift articles from roadside stalls, as every tourist does, or for paying food bills at small eateries. “We have not encountered any problems in big malls, as there are card swiping machines. But not everybody can afford to do shopping at malls. And most importantly, this city is new to us and we are unable to exchange our notes at the ATM counters, as they are either not working or there is a big queue,” said Arup Sen, another tourist from Burdwan district in West Bengal. According to Sunit Kumar Panja of Nimantran Hotel, the tourist flow has suddenly died down. “Being a hotelier, we are in touch with most of the lodges and we understand that there are over 30 per cent cancellations. This is the beginning of the tourist season and if the trend continues then the business for this season is hit badly,” he said. Besides tourism, the flow from the city has also slowed down. According to the Welfare Group of Tours and Travels, there are about 10 per cent cancellation of outbound travel and those who are planning have indefinitely postponed their travel plans. “People do not want to take the risk, till things settle down,” said an executive of the tour company. Last year, the city of destiny recorded about 1.15 crores of tourist footfalls, which included about 69,000 foreign tourists. The tourism season is at its peak from October to January, which stood at about 40 lakhs of the 1.15 crores, which accounts for about 35 per cent in four months.

  One of the traffic bottlenecks near the High Court building is the jalebi seller. But on Monday evening, the shop wore a deserted look with few buyers parking their vehicles to pick up the stuff. “My business is down. I might have done 50 per cent of the business that I usually do. For the last few days it is like this only,” says Kishen, pointing to the sparse crowd in front of the other shops selling similar stuff. In the inner lanes near Mahbub Chowk, Sohail from Kala Patthar, who sells women’s hair clips and combs, among others from a pushcart has a similar story to narrate: “I have done business of Rs. 3,500 today. Usually by this time, I would have done business of about Rs. 8,000 or Rs. 10,000. People are not even stopping to have a look at what I am selling.” “But people are very keen to know how much change I have and whether I am willing to exchange it for Rs. 500 notes,” he adds. The busy business streets where driving is usually a problem in the evening hours wasn’t the case on Monday evening. “There are about 4 crore hawkers in the country including urban, rural and railway hawkers. All of them are reporting 50 to 60 per cent drop in earnings threatening their livelihoods. Though some hawkers make good money, many of them lead a hand-to-mouth existence and they are having a tough time as people have stopped buying from them,” says Sakitman Ghosh, general secretary of National Hawkers Federation. Though the pigeons whirring inside the Mecca Masjid number the same, the number of bird feeders has declined. “Balance kam hai (people don’t have money). People are not buying the grain to feed the birds. And I don’t know whether I should get more seed or wait for a few days till people have enough money,” says Sami, the bird feed vendor. The only person who reported soaring business is photocopy shop owner Abdul Qadir. “Over the last five days, I would have photocopied about 5000 documents and I have the printed form that is required at banks where money has to be deposited. But every other business has taken a big hit,” says Mr. Qadir summing up the mood on the street.

317,2016-11-15,8.0,?Demonetisation has reduced cash flow to cooperative societies?,"K. Raviraj Hegde, president, Dakshina Kannada Milk Producers Cooperative Union, speaking after inaugurating the 63rdAll India Cooperative Week in Udupi on Monday.
  Kishan Hegde Kolkebail, president, Udupi District Cooperatives Union, said on Monday that the Union government’s move to demonetise currency notes in the denomination of Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,000 has hit the cooperative sector hard. He was speaking at the 63rd All India Cooperative Week celebrations organised by the State Federation of Cooperatives, District Cooperatives Union and Udupi Taluk Industrial Cooperative Society, here. Mr. Kolkebail said that the demonetisation had reduced the cash flow to cooperative societies. These societies could only remit cash to the commercial banks. Though customers were ready to repay their loans, accepting it had become a problem. Cooperative societies were not official agents for exchanging currency. Only banks registered with the Reserve Bank of India could exchange currency. The cooperatives sector had urged the government to give some relaxation to it, Mr. Kolkebail said. In his inaugural speech, K. Raviraj Hegde, president, Dakshina Kannada Cooperative Milk Producers Union, said that there were 225 cooperative societies in Udupi district. The working capital of these societies put together was estimated at Rs. 5,000 crore. They were producing more services to the people than the commercial banks in rural areas. About the Dakshina Kannada Cooperative Milk Producers Union, he said that nearly 4 lakh litres of milk was being collected daily from the dairy farmers in the district. The farmers were getting close to Rs. 35 per litre including incentive. Due to the collection of milk from dairy farmers and their sale in urban centres, nearly Rs. 14 crore was moving from urban areas to rural areas in the region. This showed how cooperative sector was helping the people in the rural areas. It was easier for people to get loans from the cooperative societies than commercial banks, Mr. Hegde, said. Kokkarne Surendranath Shetty, associate professor, MGM College, delivered a lecture on importance of cooperative societies. Arun Kumar Shetty, president of Udupi Taluk Industrial Cooperative Society; Meenakshi Bannanje, president, Udupi City Municipal Council; Amrita Krishnamurthy, municipal councillor; Praveen B. Nayak, Deputy Registrar of Cooperatives; and Vittal Sherigar, Deputy Director, Cooperatives Audit Department, were present.

318,2016-11-16,9.0,Demonetisation dominates Chhattisgarh Assembly,"The Narendra Modi government’s decision to scrap Rs. 500 and Rs. 1000 currency notes dominated the Chhattisgarh Legislative Assembly for the second consecutive day on Wednesday. The House had witnessed uproar several times on Tuesday over the issue and saw five adjournments. The Chhattisgarh Chief Minister, Raman Singh, had submitted a proposal to “congratulate” the central government “on the historic decision” before the House, however, the main opposition party, the Congress, demanded that it be allowed to take part in the discussion. The BJP MLAs backed the demonetisation move, whereas the Congress leaders called it an “attempt by the central government to hide its inability to bring back black money stashed abroad.” “People all over the country are panicked due to this move. A farmer from Raigarh district went to bank thrice but he could not get money which he desperately needed for his children. In the end, he killed himself. We are against black money but why is the government troubling common people who have nothing to do with the black money? The way you have taken up this process has only troubled the common man. Take back this decision and bring it only when you are completely prepared,” Chhattisgarh Congress president, Bhupesh Baghel, said. Many BJP leaders also conceded that common people were facing temporary inconvenience due to demonetisation. The House also witnessed heated verbal exchanges between the opposition and the treasury benches. “Marriages are being canceled for the scarcity of cash. The chief minister has the finance portfolio here, why did he not think of inconvenience to the people by this move? The situation is getting worse in rural areas of the State,” senior Congress MLA, Satyanarayn Sharma, said. Accepting that inconvenience would be caused for a few days, BJP MLA Shrichan Sundarani, claimed that the people of the country have made up their mind to “strengthen the economy.” Parliamentary affair minister, Ajay Chandrakar, furiously defended the demonetisation and recounted the measures taken by the government to avoid hardship to the common public. However, the opposition was not satisfied and the leader of opposition T.S. Singh Deo refused to support the government in “this gamble.” CM Raman Singh equated the demonetisation decision to Indira Gandhi’s support to the formation of Bangladesh. He claimed that “96 per cent” of the country were sleeping peacefully and only “four percent” with black money were sleepless because of the “bold and daring decision of the PM.” “If our jawans can stand on the border for days to protect us why can’t we stand in line for four hours to strengthen our economy? This decision has destroyed the terror and Maoist funding,” he said, adding that his government has taken all necessary precautions to help the people of the State. However, Mr. Singh’s speech was repeatedly disrupted by Congress MLAs who demanded the division of vote on the “proposal of congratulation” to the Central government. The vote division went in favour of the government by 16 votes.

However, they believe that demonetisation and the push for digital payments will boost the sector in the long run, especially since CoD orders being returned is one of their biggest “pain-points.” As per industry estimates, the cost for CoD returns is about Rs.20 in urban areas and about Rs.75 for non-urban locations. Snapdeal co-founder Kunal Bahl said CoD orders on its platform had come down to 30 per cent of the overall sales. “After the announcement, COD orders have declined to 30 per cent of our sales from 50 per cent,” he said at an event by Digital India Foundation. Mr.Bahl said that higher adoption of digital payments would help improve unit economics for e-commerce companies in the long run. “From an economics perspective, it is positive for e-commerce firms, as CoD returns are a big pain point from an economic and logistics perspective. That will also get significantly mitigated going forward as more payments move to digital,” he pointed out. The surge in digital paymentswill come down once cash comes into the system, but the “equilibrium will settle at higher level than when we entered the demonetisation phase,” he said. Shopclues co-founder and CEO Sanjay Sethi said in the first four days the company saw a decline of about 15 per cent. “Overall, we saw a decline of about 7 per cent for our orders,” he said. Flipkart co-founder Sachin Bansal, who attended the event via video call, said, “There was a drop in sales when the announcement was made. There were cancellations of CoD orders but it’s recovering now.” Following the demonetisation, some companies like Amazon had temporarily halted CoD facility, while others like Flipkart and Snapdeal had put a cap on the value of orders that could be delivered through the service.

321,2016-11-16,9.0,Congress activists protest against demonetisation,"Congress workers staging a demonstration in front of the Income Tax Office in Tirupati on Wednesday.
  The Congress activists organised a novel protest against demonetisation at the local Bhavani Nagar Circle, by rallying around with pushcarts and distributing goods for free among the public. The demonstration, led by DCC president Venugopal Reddy here on Wednesday, sought to highlight the inconvenience caused to the general public, particularly the vendors, small traders and other members of the working class, who are unable to exchange high denomination notes for buying regular livelihood items and continuing their normal trade. “Their [small traders/vendors] business have been dull since the announcement, with not many customers purchasing the products owing to the high value notes and lack of subsequent currency for exchange. How can the government justify their act if the working class, who depend on their daily business, are the worst affected?” he questioned. Terming the current demonetisation as a ‘move which was not well thought out’ [by the Central government], the activists alleged Prime Minster Narendra Modi has been supporting industrialists like Ambanis, Adani etc., at the cost of the common man. They later unveiled a flex banner highlighting the same message pictorially with a tagline - ‘Nalla Kuberulaki Pattam Kattina PM’. Meanwhile, members of the All India Trade Union Congress (AITUC) staged a protest at the premises of the State Bank of Hyderabad (SBH) near the Municipal Office Circle. Highlighting the issues faced by daily wage workers, AITUC general secretary Murali said the workers had not received wages for the past few days and expressed their inability to buy essential commodities. They further demanded that the government increase the availability of ₹ 100 notes, round-the-clock ATMs and extension of the date for depositing money in bank till December 31.

322,2016-11-16,9.0,Legal questions on demonetisation find no answer in SC,"The legal provision under which the Reserve Bank of India’s (RBI) demonetisation notification of November 8 was issued only empowers the Central Government to scrap “series” of bank notes and not the “entire existing currency” of Rs. 500 and Rs. 1000 notes. Section 26 (2) of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) Act of 1934 — the provision under which the notification was issued — allows the Centre to make a declaration only to the extent that “any series of bank notes of any denomination ceases to be legal tender.” The argument was pressed before a Bench of Chief Justice of India T.S. Thakur and Justice D.Y. Chandrachud on Wednesday, and remains to be addressed by the apex court. “We are on the constitutional validity of the November 8 notification. Under what diktat have all series of Rs. 500 and Rs. 1000 notes become black money? Does this mean any note of Rs. 500 is black money?” senior advocate Kapil Sibal, appearing for petitioner Adil Alvi, had submitted. Secondly, the Supreme Court was informed of how the government has insisted on identity cards for people coming to exchange the demonetised Rs. 500 and Rs. 1000 notes for the new currency. Section 26 (2) of the 1934 Act poses no such requirements. Even the latest development to use indelible ink mark to avoid repeat exchanges is a restriction not found in the legal provision. The court was also asked to adjudicate on the authority of the notification to restrict a citizen’s right to withdraw money from his own bank account. “Payment by the bank is a guaranteed act under the law. Banks are only trustees of a person’s money. I can withdraw any amount of money. Under what law can you restrict my right to withdrawal?” Mr. Sibal had asked. Another legal question placed before the court was on what basis the notification categorised Rs. 500 currency as “high denomination” in this time of inflation when the particular denomination of bank notes forms 86 per cent of value of currency. “We have to see at some point of time what they took into account for reaching this conclusion,” Mr. Sibal submitted. Section 26A of the 1934 Act records the first demonetisation which took place in 1956 when the government of that time scrapped all Rs. 500, Rs. 1000 and Rs. 10,000 bank notes minted before January 13, 1946. In 1978, demonetisation happened again, but the bank notes frozen then formed only two per cent of the currency value in circulation.

323,2016-11-16,9.0,Labour-intensive industries feel pinch of demonetisation,"Labour-intensive industries in Thoothukudi district have been affected by the recent demonetisation of higher value currency notes, as they are not able to pay wages to their workers. The traditional safety match industry, though largely mechanised, relied on labourers, J. Devadoss, secretary, South India Match Manufacturers’ Association, Kovilpatti told The Hindu on Wednesday. Around one lakh workers had been relying on this industry. Wages would normally be paid once a week based on productivity. The cash withdrawal allowed after demonetisation was inadequate to pay wages to labourers.’ The cash withdrawal limit had been limited to Rs.24,000 for a week for savings account holders and Rs.50,000 for current account holders. The ceiling should be increased to facilitate payment of salaries to employees. Presently the labourers had been managing their day-to-day expenses with the Deepavali bonus and last month salary, Mr. Devadoss said. Moreover, traders from North India were reluctant to place orders for match boxes as they were used to cash transactions only. Movement of finished goods to Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Madhya Pradesh and Odisha had come to a halt in the last one week, he said. Salt industry had also been facing a setback as stocks of manufactured salt could not be transported. According to A.R.A.S. Dhanabalan, secretary, Thoothukudi Small Scale Salt Manufacturers’ Association, salt production was stopped with the onset of monsoon in October-end. Normally, there would a demand for salt during rainy season, but not this year, he said. Despite achieving high production this year, the product could not be marketed because of demonetisation. M.S.P. Thenraj, president, Thoothukudi Salt Traders’ Association, said there was a slowdown in the trade as employers could not pay wages to labourers engaged in packing and loading. Since lorry drivers and attendants could not be paid, only 20 per cent to 30 per cent trucks were being operated, that too on short distance routes, S. Varadharajan, secretary, Tuticorin District Container Truck Owners’ Association, said. Though truck operators had been exempted from paying toll until November 18 and demonetised notes were valid till November 24, the lorry crew needed money to buy food. The Rs. 2,000 notes could not be given to them as they would find it difficult to get change. Had the authorities released new Rs.500 notes earlier, this crisis could have been better managed, he said. Many ice plant owners were also feeling the pinch as suspension of mechanised boat fishing operations after the demonetisation exercise had forced them to stop production.

324,2016-11-16,9.0,"Demonetisation: Opposition alleges information leak, seeks JPC probe","BSP chief Mayawati speaks during the debate on demonetisation in the Rajya Sabha on Wednesday.     The winter session of Rajya Sabha opened on Wednesday with a united opposition mounting an assault on the government over demonetisation, saying it had led to “economic anarchy” in the country and alleged selective leak of the information before the announcement which should be probed by a Joint Parliamentary Committee. The government rejected as baseless the Opposition charge that there was “leakage” of the November 8, 2016 decision and said everyone was taken by surprise which is why there are “initial” problems. Joining ranks over the raging issue, parties such as the Congress, the JD(U), the RJD, the SP, the BSP, the Trinamool Congress, the Left parties and the AIADMK slammed the government, particularly targeting Prime Minister Narendra Modi, for making Rs. 500 and Rs. 1000 notes invalid and said the “ill-timed” and “ill-conceived” step had severely hit the common people, the farmers and the poor. During a discussion on demonetisation, which was taken up after suspension of all business in response to notices given by a host of Opposition members, a scathing attack was made on the government which strongly defended the step as one taken in national interest and to end corruption and black money, which it linked to terror activities in the country. Alleging that the information had been leaked to BJP units and “friends of BJP”, a number of Opposition parties demanded a Joint Parliamentary Committee probe into it. During the course of seven-hour debate which remained inconclusive, there were repeated demands by the Opposition members that the Prime Minister should be present in the House to listen to the members. The Leader of the Opposition in the Rajya Sabha Ghulam Nabi Azad said Mr. Modi, who did not come to the House on Wednesday, should at least be present on Thursday and possibly intervene. Initiating the debate, Congress leader Anand Sharma used wit and humour to attack Modi, saying he was “insensitive” to problems caused to the common man. The “ill-timed” and “ill-conceived” move has unleashed “economic anarchy” in the country and benefited a few, he said. “Your government is insensitive,” he said, adding Mr. Modi was riding a bullet train in Japan when the old, women and common man were queueing up at banks at 3 a.m. to get currency to buy their daily needs. Questioning the government’s contention that the step was taken to end the menace of black money, the former Union Minister said a Rs. 2000 note has been brought which is similar to the paper on which churan is sold and “sheds colour”. Mr. Sharma alleged that the information on demonetisation was selectively leaked. “Your BJP units have deposited crores of rupees (just before the November 8 decision),” he said. He quoted some media reports to support his allegation, saying State Bank of India — the country’s largest lender — knew of the decision way back in March and a Gujarati newspaper had in April 2016 published a report of move to withdraw Rs. 500 and Rs. 1000 notes. He asked the Prime Minister to state where he got Rs.23,000-24,000 crore, estimated by the International Money Watch Group, for his Lok Sabha elections. He also asked if cheque or credit card payments were made to organise his rally in Ghazipur in Uttar Pradesh a few days ago. He demanded a probe into “how many people bought more than Rs 1 crore of foreign currency and bullion” since April. “This is a serious issue... you never kept secrecy (about the decision),” Mr. Sharma said. Mr. Sharma said Mr. Modi had in his Goa speech had stated that those standing in line at banks were those involved in 2G spectrum and coal scam as well as holding black money. “I condemn the Prime Minister for calling the poor standing in queue for his Rs 4,000-4,500, black money holders and scamsters,” he said. Referring to Mr. Modi’s statement in Goa last week that certain forces were out to eliminate him, the Congress leader asked him to name the conspirators wanting to eliminate the Prime Minister of India. The Congress will not tolerate anyone planning to harm the Prime Minister of the country, he said. Taking a dig at Mr. Modi, he said someone who “changes clothes five times a day”, has become Prime Minister and travels around the globe was “calling himself a sanyasi and tapasvi”. Mr. Sharma demanded that the names of persons holding accounts in Swiss banks and those revealed in the Leichtenstein and HSBC lists should be made public. The names of bank loan defaulters above Rs. 5000 crore should also be made public. While the decision had put the common man to immense hardship by way of having to stand in long queues to lay hands on valid currency to meet daily needs, the information about demonetisation was selectively leaked to the “friends of BJP,” Mr. Sharma alleged. The move had branded 86 per cent of the currency in circulation black money and “everyone a criminal,” he said adding when Mr. Modi announced the plan it was expected that adequate arrangements would be made for dispensing new notes. So banks and ATMs were shut on November 9, 2016, but the expectation of normalcy from next day were dashed with queues only getting longer by the day. The government policy was to “benefit those who are your friends and hurt those who question you,” he said adding an atmosphere has been created in the country where questions cannot be asked and those doing so branded anti-nationals. “The magnanimous Prime Minister allowed Rs. 4,000 of old currency to be changed... what right does the Constitution give the government to place restrictions on withdrawal of ones hard-earned money,” he asked, adding one has to “beg to be allowed to withdraw his own money”. He said former RBI Governor I.G. Patel had written about the government’s decision to demonetise currency in 1978 and it would be absurd to think that all ill-gotten money is kept in cash and not invested in real estate, bullion, equities or foreign exchange. Mr. Modi, Mr. Sharma said, had reasoned that withdrawal of the higher denomination currency to fight against black money, terrorist funding and counterfeit currency. the Congress is unequivocally opposed to black money and opposes any force that print counterfeit currency. Mr. Sharma said the government in one stroke took away 86.4 per cent of the over Rs. 16 lakh crore currency in circulation. . “Did the government think that 86 per cent of the currency in circulation was counterfeit or black money,” he asked. Stating that cash to GDP ratio of Indian economy was 12-14 per cent, he said farmers, daily wagers and workers do not carry credit cards, cheque books or card swipe machines in their “dhotis or tahmeds”. Moving towards cashless economy was fine but even the most developed economies of U.S. or Europe have not achieved that objective yet. If they had, the U.S. central bank would have stopped printing dollars, European Central Bank won’t be printing Euros and the U.K. central bank would have stopped printing pound sterling, he said. Stating that the government had in one stroke declared everyone a criminal, he said the government and the Finance Minister have stated that terrorists would have benefited if advance information on the decision was given. “Which terrorist goes to RBI with sack full of counterfeit currency to change.” After withdrawing Rs. 500 and Rs. 1000 notes, restrictions were placed even on foreign tourists who could not get their currency changed. The Congress leader said Finance Minister Arun Jaitley had informed Parliament in August 2016 that fake currency was 0.02 per cent of the total currency in circulation. “If 0.02 per cent by government admission is counterfeit currency, how can that be made the base to remove 86 per cent of currency in circulation,” he said. An undeclared emergency has put common people in grave inconvenience, he said while crime money, ill-gotten wealth and that accrued through corruption or tax evasion is black money, Prime Minister should answer if he considered money in the market, or in households, or with farmers, workers and employees was also black money. “This question arises because a message has gone that Indian economy was run on black money... you decide but don’t brand the whole country,” he said, adding whether the cash the farmers gets for his crop or the one he uses to buy seeds or fertilizer was black money. He said the move had rendered millions of agriculture workers and labourers unemployed. Across the country, ATM machines are not working even after more than a week of the demonetisation decision and queues at banks are only increasing, Mr. Sharma said, adding the BJP government has not lived up to its poll promise of creating 5 crore jobs as employment is on the rise. BSP leader Mayawati said the House should request the Prime Minister to be present and answer the members’ concerns. It is “a very serious issue”, she said, adding she has been observing Mr. Jaitley appears “sad”. Her demand was supported by Mr. Azad, who said the Prime Minister must be present in the House to hear out the concerns of various parties. Earlier, Deputy Chairman P.J. Kurien said he had received as many as 13 notices under rule 267 for suspension of business to take up discussion on inconvinience and hardships caused by demonetisation of currency. He said there was a general consensus for discussion and the government too was agreeable, so the list of business as notified stands completely suspended. Mr. Azad demanded that Mr. Modi should at least “hear out the feelings of six-seven main parties, otherwise there is a mismatch. The feelings of Opposition members should be heard by PM. I demand that at least he hears them out and sit in the House at least today. We can wait for him to come.” This was objected to by D.P. Tripathi (NCP), who said that as the Leader of the Opposition he should not distinguish between the big and small parties. Ram Gopal Yadav joined Mr. Sharma to allege that information on demonetisation was “leaked” and termed it as a scam while demanding a thorough probe into it. “A BJP leader in Punjab had tweeted on November 5 about the new Rs. 2000 note. How did this happen? This is an issue of concern. There is a scam in this. This should definitely be probed,” he said, alleging further that 10 per cent of the people have 90 per cent of wealth of the country and the remaining 90 per cent do not have anything. The common people, especially the poor and the housewives were put to great hardship through this move and if elections are held today they will teach this government a lesson, he said, adding that majority of women who saved money through household savings were upset with the move. “Elections are not fought with money power. You cannot win elections through money power. No one can win elections like that. Elections are won only by winning the hearts of people,” he said. Demonetisation of high denomination currency has created big problems to common people and and law and order situation is being created with police being deployed outside banks to control the queue. “Do not hold elections now. If you meet and ask for votes from housewives in villages, they will beat you up with belan and you will have to embalm your back with turmeric,” he said, adding that you might lose elections if you hold early polls. Mr. Yadav said the entire House was against corrupt and drug money, but lamented that an impression is being created that those opposing this are against curbing black money which is erroneous. Mr. Yadav also sought a probe into the “suspicion” of leak of the demonetisation decision and said a JPC can be constituted. He said the move by the government has led to lot of hardships in the villages and the villagers have stopped buying normal things like toothpaste and hair oil. “If this continues, no one would buy Baba Ramdev products also and his factories will shut down,” he said, suggesting that the government should restart the scheme for people to declare their black money. He said that the government has fixed the Basic Selling Price was Rs. 1,500 per quintal but because of the demonetisation, the price has come down to just Rs. 1,000 and demanded that farmers should be allowed to use the old notes to buy seeds and fertilisers. Taking note of Prime Minister’s remarks that he might be killed because of his move, Mr. Yadav said there should be probe to find out who these people are and precaution should be taken. He said it should also be probed if the statement was made only for political motive. He also mentioned that off late, many messages are being spread on social media targeting the PM in “filthiest of words” and the cyber cell should find out where it is originating from. AIADMK leader A. Navaneethakrishnan said the RBI and the government have failed the rural people with this move which has threatened the saving habit of people. JD(U) leader Sharad Yadav, who also sought a JPC probe into the suspected leak, said the sudden move was akin to “jumping out of a moving train”. He said unlike the rich, who the PM said were standing in queue, it was the poor, handicapped and old people who were doing so to get their hands on their hard earned money. He alleged that while loans worth Rs. 7,000 crore was written off on Wednesday by banks including Rs. 1,200 crore of Vijay Mallya, the Prime Minister had made the honest of the country to stand in queues. Mr. Yadav also took a dig at Mr. Jaitley saying he was sure that the Finance Minister was not part of the decision making on demonetisation, because had he been, Mr. Jaitley would have tipped him off. This remark left most members including Mr. Jaitley laughing. CPI(M) leader Sitaram Yechury said that of the 130 crore population in the country, only 2.6 crore have credit cards. He took a dig at Mr. Modi and narrated the infamous quote of Queen Marie Antoinette during the French revolution who had said that people can eat cakes when they don’t have bread. “We have Modi Antoinette who says ‘If you don’t have paper, use plastic’”. Launching a frontal attack on the Prime Minister, Mr. Yechury compared him with a Roman ruler. He said a Senator had remarked about this ruler that: “I think he knows what Rome is. Rome is the mob. Conjure magic for them and they’ll be distracted. Take away their freedom and still they’ll roar. The beating heart of Rome is not the marble of the Senate, it’s the sand of the Coliseum. He’ll bring them death — and they will love him for it.” Alleging that a BJP unit in Kolkata deposited Rs. 1 crore in Indian’s Bank Account on November 8, 2016 he said “prove me if I am wrong.” He added that Prime Minister was advertising for Paytm while talking about cashless economy. “It is no longer Jai Hind. PM is appearing for advertisements Jio Hind.” He questioned how the cashless transactions could take place when 86 per cent of the transactions in the country took place via cash. The CPI(M) leader said 1/5th of the economy is black economy and people who kept black money invested it in real estate, gold etc. That is why the imports surged and stated that it was this PM only who had stated that 95 per cent of the black money is stashed offshore and is in safe havens. “PM is cleaning a pond to kill crocodiles but big crocodiles have survived and only small fish are dying.” He alleged that SBI has waived off Rs. 7,000 crore of NPAs, to which Mr. Jaitely said that written off does not means loan waiver. Mr. Yechury while mentioning Mr. Mallya said in effect the money given to the defaulter was not going to be realised. Mr. Yechury said by demonetising Rs. 500 and Rs. 1000 notes, the problem of black money was not going to be solved and this way the government was killing the poor. He also demanded that corporate funding of all political parties should stop and there should be a system of state funding for elections to which Mr. Kurien said, “Why don’t you move a private member’s bill in this regard?” On Mr. Yechury’s charge that the government had brought it FCRA for foreign funding, Mr. Jaitley said there is only a small amendment to benefit Indian companies giving funds in Indian accounts. Mr. Yechury also questioned how cooperative banks were not entrusted with powers to change currency notes whereas bulks of the Indians were dealing with rural cooperative banks. Terming the demonetisation move as Tughlak shahi, he said the length of queues before banks and ATMs was ever increasing and asked why the government was agonising the people. He sought an investigation into the move, saying “let there be a joint parliamentary committee” for a proper probe. . “We need to know the motive behind the move” as before every parliamentary session there is some gimmick which diverts attention from other major issues. Power Minister Piyush Goyal, who spoke on behalf of the ruling side, rejected as baseless the opposition charge that there was “leakage” of the decision and said everyone was taken by surprise which is why there are “initial” problems. “There is no politics in it. It is a step taken in national interest,” he said, adding it will help the country in the long run. “If anyone has the strength to take on black money and corruption, it is the BJP government and Narendra Modi,” the minister said. He claimed that common people are out in support of the government’s move which is aimed against graft and terror and that the step will lead to curbing inflation and tax rate may come down. Mr. Goyal claimed that the country has welcomed this initiative of the Modi government and it is natural that some people who have black money and are indulging in corruption and black money are worried about it. “There is no curb on honestly-earned money. So nobody should have a problem,” he added. “Desh me imandaar ka samman hua hai aur beimaan ka nuksaan hua hai (The honest have been honoured and the dishonest have faced losses),” he said. “I am confident that public is understanding the initial problems because the decision was kept a secret. No honest taxpayer will lose a single rupee. The loss will be of those who have amassed wealth through corruption and black money and the public should also support the government in the move,” he said. Mr. Goyal said some pain and difficulty in the implementation of such a decision is inevitable but despite that the people have strongly supported the move. He urged all the parties to support the move so that the House gives a message to the country that all are against corruption and black money. To Mr. Sharma’s charge that those questioning the government are labelled as anti-national, he said, “Understandably if someone opposes it (demonetisation), questions will be raised on whether they are against ending the menace of corruption and black money in the country.” Taking a dig at the opposition, he said, “We thought all political parties will support us in Parliament. But for some reasons they have opposed the move. It seems they are worried due to the large public favouring it and supporting the government despite the problems being faced by them.” Mr. Goyal also said the BJP has already put out its poll expenses on the website and after this step all will think before indulging in corruption and black marketing. Responding to issues raised by the Opposition, he said some people have been saying that seven or 10 days’ time should have been given. “Secrecy is most important for such a step,” he added. Listing the benefits of the move, Mr. Goyal said interest rates will come down, inflation would be curbed and even the tax rate will come down. “If 5 people don’t pay tax, the brunt is borne by the rest of 95 percent people. And if taxes are paid, there will be more money with the Centre to carry out welfare works for farmers, women, SC and ST sections,” he added. With regard to allegations that the move has been timed to benefit the BJP in the U.P. elections, he said such a statement itself implies that people support this step. To demands that the government should declare the names of people who have Swiss Bank accounts, Mr. Goyal said such a step will make it difficult for government to obtain more information about such accounts. But some people want the government to make the error of declaring these names and then it will have difficulty in getting this information, he claimed. Launching a scathing attack on the government, Ms. Mayawati compared demonetisation with an “economic emergency” thrust on the nation. The move, she said, would rebound against the BJP in the 2019 general elections and the party would face defeat in the assembly elections in five states including Uttar Pradesh, Punjab and Assam. “Masses are in pain. The Prime Minister must be sleeping after taking pills. The move is without preparedness and people will punish BJP in 2019 during general elections. “People of five States going for elections including Uttar Pradesh and Punjab will punish BJP,” she said, adding that the poor and the middle classes were the worst sufferers. “It is an immature decision taken in haste and the whole country feels that is an ‘economic emergency’,” she said adding that it was like a “Bharatbandi situation.” “Many died not from shock but from problems. We are not opposed to flushing out black money from the system but the decision to ban notes has been taken in haste without proper preparation,” she said, adding that private hospitals were closing their doors to patients while the farmers have no money to buy seeds. She said ATMs did not function during the initial two days when the Prime Minister made big claims in Japan and alleged that the BJP had resorted to corruption and people were brought to Mr. Modi’s recent rally in Ghazipur by paying money. “Ten months time for preparing the move was devoted to settling notes with some BJP leaders and industrialists,” the BSP chief said and sought to know why Prime Minister has sought 50 days time when he took 10 months for his secret preparations for the move. At the same time, she said if the PM really wanted to curb black money, he should take action against his party leader from Karnataka who was also part of a mining mafia. She also questioned the timing of the move saying all of a sudden why this move was implemented when elections were due in five States. Pramod Tiwari (Congress) compared the Prime Minister to mythological demon Bhasmasur, who had the power to burn and turn into ashes anyone whose head he touched with his hand. “This move by government will impact rabi crops, wheat and potatoes, and have left farmers in distress,” he added. Mr. Tiwari said Mr. Modi had compared the currency notes of Rs. 500 and Rs. 1000 to scrap, which is wrong as the promissory note mentions that the government ‘promises’ to pay the owner that much amount. To this, Minister of State for Parliamentary Affairs Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi said Mr. Modi had only said that these denomination notes will be scrap for the corrupt people. Mr. Tiwari compared Modi to Muammar Qadhafi, Benito Mussolini and Adolf Hitler, which drew sharp criticism from the BJP benches with Mr. Naqvi and Ravi Shankar Prasad asking the Chair to expunge the remarks. But Mr. Tiwari stood his ground. Mr. Tiwari claimed that the government has taken this step to help its industrialist friends. He demanded that a JPC should be formed to probe the issue. Information and Broadcasting Minister Venkaiah Naidu said the exercise to take out Rs 500 and Rs 1000 currency notes is . “temporary pain for long-term gain“. “Prime Minister wants a behavioural change in the country... This is a war on corruption and black money and you (Opposition) have to decide which side you are on,” he added. Listing the efforts made by the NDA government to weed out corruption and black money, the Union Urban Development Minister said that in its first cabinet meeting the government has cleared the proposal to set up a special investigative team on black money. “We fought the elections in 2014 on corruption and scams. People expected us to take a clear cut stand,” he said. Attacking the Opposition, the Minister said he expected an enlightened debate in the House. Stating that government is following all the developments in the issue, he informed that the Prime Minister is holding review meeting everyday and the Finance Minister is closely monitoring the situation. Mr. Naidu said that according to information on the Internet, the parallel economy in India is 22.2 per cent of country’s total economy, while it is 8 per cent for the U.S. After Mr. Naidu’s speech, Deputy Chairman P.J. Kurien said that the discussion is not over and will continue on Thursday from 2 p.m. To this, some members said the debate is very important and it should start from 11 a.m. by suspending Zero Hour and the Question Hour. Mr. Azad said the discussion is under Rule 267, which means all business has to suspended. Mr. Kurien replied that the rule was applicable for Wednesday and if it has to be put for Thursday’s discussion, then a motion has to be moved tomorrow at the appropriate time. Mr. Azad also demanded that the Prime Minister should also be present in the House during the discussion. Mr. Kurien adjourned the House for the day saying discussion will be done at 2 p.m. unless members move a motion.

325,2016-11-16,9.0,Legal questions on demonetisation find no answer in SC,"The legal provision under which the Reserve Bank of India’s (RBI) demonetisation notification of November 8 was issued only empowers the Central Government to scrap “series” of bank notes and not the “entire existing currency” of Rs. 500 and Rs. 1000 notes. Section 26 (2) of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) Act of 1934 — the provision under which the notification was issued — allows the Centre to make a declaration only to the extent that “any series of bank notes of any denomination ceases to be legal tender.” The argument was pressed before a Bench of Chief Justice of India T.S. Thakur and Justice D.Y. Chandrachud on Wednesday, and remains to be addressed by the apex court. “We are on the constitutional validity of the November 8 notification. Under what diktat have all series of Rs. 500 and Rs. 1000 notes become black money? Does this mean any note of Rs. 500 is black money?” senior advocate Kapil Sibal, appearing for petitioner Adil Alvi, had submitted. Secondly, the Supreme Court was informed of how the government has insisted on identity cards for people coming to exchange the demonetised Rs. 500 and Rs. 1000 notes for the new currency. Section 26 (2) of the 1934 Act poses no such requirements. Even the latest development to use indelible ink mark to avoid repeat exchanges is a restriction not found in the legal provision. The court was also asked to adjudicate on the authority of the notification to restrict a citizen’s right to withdraw money from his own bank account. “Payment by the bank is a guaranteed act under the law. Banks are only trustees of a person’s money. I can withdraw any amount of money. Under what law can you restrict my right to withdrawal?” Mr. Sibal had asked. Another legal question placed before the court was on what basis the notification categorised Rs. 500 currency as “high denomination” in this time of inflation when the particular denomination of bank notes forms 86 per cent of value of currency. “We have to see at some point of time what they took into account for reaching this conclusion,” Mr. Sibal submitted. Section 26A of the 1934 Act records the first demonetisation which took place in 1956 when the government of that time scrapped all Rs. 500, Rs. 1000 and Rs. 10,000 bank notes minted before January 13, 1946. In 1978, demonetisation happened again, but the bank notes frozen then formed only two per cent of the currency value in circulation.

326,2016-11-16,9.0,"Demonetisation: Opposition alleges information leak, seeks JPC probe","Congress leader Anand Sharma speaks during the debate on demonetisation in the Rajya Sabha on Wednesday.
  The winter session of Rajya Sabha opened on Wednesday with a united opposition mounting an assault on the government over demonetisation, saying it had led to “economic anarchy” in the country and alleged selective leak of the information before the announcement which should be probed by a Joint Parliamentary Committee. The government rejected as baseless the Opposition charge that there was “leakage” of the November 8, 2016 decision and said everyone was taken by surprise which is why there are “initial” problems. Joining ranks over the raging issue, parties such as the Congress, the JD(U), the RJD, the SP, the BSP, the Trinamool Congress, the Left parties and the AIADMK slammed the government, particularly targeting Prime Minister Narendra Modi, for making Rs. 500 and Rs. 1000 notes invalid and said the “ill-timed” and “ill-conceived” step had severely hit the common people, the farmers and the poor. During a discussion on demonetisation, which was taken up after suspension of all business in response to notices given by a host of Opposition members, a scathing attack was made on the government which strongly defended the step as one taken in national interest and to end corruption and black money, which it linked to terror activities in the country. Alleging that the information had been leaked to BJP units and “friends of BJP”, a number of Opposition parties demanded a Joint Parliamentary Committee probe into it. During the course of seven-hour debate which remained inconclusive, there were repeated demands by the Opposition members that the Prime Minister should be present in the House to listen to the members. The Leader of the Opposition in the Rajya Sabha Ghulam Nabi Azad said Mr. Modi, who did not come to the House on Wednesday, should at least be present on Thursday and possibly intervene. Initiating the debate, Congress leader Anand Sharma used wit and humour to attack Modi, saying he was “insensitive” to problems caused to the common man. The “ill-timed” and “ill-conceived” move has unleashed “economic anarchy” in the country and benefited a few, he said. “Your government is insensitive,” he said, adding Mr. Modi was riding a bullet train in Japan when the old, women and common man were queueing up at banks at 3 a.m. to get currency to buy their daily needs. Questioning the government’s contention that the step was taken to end the menace of black money, the former Union Minister said a Rs. 2000 note has been brought which is similar to the paper on which churan is sold and “sheds colour”. Mr. Sharma alleged that the information on demonetisation was selectively leaked. “Your BJP units have deposited crores of rupees (just before the November 8 decision),” he said. He quoted some media reports to support his allegation, saying State Bank of India — the country’s largest lender — knew of the decision way back in March and a Gujarati newspaper had in April 2016 published a report of move to withdraw Rs. 500 and Rs. 1000 notes. He asked the Prime Minister to state where he got Rs.23,000-24,000 crore, estimated by the International Money Watch Group, for his Lok Sabha elections. He also asked if cheque or credit card payments were made to organise his rally in Ghazipur in Uttar Pradesh a few days ago. You never kept secrecy: Anand Sharma

 He demanded a probe into “how many people bought more than Rs 1 crore of foreign currency and bullion” since April. “This is a serious issue... you never kept secrecy (about the decision),” Mr. Sharma said. Mr. Sharma said Mr. Modi had in his Goa speech had stated that those standing in line at banks were those involved in 2G spectrum and coal scam as well as holding black money. “I condemn the Prime Minister for calling the poor standing in queue for his Rs 4,000-4,500, black money holders and scamsters,” he said. Referring to Mr. Modi’s statement in Goa last week that certain forces were out to eliminate him, the Congress leader asked him to name the conspirators wanting to eliminate the Prime Minister of India. The Congress will not tolerate anyone planning to harm the Prime Minister of the country, he said. Taking a dig at Mr. Modi, he said someone who “changes clothes five times a day”, has become Prime Minister and travels around the globe was “calling himself a sanyasi and tapasvi”. Mr. Sharma demanded that the names of persons holding accounts in Swiss banks and those revealed in the Leichtenstein and HSBC lists should be made public. The names of bank loan defaulters above Rs. 5000 crore should also be made public. While the decision had put the common man to immense hardship by way of having to stand in long queues to lay hands on valid currency to meet daily needs, the information about demonetisation was selectively leaked to the “friends of BJP,” Mr. Sharma alleged. The move had branded 86 per cent of the currency in circulation black money and “everyone a criminal,” he said adding when Mr. Modi announced the plan it was expected that adequate arrangements would be made for dispensing new notes. So banks and ATMs were shut on November 9, 2016, but the expectation of normalcy from next day were dashed with queues only getting longer by the day. The government policy was to “benefit those who are your friends and hurt those who question you,” he said adding an atmosphere has been created in the country where questions cannot be asked and those doing so branded anti-nationals. “The magnanimous Prime Minister allowed Rs. 4,000 of old currency to be changed... what right does the Constitution give the government to place restrictions on withdrawal of ones hard-earned money,” he asked, adding one has to “beg to be allowed to withdraw his own money”. He said former RBI Governor I.G. Patel had written about the government’s decision to demonetise currency in 1978 and it would be absurd to think that all ill-gotten money is kept in cash and not invested in real estate, bullion, equities or foreign exchange. Mr. Modi, Mr. Sharma said, had reasoned that withdrawal of the higher denomination currency to fight against black money, terrorist funding and counterfeit currency. the Congress is unequivocally opposed to black money and opposes any force that print counterfeit currency. Mr. Sharma said the government in one stroke took away 86.4 per cent of the over Rs. 16 lakh crore currency in circulation. . “Did the government think that 86 per cent of the currency in circulation was counterfeit or black money,” he asked. Stating that cash to GDP ratio of Indian economy was 12-14 per cent, he said farmers, daily wagers and workers do not carry credit cards, cheque books or card swipe machines in their “
dhotis or tahmeds”. Moving towards cashless economy was fine but even the most developed economies of U.S. or Europe have not achieved that objective yet. If they had, the U.S. central bank would have stopped printing dollars, European Central Bank won’t be printing Euros and the U.K. central bank would have stopped printing pound sterling, he said. Stating that the government had in one stroke declared everyone a criminal, he said the government and the Finance Minister have stated that terrorists would have benefited if advance information on the decision was given. “Which terrorist goes to RBI with sack full of counterfeit currency to change.” After withdrawing Rs. 500 and Rs. 1000 notes, restrictions were placed even on foreign tourists who could not get their currency changed. The Congress leader said Finance Minister Arun Jaitley had informed Parliament in August 2016 that fake currency was 0.02 per cent of the total currency in circulation. “If 0.02 per cent by government admission is counterfeit currency, how can that be made the base to remove 86 per cent of currency in circulation,” he said. ‘An undeclared emergency’

 An undeclared emergency has put common people in grave inconvenience, he said while crime money, ill-gotten wealth and that accrued through corruption or tax evasion is black money, Prime Minister should answer if he considered money in the market, or in households, or with farmers, workers and employees was also black money. “This question arises because a message has gone that Indian economy was run on black money... you decide but don’t brand the whole country,” he said, adding whether the cash the farmers gets for his crop or the one he uses to buy seeds or fertilizer was black money. He said the move had rendered millions of agriculture workers and labourers unemployed. Across the country, ATM machines are not working even after more than a week of the demonetisation decision and queues at banks are only increasing, Mr. Sharma said, adding the BJP government has not lived up to its poll promise of creating 5 crore jobs as employment is on the rise. ‘PM should be present’

 BSP leader Mayawati said the House should request the Prime Minister to be present and answer the members’ concerns. It is “a very serious issue”, she said, adding she has been observing Mr. Jaitley appears “sad”. Her demand was supported by Mr. Azad, who said the Prime Minister must be present in the House to hear out the concerns of various parties. Earlier, Deputy Chairman P.J. Kurien said he had received as many as 13 notices under rule 267 for suspension of business to take up discussion on inconvinience and hardships caused by demonetisation of currency. He said there was a general consensus for discussion and the government too was agreeable, so the list of business as notified stands completely suspended. Mr. Azad demanded that Mr. Modi should at least “hear out the feelings of six-seven main parties, otherwise there is a mismatch. The feelings of Opposition members should be heard by PM. I demand that at least he hears them out and sit in the House at least today. We can wait for him to come.” This was objected to by D.P. Tripathi (NCP), who said that as the Leader of the Opposition he should not distinguish between the big and small parties. Ram Gopal Yadav joined Mr. Sharma to allege that information on demonetisation was “leaked” and termed it as a scam while demanding a thorough probe into it. “A BJP leader in Punjab had tweeted on November 5 about the new Rs. 2000 note. How did this happen? This is an issue of concern. There is a scam in this. This should definitely be probed,” he said, alleging further that 10 per cent of the people have 90 per cent of wealth of the country and the remaining 90 per cent do not have anything. The common people, especially the poor and the housewives were put to great hardship through this move and if elections are held today they will teach this government a lesson, he said, adding that majority of women who saved money through household savings were upset with the move. “Elections are not fought with money power. You cannot win elections through money power. No one can win elections like that. Elections are won only by winning the hearts of people,” he said. Demonetisation of high denomination currency has created big problems to common people and and law and order situation is being created with police being deployed outside banks to control the queue. “Do not hold elections now. If you meet and ask for votes from housewives in villages, they will beat you up with belan and you will have to embalm your back with turmeric,” he said, adding that you might lose elections if you hold early polls. Mr. Yadav said the entire House was against corrupt and drug money, but lamented that an impression is being created that those opposing this are against curbing black money which is erroneous. Mr. Yadav also sought a probe into the “suspicion” of leak of the demonetisation decision and said a JPC can be constituted. He said the move by the government has led to lot of hardships in the villages and the villagers have stopped buying normal things like toothpaste and hair oil. “If this continues, no one would buy Baba Ramdev products also and his factories will shut down,” he said, suggesting that the government should restart the scheme for people to declare their black money. He said that the government has fixed the Basic Selling Price was Rs. 1,500 per quintal but because of the demonetisation, the price has come down to just Rs. 1,000 and demanded that farmers should be allowed to use the old notes to buy seeds and fertilisers. Taking note of Prime Minister’s remarks that he might be killed because of his move, Mr. Yadav said there should be probe to find out who these people are and precaution should be taken. He said it should also be probed if the statement was made only for political motive. He also mentioned that off late, many messages are being spread on social media targeting the PM in “filthiest of words” and the cyber cell should find out where it is originating from. AIADMK leader A. Navaneethakrishnan said the RBI and the government have failed the rural people with this move which has threatened the saving habit of people. Move akin to jumping out of a moving train: Sharad Yadav

 JD(U) leader Sharad Yadav, who also sought a JPC probe into the suspected leak, said the sudden move was akin to “jumping out of a moving train”. He said unlike the rich, who the PM said were standing in queue, it was the poor, handicapped and old people who were doing so to get their hands on their hard earned money. He alleged that while loans worth Rs. 7,000 crore was written off on Wednesday by banks including Rs. 1,200 crore of Vijay Mallya, the Prime Minister had made the honest of the country to stand in queues. Mr. Yadav also took a dig at Mr. Jaitley saying he was sure that the Finance Minister was not part of the decision making on demonetisation, because had he been, Mr. Jaitley would have tipped him off. This remark left most members including Mr. Jaitley laughing. ‘Modi Antoinette says if you don’t have paper, use plastic’

 CPI(M) leader Sitaram Yechury said that of the 130 crore population in the country, only 2.6 crore have credit cards. He took a dig at Mr. Modi and narrated the infamous quote of Queen Marie Antoinette during the French revolution who had said that people can eat cakes when they don’t have bread. “We have Modi Antoinette who says ‘If you don’t have paper, use plastic’”. Launching a frontal attack on the Prime Minister, Mr. Yechury compared him with a Roman ruler. He said a Senator had remarked about this ruler that: “I think he knows what Rome is. Rome is the mob. Conjure magic for them and they’ll be distracted. Take away their freedom and still they’ll roar. The beating heart of Rome is not the marble of the Senate, it’s the sand of the Coliseum. He’ll bring them death — and they will love him for it.” Alleging that a BJP unit in Kolkata deposited Rs. 1 crore in Indian’s Bank Account on November 8, 2016 he said “prove me if I am wrong.” He added that Prime Minister was advertising for Paytm while talking about cashless economy. “It is no longer Jai Hind. PM is appearing for advertisements Jio Hind.” He questioned how the cashless transactions could take place when 86 per cent of the transactions in the country took place via cash. The CPI(M) leader said 1/5th of the economy is black economy and people who kept black money invested it in real estate, gold etc. That is why the imports surged and stated that it was this PM only who had stated that 95 per cent of the black money is stashed offshore and is in safe havens. “PM is cleaning a pond to kill crocodiles but big crocodiles have survived and only small fish are dying.” He alleged that SBI has waived off Rs. 7,000 crore of NPAs, to which Mr. Jaitely said that written off does not means loan waiver. Mr. Yechury while mentioning Mr. Mallya said in effect the money given to the defaulter was not going to be realised. Mr. Yechury said by demonetising Rs. 500 and Rs. 1000 notes, the problem of black money was not going to be solved and this way the government was killing the poor. He also demanded that corporate funding of all political parties should stop and there should be a system of state funding for elections to which Mr. Kurien said, “Why don’t you move a private member’s bill in this regard?” On Mr. Yechury’s charge that the government had brought it FCRA for foreign funding, Mr. Jaitley said there is only a small amendment to benefit Indian companies giving funds in Indian accounts. Mr. Yechury also questioned how cooperative banks were not entrusted with powers to change currency notes whereas bulks of the Indians were dealing with rural cooperative banks. Terming the demonetisation move as Tughlak shahi, he said the length of queues before banks and ATMs was ever increasing and asked why the government was agonising the people. He sought an investigation into the move, saying “let there be a joint parliamentary committee” for a proper probe. . “We need to know the motive behind the move” as before every parliamentary session there is some gimmick which diverts attention from other major issues. Govt. fields Piyush Goyal

 Power Minister Piyush Goyal, who spoke on behalf of the ruling side, rejected as baseless the opposition charge that there was “leakage” of the decision and said everyone was taken by surprise which is why there are “initial” problems. “There is no politics in it. It is a step taken in national interest,” he said, adding it will help the country in the long run. “If anyone has the strength to take on black money and corruption, it is the BJP government and Narendra Modi,” the minister said. He claimed that common people are out in support of the government’s move which is aimed against graft and terror and that the step will lead to curbing inflation and tax rate may come down. Mr. Goyal claimed that the country has welcomed this initiative of the Modi government and it is natural that some people who have black money and are indulging in corruption and black money are worried about it. “There is no curb on honestly-earned money. So nobody should have a problem,” he added. “
Desh me imandaar ka samman hua hai aur beimaan ka nuksaan hua hai (The honest have been honoured and the dishonest have faced losses),” he said. “I am confident that public is understanding the initial problems because the decision was kept a secret. No honest taxpayer will lose a single rupee. The loss will be of those who have amassed wealth through corruption and black money and the public should also support the government in the move,” he said. Mr. Goyal said some pain and difficulty in the implementation of such a decision is inevitable but despite that the people have strongly supported the move. He urged all the parties to support the move so that the House gives a message to the country that all are against corruption and black money. To Mr. Sharma’s charge that those questioning the government are labelled as anti-national, he said, “Understandably if someone opposes it (demonetisation), questions will be raised on whether they are against ending the menace of corruption and black money in the country.” Taking a dig at the opposition, he said, “We thought all political parties will support us in Parliament. But for some reasons they have opposed the move. It seems they are worried due to the large public favouring it and supporting the government despite the problems being faced by them.” Mr. Goyal also said the BJP has already put out its poll expenses on the website and after this step all will think before indulging in corruption and black marketing. Responding to issues raised by the Opposition, he said some people have been saying that seven or 10 days’ time should have been given. “Secrecy is most important for such a step,” he added. Listing the benefits of the move, Mr. Goyal said interest rates will come down, inflation would be curbed and even the tax rate will come down. “If 5 people don’t pay tax, the brunt is borne by the rest of 95 percent people. And if taxes are paid, there will be more money with the Centre to carry out welfare works for farmers, women, SC and ST sections,” he added. With regard to allegations that the move has been timed to benefit the BJP in the U.P. elections, he said such a statement itself implies that people support this step. To demands that the government should declare the names of people who have Swiss Bank accounts, Mr. Goyal said such a step will make it difficult for government to obtain more information about such accounts. But some people want the government to make the error of declaring these names and then it will have difficulty in getting this information, he claimed. Move will hit BJP in U.P., says Mayawati

 Launching a scathing attack on the government, Ms. Mayawati compared demonetisation with an “economic emergency” thrust on the nation. The move, she said, would rebound against the BJP in the 2019 general elections and the party would face defeat in the assembly elections in five states including Uttar Pradesh, Punjab and Assam. “Masses are in pain. The Prime Minister must be sleeping after taking pills. The move is without preparedness and people will punish BJP in 2019 during general elections. “People of five States going for elections including Uttar Pradesh and Punjab will punish BJP,” she said, adding that the poor and the middle classes were the worst sufferers. “It is an immature decision taken in haste and the whole country feels that is an ‘economic emergency’,” she said adding that it was like a “Bharatbandi situation.” “Many died not from shock but from problems. We are not opposed to flushing out black money from the system but the decision to ban notes has been taken in haste without proper preparation,” she said, adding that private hospitals were closing their doors to patients while the farmers have no money to buy seeds. She said ATMs did not function during the initial two days when the Prime Minister made big claims in Japan and alleged that the BJP had resorted to corruption and people were brought to Mr. Modi’s recent rally in Ghazipur by paying money. “Ten months time for preparing the move was devoted to settling notes with some BJP leaders and industrialists,” the BSP chief said and sought to know why Prime Minister has sought 50 days time when he took 10 months for his secret preparations for the move. At the same time, she said if the PM really wanted to curb black money, he should take action against his party leader from Karnataka who was also part of a mining mafia. She also questioned the timing of the move saying all of a sudden why this move was implemented when elections were due in five States. Pramod Tiwari likens Modi to Bhasmasur, Mussolini, Hitler, Qadhafi Pramod Tiwari (Congress) compared the Prime Minister to the mythological demon Bhasmasur, who had the power to burn and turn into ashes anyone whose head he touched with his hand. “This move by government will impact rabi crops, wheat and potatoes, and have left farmers in distress,” he added. Mr. Tiwari said Mr. Modi had compared the currency notes of Rs. 500 and Rs. 1000 to scrap, which is wrong as the promissory note mentions that the government ‘promises’ to pay the owner that much amount. To this, Minister of State for Parliamentary Affairs Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi said Mr. Modi had only said that these denomination notes will be scrap for the corrupt people. Mr. Tiwari compared Modi to Muammar Qadhafi, Benito Mussolini and Adolf Hitler, which drew sharp criticism from the BJP benches with Mr. Naqvi and Ravi Shankar Prasad asking the Chair to expunge the remarks. But Mr. Tiwari stood his ground. Mr. Tiwari claimed that the government has taken this step to help its industrialist friends. He demanded that a JPC should be formed to probe the issue. Temporary pain for long-term gain: Venkaiah Information and Broadcasting Minister Venkaiah Naidu said the exercise to take out Rs 500 and Rs 1000 currency notes is . “temporary pain for long-term gain“. “Prime Minister wants a behavioural change in the country... This is a war on corruption and black money and you (Opposition) have to decide which side you are on,” he added. Listing the efforts made by the NDA government to weed out corruption and black money, the Union Urban Development Minister said that in its first cabinet meeting the government has cleared the proposal to set up a special investigative team on black money. “We fought the elections in 2014 on corruption and scams.

Stating that government is following all the developments in the issue, he informed that the Prime Minister is holding review meeting everyday and the Finance Minister is closely monitoring the situation. Mr. Naidu said that according to information on the internet, the parallel economy in India is 22.2 per cent of country’s total economy, while it is 8 per cent for the U.S. After Mr. Naidu’s speech, Deputy Chairman P.J. Kurien said that the discussion is not over and will continue on Thursday from 2 p.m. To this, some members said the debate is very important and it should start from 11 a.m. by suspending Zero Hour and the Question Hour. Mr. Azad said the discussion is under Rule 267, which means all business has to suspended. Mr. Kurien replied that the rule was applicable for Wednesday and if it has to be put for Thursday’s discussion, then a motion has to be moved tomorrow at the appropriate time. Mr. Azad also demanded that the Prime Minister should also be present in the House during the discussion. Mr. Kurien adjourned the House for the day saying discussion will be done at 2 p.m. unless members move a motion.

327,2016-11-16,9.0,CPI (M) cadres stage demo against demonetisation,"Dindigul: Communist Party of India (Marxist) cadres staged a demonstration here on Wednesday in protest against demonetisation of Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,000 currency notes. On the pretext of abolishing black money, the Union Government, headed by Narendra Modi, banned circulation of the high-value notes, putting the people of the country to untold hardships. The life of ordinary people and salaried class had come to a grinding halt, they said. People were unable to withdraw their own money from banks. Bank officials claimed that there was no money in the chest. The protesters asked how could the Bharatiya Janata Party leaders term the hardships faced by the weaker sections of society “a sacrifice for nation building”. Speaking at the demonstration, former MLA Balabharathi, district secretary Pandi and others said if the BJP-led government was really interested in abolishing black money and bringing the guilty to book, what was the necessity to discontinue the currency notes. Income Tax officials should be entrusted with the task of conducting raids on those having huge amounts of unaccounted money. Instead of doing this, the Modi government had discontinued the currencies, jeopardising the life of the common man, she said, and urged the people to think of the evil designs of the Centre. She also came down heavily on the district police for not granting permission for the party functionaries to stage the demonstration and harassing them during the protest. The party cadres would come to the streets in protest against such actions of the police, she said.

328,2016-11-16,9.0,"Demonetisation, an indirect boost to temperance drive","Demonetisation seems to be working in the State where efforts at temperance have failed. Sale of liquor at the State-owned outlets of Bevco and Consumerfed has drastically come down in the week since Prime Minister Narendra Modi declared that Rs.500 and Rs.1,000 denomination currency notes were no longer legal tender. “The daily loss is Rs.4 crore to Rs.5 crore,” says H. Venkatesh, managing director of Kerala State Beverages (Manufacturing and Marketing) Corporation Ltd (Bevco). Sales of liquor from November 9 to 14 last year amounted to Rs.153.02 crore. The sum is Rs.140.45 crore in the corresponding period this year. Taking into account the recent increase in prices of most liquor brands, the drop in sales is high. “The currency crisis has led to plummeting of sales, and we are anticipating further losses if the demonetisation drive continues. The revenue is expected to go down further as the Sabarimala season began on Wednesday,” Mr. Venkatesh says. Bevco has 270 outlets and Consumerfed, 36, including beer and wine shops. These apart, Bevco runs 20 premium outlets. Sales of Indian-made foreign liquor and beer have been buoying up the State exchequer, with earnings of Rs.11,577 crore during 2015-16. The National Sample Survey Office figures say the per-capita consumption of liquor in the State is 196 ml a week, or 10.2 litres a year. The currency crisis, however, has led to windfall gains for bar-attached hotels that accept credit and debit cards. “I have shifted to bars, though they serve only beer and wine,” says a habitual patron of hard liquor. “Now we have asked the government to amend the Kerala Abkari Act so that Bevco outlets, at least the premium shops, can accept cards,” Mr. Venkatesh says. Eyacherry Kunhikrishnan, secretary, Kerala Madhya Nirodhana Samithi, an organisation working for prohibition, says that sales have fallen as drinkers do not have cash with them. “That is why we are saying that availability of liquor should be stopped,” he adds.

329,2016-11-16,9.0,Currency misery continues,"“I did not know that old Rs.500 notes are no more valid until this morning”, said Gowirbai (70), who works in a poultry farm at Shantigrama near Hassan on Wednesday. Her employer had paid her weekly wages in the old currency, leaving her in difficulty. When she went to a shop to purchase biscuits for her grandchildren, she was told the currency was no more valid. When this reporter visited the village on Wednesday morning, the old woman was moving from one shop to another asking for a change. Finally, she ran to her employer and got the exchange. “I get Rs.150 per day and the employer pays the wages once in a week. There is a programme in my daughter’s place. When I came to the bus-stand I was told nobody would accept the 500-rupee note. I requested many shops here, none obliged”, she said. The woman said she has no bank account and does not understand the process of exchanging currency notes. Like her, many people in rural areas have been facing difficulty. The farmers, who got cash after selling their crop, are forced to deposit money in the banks and draw later. All these years, they used to keep the cash at home and clear the loan or spend the same whenever required. “I had only Rs.3,000 in old currency. I deposited the amount in my account and so far I have not been able to withdraw as there is no cash in the bank”, said Dyave Gowda, a farmer/agriculture labourer at Boovanahalli near Hassan. He owns three acres of land and this time, he hardly got three quintals of maize. Savings Hundreds of people are lining up in front of banks and ATMs, leaving their work, to either exchange or withdraw cash, across the district. Hanume Gowda, in his early 70s, was in a queue in front of State Bank of Mysore in Shantigrama to deposit Rs.30,000 in his account. “My wife had saved Rs.30,000 over a few years. She had not told me about this. After she learnt that the old currency has been withdrawn she gave it to me to deposit. Now I am standing in the queue to link my Aadhar number to the bank account. Later, I can deposit the cash”, Hanume Gowda said. Nanjamma, his wife, who was around, also joined the conversation, “I don’t have any amount left with me for daily expenses.

330,2016-11-16,9.0,"Demonetisation is in national interest, govt defends in Rajya Sabha","Union Power Minister Piyush Goyal. File photo: Ramesh Sharma
  Facing opposition onslaught, the government on Wednesday put up a strong defence in Rajya Sabha on demonetisation, saying the step was taken in national interest to end corruption and black money, which it is said is also used for terror activities in the country. Power Minister Piyush Goyal, who spoke on behalf of the ruling side after Congress leader Anand Sharma slammed the government, rejected as baseless the Opposition charge that there was “leakage” of the decision and said everyone was taken by surprise which is why there are “initial” problems. “There is no politics in it. It is a step taken in national interest,” he said, adding the step will help the country in the long run. “If anyone has the strength to take on black money and corruption, it is the BJP government and Narendra Modi,” the Minister said. He claimed that common people are out in support of the government’s move which is aimed against graft and terror and that the step will lead to curbing inflation and tax rate may come down. Mr. Goyal claimed that the country has welcomed this initiative of the Modi government and it is natural that some people who have black money and are indulging in corruption and black money are worried about it. “Desh me imandaar ka samman hua hai aur be—imaan ka nuksaan hua hai, (The honest have been honoured and the dishonest have faced losses),” he said. “I am confident that public is understanding the initial problems because the decision was kept a secret. No honest tax-payer will lose a single rupee. The loss will be of those who have amassed wealth through corruption and black money and the public should also support the government in the move,” he said. Mr. Goyal said some pain and difficulty in the implementation of such a decision is inevitable but despite that the people have strongly supported the move. He urged all the parties to support the move so that the House gives a message to the country that all are against corruption and black money. To Mr. Sharma’s charge that those questioning the government are labelled as anti-national, he said, “Understandably if someone opposes it (demonetisation), questions will be raised on whether they are against ending the menace of corruption and black money in the country.” Taking a dig at the Opposition, he said, “We thought all political parties will support us in Parliament. But for some reasons they have opposed the move. It seems they are worried due to the large public favouring it and supporting the government despite the problems being faced by them.” Mr. Goyal also said the BJP has already put out its poll expenses on the website and after this step all will think before indulging in corruption and black marketing. Mr. Goyal said when the NDA government assumed charge in 2014, the country was embroiled in corruption and scams. Now the Modi government has taken a step, through which he has met the “expectations” of the people, the Minister added. “There are some people who are unhappy over it. This is an important step in the war against graft, terror and drugs and political parties should be happy over it,” he said. Justifying the move, Mr. Goyal also claimed that from the documents and reports available, the RBI had realised that a large quantum of money was not circulating or coming to the chests and analysed that this money was hidden. “Now the government cannot give a specific figure for this. But the RBI gave a proposal to the government and it came before the Cabinet, which approved the move,” Mr. Goyal said. “There is no curb on honestly-earned money. So nobody should have a problem,” he added. Responding to issues raised by the Opposition, Mr. Goyal said some people have been saying that seven or ten days’ time should have been given. “Secrecy is most important for such a step,” he added. Listing the benefits of the move, Mr. Goyal said interest rates will come down, inflation would be curbed and even the tax rate will come down. “If 5 people don’t pay tax, the brunt is borne by the rest of 95 per cent people. And if taxes are paid, there will be more money with the Centre to carry out welfare works for farmers, women, SC and ST sections,” he added. With regard to allegations that the move has been timed to benefit the BJP in the U.P. elections, he said such a statement itself implies that people support this step. To demands that the government should declare the names of people who have Swiss Bank accounts, Mr. Goyal said such a step will make it difficult for government to obtain more information about such accounts. But some people want the government to make the error of declaring these names and then it will have difficulty in getting this information, Mr. Goyal claimed.

Eight days after the notes were demonetised long queues are seen in front of banks’ branches on Tuesday. The new Rs. 500 notes are not yet released and people continue to face the hardship as they are not able to get change for the new Rs. 2000 note they have received in exchange for the old notes. In fact this is the main issue the people are complaining about as their patience seemed to be wearing out after facing hardships for more than a week. There were also allegations that persons having black money are trying to exchange the demonetised notes through petrol bunks. Apart from this the old Rs. 500 note is being given as balance for a Rs. 1000 note after a customer got his two-wheeler filled with petrol worth Rs. 500. This was experience of a bank employee. He received Rs. 500 in Rs.100 notes only after a brief argument with the employee of the petrol bunk. Smaller banks are not able to give the enhanced amount of Rs. 4,500 in exchange for old notes and the ATMs are not yet configured to issue the Rs. 2000 notes. Several ATMs are not functioning as the money is not being replenished. Pasumarthi Retail LLP has set up mobile ATMs near the SBI ATMs through which the customers have drawn currency notes of smaller denominations. The demonetisation has also hit the sale of tickets for the second cricket Test between England and India in the city and not many tickets are sold as Rs. 100 notes are not available in plenty. Meanwhile, Collector Pravin Kumar visited the Rytu Bazaar in MVP Colony and assured the customers and vegetable sellers that ePass system would be introduced to overcome the problem of non-availability of Rs. 100 denomination notes. Banks would be requested to open counters in the Rytu Bazaars. The CPI (M) took out a rally demanding the government to allow circulation of old Rs. 500 and Rs. 1000 notes till the Rs.100 and Rs. 50 notes are available sufficiently to the people.

338,2016-11-16,9.0,Demonetisation affects disbursal of crop loans,"The demonetisation of Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,000 currency notes has delivered a body blow to disbursal of crop loans through cooperative institutions in Tamil Nadu at a time when it is about to gather momentum. Village-level Primary Agricultural Cooperative Credit Societies (PACCS) draw funds from their accounts with District Central Cooperative Banks (DCCBs). Strictly speaking, they are not regarded as banks, even though they can accept deposits and issue loans. In Tamil Nadu, there are 4,480 PACCS, which during 2015-2016, mobilised Rs. 6,874.66 crore and disbursed loans to the tune of Rs. 19,409.52 crore. For all practical purposes, such societies are equated with any other “individual bank customer”. This means that each Primary Agricultural Cooperative Credit Society can draw only Rs. 24,000 per week from the DCCB concerned. Against this background, fulfilling the target set by the State government for the disbursal of crop loans of Rs. 6,000 crore through all societies becomes next to impossible, say officials. In 2015-2016, crop loans of about Rs.5,868 crore were disbursed, against the target of Rs. 5,500 crore. About 10.75 lakh farmers were benefited. This year, around 35 per cent of the targeted amount has been achieved. The disbursal will gather pace in the coming two months as farmers will be intensifying their operations during the current Samba season The officials are also wondering as to how to meet the deadline of November 30 to ensure that the crop loans are covered under the new crop insurance scheme — Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana. On the one hand, village-level cooperative societies are hamstrung by the demonetisation scheme. On the other hand, the deadline for coverage under the crop insurance scheme is approaching. What has complicated the situation further is the latest ban on the District Central Cooperative Banks accepting the demonetised notes of Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,000 for exchange or deposit. The RBI should exempt the village-level credit societies from various restrictions so that the latter’s operations are carried on smoothly, the officials explain.

  Strongly criticising the Central government’s decision to apply indelible ink marks on the fingers of people who exchange demonetised currency notes in banks, DMK treasurer M.K. Stalin on Tuesday such actions amounted to a government suspecting its citizens. He urged the Centre to immediately withdraw the decision. “The Centre’s move has created apprehensions in the minds of the people that a democratically elected government had deviated from its path. The dictatorial announcement of the government is highly condemnable. Prime Minister Narendra Modi took a pledge placing faith in 125 crore people of India, and now he has resorted to a move that has inflicted great suffering on them. It is unacceptable in a democratic country,” he said in a statement. Mr. Stalin said when Mr. Modi announced his plans of demonetisation of Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,000 notes to eradicate black money, people believed that the Finance Ministry and the Reserve Bank of India would have made adequate arrangements. “But subsequent developments have proved that the government has not done anything in advance for the smooth implementation of its plan.

With increasing demand for lower denomination currencies and customers preferring to cut down on cash purchases, small hotels, bakeries, and roadside eateries are seeing an impact on sales and hence are also exploring various payment options. For instance, Ranjith Kumar has two push carts out of which he sells fast food items near the VOC Park. His day starts at about 10 a.m. and business goes on till 8.30 p.m. and items are available from Rs. 20 a plate. As the day progresses, he gets lower denomination notes from the customers and even if customers pay Rs. 100, he is able to give them change. For the last one week, he offers Paytm option too to his customers. “Not many have used it so far. But, they ask about it. Customers can just pay using their phone,” he says. Senthil Nathan of Sri Sai Cafe, on Huzur Road, says there have been customers who offer Rs. 2,000 note and ask for change. “At least 50 customers give a Rs. 2,000 note and we are able to give change for just 15 or 20 customers,” he says. Since there is a huge rush for breakfast and lunch, it is difficult to use credit or debit cards. “But, we are looking at different options, such as pre-loaded cards or accepting cards only for dinner,” he says. At Aroma Bakery at Nehru Stadium, though cards are not accepted, customers pay by cash, even if it is just Rs. 50 or less. Some do give a Rs. 2000 note and ask for change. Small hotels, eateries and bakeries have seen the demonetisation affect business by nearly 50 per cent in the last one week. “Every business is related. If a labourer does not get his wages properly, he will not spend at an eatery. Even if the sales drop by Rs. 1,000 a day for a hotel, it has an impact as these are small-scale establishments, says C.K. Subramanian, president of the association for small hotels, mess, and bakeries here. However, “We are hopeful of the situation turning normal shortly,” he says.

Addressing a press conference here on Tuesday, federation national general secretary P.

The RBI directions were not in agreement with the Ministry of Finance clarification that all banking companies defined under the Banking Regulation Act shall implement the scheme. The DCCBs were licnesed banks and treated on a par with commercial banks so far as the banking business was concerned. The RBI would have to review its decision, he said. Mr. Balakrishnan said that the federation members would organise a protest in front of cooperative banks on November 18. Dharnas would be organised on November 22 and a one-day strike would be observed on November 25 to protest the decision.

Markets are closed in various places. People are unable to buy even bare essentials, life-saving medicines etc.” The statement echoed party general secretary Sitaram Yechury’s view that the measure does not address black money, corruption, counterfeit currency notes and terror funding. “Cash constitutes only six per cent of the black economy,” the release said. “... Also, the basic avenues for money laundering through participatory notes and diversions through tax havens remain untouched. There is no attempt to curb the roots of generation of black money such as in the real estate sector.” “The Government of India/RBI should allow district and primary cooperative banks also to accept and exchange Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,000 notes. This will provide much relief to people in the rural areas.” The CPI(M) demanded that till alternative arrangements like the availability of required currency notes and the recalibration of ATM machines are completed, people should be allowed to transact in old notes. The party termed signs of authoritarianism incidents such as the bid to slap a ban on NDTV India, the detention of Rahul Gandhi, Arvind Kejriwal and others while trying to meet family members of a retired Army man who committed suicide, the Delhi police action on JNU students protesting the disappearance of student Najeeb Ahmad after a dispute with the ABVP, murder charges against Delhi professors, a CPI(M) State leader and others in Chhattisgarh, and the encounter of eight alleged SIMI undertrials in Madhya Pradesh. “The Polit Bureau expressed concern over the escalating communal tension and consequent polarisation in the run-up to the Uttar Pradesh Assembly elections,” the statement added. “The BJP and the RSS are vigorously pursuing this agenda through various outfits and propagating divisive issues like gau raksha etc,” the CPI(M) said.

  The Supreme Court on Tuesday refused to stay the November 8 government notification demonetising Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,000 currency notes and asked the Centre to take immediate measures to alleviate the sufferings of the traumatised common man who is “forced” to stand in queues to withdraw a little bit of his own hard-earned money. “Tell us, instead of forcing citizens to stand in queues for his own money ... and it is traumatic for people to stand in lines for hours doing nothing, why can’t you raise their cash withdrawal limit to a reasonable one,” Chief Justice T.S. Thakur, who presided over a Bench that comprised Justice D.Y. Chandrachud, questioned the Centre. Noting that the court did not want to interfere with the government’s economic policy, Chief Justice Thakur said the objective of demonetisation might be a “surgical strike” on black money, but it should not cause hardship to the common man. Chief Justice Thakur summarised that while the government calls the demonestisation exercise a “surgical strike on black money,” senior advocate Kapil Sibal, appearing for one of the four petitioners, terms it a “carpet-bombing of the common man.” “Carpenters, masons, daily wage earners, maids, vegetable sellers are dependent on cash; we are only wondering if you are capable of doing anything to reduce the trauma of ordinary man,” Chief Justice Thakur asked Attorney-General Mukul Rohatgi. The Bench asked the Centre to file an affidavit by November 25, detailing the various measures it could take to lessen the hardship and inconvenience caused to people without hindering the larger objective of the government notification to get rid of black money and cross-border terror financing.

He discussed month-wise revenue collection from registrations, value added tax (VAT), excise, transport (motor vehicles) tax, non-tax revenue and monthly expenditure of the State government.

Janardhana Poojary, a former Union Minister of State for Finance, on Tuesday demanded the immediate withdrawal of the demonetisation scheme, failing which Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the BJP would have to pay huge a price. Mr. Poojary told reporters here that though the intent of the scheme was laudable, lack of preparations to roll it out has considerably affected the common man. The scheme was launched without any homework and without having adequate stock of alternative currencies, he said. He said that considering several “failed” promises of Mr. Modi, there is genuine doubt now whether everything would be all right by December 30.

Releasing a note here on Tuesday, K. Somshekhar, district secretary of SUCI, said that the Union government had suddenly banned the notes without taking any steps to address the problems of the poor people, who were standing in long queues outside banks and ATM's for the past several days. Reiterating that such an exercise (banning currency) won’t help eradicate corruption, Mr. Somshekhar said that instead it (the Centre’s action) had effected the financial status of the common man.

  Last weekend, several instances of panam payattu (also called kurikkalyanam) in Kozhikode, Malappuram and other north Kerala districts were cancelled. The reason — the scrapping of Rs.1,000 and Rs.500 notes. Panam Payattu is a traditional way of raising funds in the rural areas of these districts for building a house, marrying off a daughter or meeting a financial emergency. At the panam payattu event, held at a pre-scheduled venue and time (usually on weekends) by the needy person, people chip in for the cause with contributions of Rs.500 or its multiples. Many of last weekend’s payattu events had to be cancelled because people had no money to give. This is one of the myriad examples of how the demonetisation of high value currency notes is fast paralysing the rural economy. Fishers hit “I haven’t gone fishing for the past three days,” says Chekhov of Chelannur in Kozhikode. “People don’t have cash with them to pay for my fish.” The 66-year-old Chekhov and his colleagues make a living by fishing in the Pavayil Puzha, a tributary of Korappuzha River. The scooter-borne fish vendors, who buy fish regularly from Chekhov, have not shown up ever since the high value notes were demonetised. While 1000s and 500s are invalidated, 100s and 50s are hard to come by. Lottery ticket vendors and thattukada operators are among the worst-hit. An elderly lottery vendor at Atholi said he had hardly sold any tickets for the past five days. Real estate in trouble P. Uthaman of Kakkodi, a retired sub-registrar officer who is now a registered document writer, said a large network of people who made a living from the real estate sector were now in trouble. Registration of land, houses and flats had come down to a fourth as the stamp duty and the registration fee needed to be paid in hard currency. Only small transactions and registration of wills and leases were taking place. He said people in the rural areas who had hoped to get their land sold for meeting financial emergencies were tense. Artisans and semi-skilled workers, electricians and plumbers are all without an income now as people have postponed repairs to their houses. Cobblers, motorbike repairmen, mobile phone shop-owners, autorickshaw drivers and mini-lorry owners are underemployed. In the high-land areas of Kozhikode and Kannur districts, where small rubber plantations are aplenty, many rubber dealers’ shops remain shuttered as they don’t have the money to pay rubber producers. The economic paralysis triggered by demonetisation in the rural areas have made the people fear that the situation is only going to be worse.

With the cancellation of the Rs.500 and Rs.1000 notes, the Centre had taken steps to close the doors from all sides on black money. Special teams “Special teams have been deputed at Kakinada, Visakhapatnam, Krishnapatnam ports and the Inland Container Depot (ICD) located at Marripalem village in Guntur district. Likewise, security has been tightened at Gannavaram, Visakhapatnam, Rajahmundry and Renigunta airports too,” a senior Customs and Central Excise official told The Hindu. Officers had been asked to keep a tab on the foreign vessels and flights and screen the crew and the passengers thoroughly. Complaints “We are receiving many complaints on sale of gold. But the Customs Department will act only on the gold biscuits which are of foreign origin and which have foreign markings under Section 123 of Customs Act 1962. Customs and Central Excise do not have jurisdiction on Indian made gold and fine touch yellow metal,” said another officer of the Customs Department. However, we kept a vigil and the officials concerned had been instructed to focus on bullion traders, showrooms and money exchanging teams. The special teams would act on the complaints and the details of the informants would be kept confidential, the officer said. Anti-smuggling teams “We deal with smuggling of gold, foreign currency, cigarettes and some foreign goods. Anti-smuggling teams have been pressed into service along the coast as well as ports. We request the public to cooperate with the officials in checking smuggling,” the officer said.

Many pilgrims who talked to The Hindu here on Tuesday when the Ayyappa temple was opened for the two-month Mandalam-Makaravilakku pilgrimage season shared more or less the same thought. But, all of them said they had to struggle a lot to mobilise lower-denomination currency notes before embarking on their pilgrimage to Sabarimala. “Keeping more bundles of notes was another inconvenience we faced,’’ said another Guruswami from Karnataka. However, the traders at Pampa have reportedly started feeling the heat of the demonetisation. R. Ramachandran Nair, a hoteleer at Pampa, told The Hindu that shortage of lower-denomination currency was a major problem merchants of Sabarimala faced. Meanwhile, Dhanalakshmi Bank, the official bankers of the Travancore Devaswom Board, has opened special counters for currency exchange at Sabarimala Sannidhanam and at Pampa. P. Manikantan, Dhanalakshmi Bank general manager, said two ATMs had already been functioning at Sannidhanam and one at Pampa. The bank had arranged sufficient lower-denomination currency notes to meet the growing demand for the same at Sabarimala in the coming days. Mr. Manikantan said the bank was also exploring the possibility of installing more ATMs at Sabarimala, if the TDB allotted space for the same, and telecom connectivity. The State Bank of Travancore too has got an ATM each at Sannidhanam and Pampa that started functioning on Tuesday evening, according to bank sources.

  Strongly criticising the Central government’s decision to apply indelible ink marks on the fingers of people who exchange demonetised currency notes in banks, DMK treasurer M.K. Stalin on Tuesday such actions amounted to a government suspecting its citizens. He urged the Centre to immediately withdraw the decision. “The Centre’s move has created apprehensions in the minds of the people that a democratically elected government had deviated from its path. The dictatorial announcement of the government is highly condemnable. Prime Minister Narendra Modi took a pledge placing faith in 125 crore people of India, and now he has resorted to a move that has inflicted great suffering on them. It is unacceptable in a democratic country,” he said in a statement. Mr. Stalin said when Mr. Modi announced his plans of demonetisation of Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,000 notes to eradicate black money, people believed that the Finance Ministry and the Reserve Bank of India would have made adequate arrangements. “But subsequent developments have proved that the government has not done anything in advance for the smooth implementation of its plan. People are not able to draw money freely even from the ATMs,” he said. Mr. Stalin pointed out that the regular schedule of people was disrupted as they had been forced to stand in queues in front of banks and ATMs and daily wagers had borne the brunt of the government’s decision. Meets bank customers Earlier in the day; Mr Stalin had an interaction with customers of the State Bank of Travancore at Nallur in Thiruparankundram in Madurai district, who waited in a long queue to exchange their currencies. He was campaigning for the DMK candidate in the Thiruparankundram Assembly constituency and stopped his vehicle when he saw a queue of people outside the bank. They told him that the demonetisation process had caused enormous hardship and they were forced to wait for hours to exchange Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,000 notes. Mr. Stalin met the bank officials and gathered information about the difficulties in exchanging the old notes. He requested the officials to take measures to help people, said a DMK press release.

Eight days after the notes were demonetised long queues are seen in front of banks’ branches on Tuesday. The new Rs. 500 notes are not yet released and people continue to face the hardship as they are not able to get change for the new Rs. 2000 note they have received in exchange for the old notes. In fact this is the main issue the people are complaining about as their patience seemed to be wearing out after facing hardships for more than a week. There were also allegations that persons having black money are trying to exchange the demonetised notes through petrol bunks. Apart from this the old Rs. 500 note is being given as balance for a Rs. 1000 note after a customer got his two-wheeler filled with petrol worth Rs. 500. This was experience of a bank employee. He received Rs. 500 in Rs.100 notes only after a brief argument with the employee of the petrol bunk. Smaller banks are not able to give the enhanced amount of Rs. 4,500 in exchange for old notes and the ATMs are not yet configured to issue the Rs. 2000 notes. Several ATMs are not functioning as the money is not being replenished. Pasumarthi Retail LLP has set up mobile ATMs near the SBI ATMs through which the customers have drawn currency notes of smaller denominations. The demonetisation has also hit the sale of tickets for the second cricket Test between England and India in the city and not many tickets are sold as Rs. 100 notes are not available in plenty. Meanwhile, Collector Pravin Kumar visited the Rytu Bazaar in MVP Colony and assured the customers and vegetable sellers that ePass system would be introduced to overcome the problem of non-availability of Rs. 100 denomination notes. Banks would be requested to open counters in the Rytu Bazaars.

The commoners and the honest tax-paying citizens are among the worst hit , they said. They said similar demonetisation initiatives were taken up in 1946 and 1978 but they were not successful in curbing black money. Individuals with unaccounted for money would have invested them on land, gold and other avenues and rarely hold on to cash and hence the move was affecting the poor and the middle class, they said. “Which political or business big wig is standing in a queue in front of banks and ATMs ...?” questioned SUCI activists. Daily wagers are under stress owing to non-payment of wages in the absence of adequate currency notes. “The situation is grave in rural areas where banking network and penetration is low,” they added.

367,2016-11-16,9.0,Industries welcome demonetisation policy,"Various stakeholders in business and industries here have welcomed the demonetisation policy. Hailing the “bold initiative”, P.S.S.K. Raja Sankaralingam, former president, All India Chamber of Commerce and Industries, Thoothukudi, said it was a holistic approach towards development and to make India free from black money. He observed that though people had to face hardship for want of money to meet their daily expenses, the situation would improve as more avenues would be opened to withdraw money. The recent demonetisation policy had not affected the shipping industry. According to J.P. Joe Villavarayar, former chairman, Confederation of Indian Industry, Thoothukudi, cargo shipping operations had not been affected as payments were being made in the form of cheques. Moreover, the logistic supply operations, the key to shipping industry, remained unaffected as cargo trucks had been transporting shipments as usual. No toll charge was being levied on cargo trucks and other vehicles on national highways since the government had relaxed it till November 18. It was also a healthy sign that demonetised Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,000 notes would be accepted in all fuel stations for a certain period, he said. Suresh Nandanwar, Additional Commissioner of Customs, Tuticorin Custom House, told The Hindu that operations were normal in the Custom House as proceedings here were being done through online payment. Hailing the policy, K. Nehruprakash, vice-president, Thoothukudi District Tiny and Small-Scale Industries Association (THUDITSSIA), said the move would deliver long-term benefit for people. The demonetisation policy was expected to boost the economy and industrial raw material cost could be reduced possibly. However, he said that most of the ATMs remained closed and only a few had cash. Since people were accustomed to withdrawing money from the ATMs, they faced some problems but as the ceiling of cash withdrawal from banks had been revised, it had come as a welcome relief, he added. Reliable sources from banks here said many the ATMS required re-calibration and it would take a minimum of a week to restore normal operations. Cash was being fed in the ATMs based on priority considering its transactions. In banks, operations were predominantly on money exchange, cash deposits and remittance. Despite being understaffed, bankers were discharging their duty. Moreover, people had been asked not to handle others’ cash in banks and any such act would be penalised, sources said.

368,2016-11-16,9.0,Demonetisation affects disbursal of crop loans,"The demonetisation of Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,000 currency notes has delivered a body blow to disbursal of crop loans through cooperative institutions in Tamil Nadu at a time when it is about to gather momentum. Village-level Primary Agricultural Cooperative Credit Societies (PACCS) draw funds from their accounts with District Central Cooperative Banks (DCCBs). Strictly speaking, they are not regarded as banks, even though they can accept deposits and issue loans. In Tamil Nadu, there are 4,480 PACCS, which during 2015-2016, mobilised Rs. 6,874.66 crore and disbursed loans to the tune of Rs. 19,409.52 crore. For all practical purposes, such societies are equated with any other “individual bank customer”. This means that each Primary Agricultural Cooperative Credit Society can draw only Rs. 24,000 per week from the DCCB concerned. Against this background, fulfilling the target set by the State government for the disbursal of crop loans of Rs. 6,000 crore through all societies becomes next to impossible, say officials. In 2015-2016, crop loans of about Rs.5,868 crore were disbursed, against the target of Rs. 5,500 crore. About 10.75 lakh farmers were benefited. This year, around 35 per cent of the targeted amount has been achieved. The disbursal will gather pace in the coming two months as farmers will be intensifying their operations during the current Samba season The officials are also wondering as to how to meet the deadline of November 30 to ensure that the crop loans are covered under the new crop insurance scheme — Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana. On the one hand, village-level cooperative societies are hamstrung by the demonetisation scheme. On the other hand, the deadline for coverage under the crop insurance scheme is approaching. What has complicated the situation further is the latest ban on the District Central Cooperative Banks accepting the demonetised notes of Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,000 for exchange or deposit. The RBI should exempt the village-level credit societies from various restrictions so that the latter’s operations are carried on smoothly, the officials explain.

369,2016-11-16,9.0,Currency crisis hits small eateries,"The announcement on demonetisation of the existing Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,000 notes last week has changed the way daily business happens for several small hotels, roadside eateries, and bakeries in the city. With increasing demand for lower denomination currencies and customers preferring to cut down on cash purchases, small hotels, bakeries, and roadside eateries are seeing an impact on sales and hence are also exploring various payment options. For instance, Ranjith Kumar has two push carts out of which he sells fast food items near the VOC Park. His day starts at about 10 a.m. and business goes on till 8.30 p.m. and items are available from Rs. 20 a plate. As the day progresses, he gets lower denomination notes from the customers and even if customers pay Rs. 100, he is able to give them change. For the last one week, he offers Paytm option too to his customers. “Not many have used it so far. But, they ask about it. Customers can just pay using their phone,” he says. Senthil Nathan of Sri Sai Cafe, on Huzur Road, says there have been customers who offer Rs. 2,000 note and ask for change. “At least 50 customers give a Rs. 2,000 note and we are able to give change for just 15 or 20 customers,” he says. Since there is a huge rush for breakfast and lunch, it is difficult to use credit or debit cards. “But, we are looking at different options, such as pre-loaded cards or accepting cards only for dinner,” he says. At Aroma Bakery at Nehru Stadium, though cards are not accepted, customers pay by cash, even if it is just Rs. 50 or less. Some do give a Rs. 2000 note and ask for change. Small hotels, eateries and bakeries have seen the demonetisation affect business by nearly 50 per cent in the last one week. “Every business is related. If a labourer does not get his wages properly, he will not spend at an eatery. Even if the sales drop by Rs. 1,000 a day for a hotel, it has an impact as these are small-scale establishments, says C.K. Subramanian, president of the association for small hotels, mess, and bakeries here. However, “We are hopeful of the situation turning normal shortly,” he says.

He confirmed that the members presented a slew of demands, chief among them being to allow cooperative banks to accept old currency notes. “The Minister has received complaints from rural areas, including from former deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar, who had said that cooperative banks are not doing any transactions whatsoever,” a senior Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) minister said. Sources said several ministers had expressed similar concerns at the State Cabinet meeting on Tuesday. “We have asked the Chief Minister to allow use of old notes at the APMC markets so that perishable goods are not affected. We have also asked the CM to allow school students to pay fees late,” said another minister. The Cabinet discussed the existing situation; this was followed by a presentation by finance secretary D.K. Jain. The sub-committee assigned to study the problems faced by the people will submit a report to the Centre. The committee consisting of Mr. Mungantiwar, Agriculture Minister Pandurang Phundkar, Transport Minister Diwakar Raote, Health Minister Deepak Sawant, Education Minister Vinod Tawde and Industries Minister Subhash Desai, discussed fallout of demonetisation on the agriculture markets and insurance/loans to farmers. “There is a growing concern among farmers and traders that it is important for the government to take steps. We will communicate these to the Centre,” said a senior minister.

| Photo Credit: V_GANESAN The pilgrim rush continues at the world-famous Lord Venkateswara temple even after the demonetisation of high-value currency by the Centre. Offerings too continue to pour into the hundi. The hill town has recorded over 5.13 lakh footfalls in the last eight days aggregating an average of 64,176 pilgrims per day. Likewise, the hundi has also registered a whopping income of over Rs. 22.9 crore. But several other renowned temples in the State have been hit hard. A report by the Endowments Department suggests that there is a decline by 10-25 per cent in the number of people undertaking pilgrimages to various places of worship. The temple at Sri Kalahasti has reported a drastic decline in the number of devotees performing the ‘Rahu-Kethu’ pooja – to which the devout attach immense significance, and the Srisailam temple has recorded an erosion by over 20 per cent in the number of pilgrims. Meanwhile, speculation continues to persist that the Tirumala temple which is known for its vast riches, will remain the ultimate beneficiary of the withdrawal of the legal tender status for Rs.500 and Rs.1,000 currency notes. The hundi, which nets an income of more than Rs. 1,000 crore in the form of offerings in addition to about one tonne of gold and three to four tonnes of silver articles year among other valuables, in all probability is expected to receive voluminous deposits either during the last couple of weeks of December when the deadline for exchange and deposits of the old currency notes expires or by the end of March as specified by the Reserve Bank of India.

372,2016-11-17,10.0,Banks take measures to ease currency crunch at Sabarimala,"The difficulties faced by pilgrims at Sabarimala on account of demonetisation are on the wane, thanks to precautionary measures taken by Dhanlaxmi Bank,which is the official banker of the Travancore Devaswom Board, and the State Bank of Travancore. The Dhanlaxmi Bank has opened an additional ATM at the Lower Tirumuttom of the Ayyappa temple taking its total number ATMs to three at Sabarimala alone, besides the one at Pampa. P. Manikantan, Dhanlaxmi Bank General Manager, and M.P. Sreekumar, Assistant General Manager, told The Hindu that the bank had kept ready lower denomination currencies worth Rs. 6 crore at its currency exchange counters at Sabarimala. Debit and credit card swiping machines have been provided at all the Prasadom counters at Sabarimala and Pampa to minimise the problems faced by the pilgrims, they said. Mr. Sreekumar said an additional currency exchange has been opened at Sabarimala for exchanging the higher denomination notes with lower denomination currencies. The rush of people for currency exchange too has come down, suggesting the easing situation, he said. The SBT sources said the functioning of the bank’s two ATM counters at Pampa and Sannidhanam was disrupted till Wednesday afternoon owing to certain connectivity problems. However, the defects were rectified and the machines started functioning from Thursday afternoon, they said. Dhanlaxmi Bank sources said almost 80 per cent of the currencies offered by the devotees as ‘Kaanikka’ at Sabarimala were Rs. 50, Rs. 20 and Rs. 10 notes. What the pilgrims say? “We came in a group of 23 pilgrims from Salem in Tamil Nadu. Anticipating a possible shortage of lower currency notes at Sabarimala, we have mobilised lower denomination currencies worth Rs. 40,000 before embarking on the pilgrimage,’’ says 54-year-Venkitaraman, a Postal Department staff. He said the petrol pumps and a good number of shops in Salem accepted Rs. 1,000 and Rs. 500 notes. But, here in Kerala, the situation is different and difficult as a majority of shops and eateries refused to do so. Rajeshkumar and Tirumal from Thiruvannamala too shared a similar view. Midhun and Renjith from Thrissur said they had not felt any difficulty in terms of currency shortage at Sabarimala. “We strongly support the Prime Minister’s initiative to curb black money,’’ they said. Unni from Perinad, a priest at the Balithara on the banks of river Pampa, said pilgrims who offered Balitharpanam had got sufficient stock of lower denomination currencies. He said the Balithara has been receiving plenty of Rs. 10, and Rs. 50 notes towards dakshina from the pilgrims.

373,2016-11-17,10.0,"Acute shortage of currency, small change in district","A long line of customers at the State Bank of India branch at Menaka in the city on Sunday, even before the start of banking hours, to exchange currency notes.
  KOCHI: Nine days after the demonetisation of high-value currency notes, ATMs in the district continued to run dry, in most cases, on Thursday, while banks in the district faced severe shortage of small value currency. “Only around 30 per cent of the 1,400 ATMs [not counting those operated by cooperative banks] in the district dispensed money on Thursday, as there was acute shortage of currency notes of Rs.50 and Rs.100 denominations. Meanwhile, some recalibrated ATMs dispensed Rs.2,000, which people found useless for want of change,” Bank Employees Federation of India State general secretary S.S. Anil said. Sources indicated that while nearly 70 per cent of ATMs operated by the State Bank of India and associates functioned intermittently, banks that had outsourced ATM operations failed to load cash. ATMs located on bank branch premises dispensed cash, but standalone ones largely remained cashless, which was apparent from the absence of queues at several places. “While there was talk of the new Rs.500 notes making it to banks, they are yet to reach. Besides, the new Rs.2,000 notes, there were primarily Rs.20 and Rs.10 notes in mostly soiled and crumpled condition. So was the case with most Rs.100 and Rs.50 notes,” they said. All Kerala Bank Employees Federation general secretary and State convenor of United Forum of Bank Unions C.D. Josson said soiled notes and acute shortage of small change posed problems on Thursday. “There was a clear drop in the number of people turning up to exchange demonetised notes. Use of stained, torn, and soiled notes was the order of the day,” he added. Mr. Anil said demonetisation had almost arrested lending, and that business transactions had dropped by nearly 70 per cent over the last week. “The use of indelible ink was also sporadic. Most private banks, where cash, mostly of Rs.2,000 notes, was available, did not receive the ink,” he added. The non-availability of small change forced people to form ‘informal currency’ in the form of small promise notes. Environmentalist Purushan Eloor posted on Facebook a picture of a piece of paper with Rs.1,700 written in hand and sealed by a fuel outlet. He had given a single currency of Rs.2,000 and filled petrol for Rs.300. For want of change, the pump gave him the paper, asking him to collect the money in exchange for the slip in the evening. Some small shops outside the city had displayed notices saying they did not take Rs.2,000 for want of change.

376,2016-11-17,10.0,Govt. seeks SC stay on demonetisation cases in other courts,"The Centre on Thursday urged the Supreme Court to stay multiple proceedings instituted in various High Courts and lower courts against demonetisation of Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,000 currency notes. Appearing for the Centre before a Bench led by Justice Anil R. Dave, Attorney-General Mukul Rohatgi submitted that when the Supreme Court was already seized of the matter, other courts should not preside over separate litigation on an identical issue. The Supreme Court had, earlier this week, refused to stay the November 8 notification demonetising Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,000 notes. It had however asked the Centre to take immediate measures to alleviate the hardships of the common man who is “forced” to stand in queues to withdraw a little bit of his own hard-earned money. “Instead of forcing citizens to stand in queues for his own money ... and it is traumatic for people to stand in lines for hours doing nothing, why can’t you raise their cash withdrawal limit to a reasonable one?” Chief Justice T.S. Thakur, who presided over a Bench that comprised Justice D.Y. Chandrachud, had questioned the Centre. Noting that the apex court did not want to interfere with the government’s economic policy, Chief Justice Thakur had said the objective of demonetisation might be a “surgical strike” on black money, but it should not cause hardship to the common man.

  The Rajya Sabha on Thursday witnessed a sharp clash between the Opposition and the ruling sides after Leader of Opposition Ghulam Nabi Azad made certain comments linking the Uri terror attack casualties to the deaths during the demonetisation “crisis”. The Treasury benches termed the remark as “anti-national” and wanted an apology from the Congress. Heated exchanges broke out between the Treasury and Opposition benches after Mr. Azad said 40 people had died following the government’s decision on demonetisation and that these many casualties had not occurred even in the terror attack on the Uri Army camp. Eighteen Army personnel were killed in that attack. “Who should be punished” for the death of these 40 people which occurred due to the “wrong policy” on demonetisation, he asked and added that “millions of people are troubled. BJP and Government is responsible”. This comment by Mr. Azad drew massive protests from BJP members with Information and Broadcasting Minister M. Venkaiah Naidu saying the remarks are “anti-national”. An angry Mr. Naidu said Pakistan would use these comments against India and that the Congress should apologise for it.

380,2016-11-17,10.0,Demonetisation should be used to reform election financing,"Prabhat Singh Any serious attempt at curbing the scourge of black money in India must involve reforming election financing, which has rightly been termed the >root of corruption. In the absence of state-funding of elections, most parties and candidates support electioneering through massive amounts of black money in cash, amassed through donations from corporates and rich donors. Post-elections, the winning candidates and parties unduly favour their donors. In wake of demonetisation, the PM urged discussions on state-funding of elections. So far, parties have successfully resisted all such attempts. However, demonetisation has enfeebled them by hitting their black money finances hard. This presents the PM with the best chance to institute state-funding of elections, and thus carry out one of the most significant anti-corruption reforms in the history of independent India. How bad is the problem? Estimates say nearly $5billion was pumped into 2014 Lok Sabha elections, most of which was black money. Such gargantuan sums of money, coupled with the fact that there is visible involvement of some corporates in the campaign, gives an >appearance of corruption. State-funding is a staple of election financing in countries with the fairest elections. In India, the void is filled by illicit corporate donations, resulting in quid pro quo post-elections. A dysfunctional system of election financing is also major cause of criminalisation of Indian politics – in the absence of state support, funds must be managed from somewhere, and more muscle usually ensures more money. An overview of the existing rot Before one gets to ways of correcting the morass, it’s essential to have an overview of the system of election financing in India. The system is two-tiered – based on parties and candidates. The parties are required to disclose income but not expenditure, while it’s the other way round for candidates. The parties, whose main source of income comes from donations by individuals and corporations, use loopholes in the law to avoid disclosing identities of even the big individual donors. As regards corporate donations, despite the availability of tax breaks, most of it is done off-the-books mainly to avoid reprisals in case the opposing party wins. On the other hand, the candidates grossly underreport expenditure while actually spending far higher than the legal limits allow. Most of the illegal spending by candidates comes from the assistance given to them by their parties which carry greater financial heft, and have no ceiling on expenditure. A new model Before state-funding can be instituted to reduce the pernicious influence of black money on elections, two questions need to be answered: 1. How will finances be distributed amongst the various parties, and between a party and its candidates? 2. How will the Indian political parties, devoid of intra-party democracy, make judicious use of the money and select the right candidates? Various committees in the past have tried dealing with the above questions, but have come up short. Usually the committees have recommended making vote share of previous elections the criteria for fund distribution. However, this would be grossly unfair to new parties as well as to the non-incumbents in case there’s an anti-incumbency wave. It might also induce complacency in parties with a high vote share. Other committees have remained non-committal about state funding due to lack of intra-party democracy. Answering the questions The answer to the two questions lies in the “matching funds” model that provides state funding based on collection of small-sum grassroots donations, which is being successfully implemented in New York, Netherlands, Germany, and several other geographies. Such a model would provide state funds to both candidates and parties based on the amount they collect from citizens, as long as contributions can be verified to be authentic. Those with greater public support, denoted by the greater funds they collect, will be entitled to more state funds. This will have to be done in steps so that funds from one round can be used to raise more in the next round. At the end of each round of fund-raising, expenditure >receipts for the total amount (donations+matching grant) would have to be furnished. If some money is unutilised, it would have to be returned, barring which the candidate would face severe penalties. This would minimise wastage of public money and encourage people to donate. The money for each candidate and party would have to be deposited in a separate account to allow Election Commission oversight. To weed out fake/perfunctory candidates and parties, a floor (minimum limit) on the number of donors as well as the total amount raised, must be set. Similarly, a ceiling (maximum limit) on the amount of each donation would reduce the influence of rich donors. The exact parameters will have to be arrived at through wide-ranging consultations. Matching grants would also ensure accountability of parties and candidates to their electorate throughout, because only that would make people part with their money when elections approach. Without the need for legislation, giving matching funds to candidates would boost intra-party democracy by empowering those that have grassroots appeal. This would also help decriminalise politics. At the same time, matching funds to parties would ensure balance of power between them and their candidates. Higher funds can be allotted to parties that promote intraparty democracy and women candidates. To ensure day-to-day activities of parties between elections can run smoothly without the need for black money, the ratio of matching grants can be higher for them than for the candidates. Calculations can be done based on existing estimates, keeping in mind that the ratio should not be so high as to allow excess funds to parties that could be rerouted to candidates, which would draw candidates away from grassroots donations. Alternatively or in addition, parties can be allowed to get matching grants for funds raised between elections too. If this happens, the ratio of matching grants for parties can be moderated. Funds given for non-electioneering purposes would have to be maintained in a separate account. This model would help scale up what AAP employed to fund Delhi elections. In the absence of matching grants, it’s unlikely that grassroots donations alone will raise enough resources to compete on a multi-state/national scale. To scale up AAP’s model, matching grants are a must. Since the tradition of fund-raising is nascent in India, awareness drives must be complemented by tax breaks and other incentives to encourage common citizens to donate. Given that grassroots donations might be limited initially, the ratio of matching grants would have to be higher than 1 (it’s 6 in NYC). This would ensure parties and candidates are sufficiently empowered to contest and also avoid the easier path of receiving illicit funds from corporates. The ratio can be reduced for donations above a threshold to prevent wastage of public money on already rich candidates. To encourage women candidates, the ratio of matching funds for them can be raised. By reducing governmental dependence on corporate money, state-funding would also incentivize deregulation of economy, since a regulated economy ensures corporates are beholden to the government. Difficulties This model, however, is not devoid of implementation >issues. Firstly, since each contribution must be verifiable, cash donations won’t qualify for matching grants unless accompanied by authentic receipts. This means that a lot of donors, who can’t donate through verifiable means (cheque/card etc.) are ruled out too. However, as things like universal financial inclusion, Aadhar and Unified Payments Interface (UPI) become reality, the EC and government should embark on massive awareness drives to encourage everyone to donate through verifiable means. Secondly, candidates might try to >reroute their black money through donations. However, given extant robust verification systems, this shouldn’t be a huge problem. Thirdly, verifying a large number of donations and making sure candidates and parties receive funds in time to smoothly run their campaign would raise administrative barriers, but in no way should be a deal-breaker. Limiting expenditure Acknowledging the fact that expenditure ceilings on candidates are almost always violated, they should be removed. Instead, in order to quell temptation to receive black money for electioneering, avenues for expenditure – ads, rallies – should be restricted, as they’re in countries like Germany, where elections are a rather staid affair. Restricting mega rallies by party leaders and ads with their faces plastered all over them would also help restore the accountability of candidates, and reduce the increasingly presidential nature of Indian elections. In addition, campaign cycle should be shortened. Despite the difficulties, this model gives satisfactory answers to both the questions posed earlier, and given its feasibility, should overcome resistance from political parties.

381,2016-11-17,10.0,Demonetisation should be used to reform election financing,"Prabhat Singh Any serious attempt at curbing the scourge of black money in India must involve reforming election financing, which has rightly been termed the root of corruption. In the absence of state-funding of elections, most parties and candidates support electioneering through massive amounts of black money in cash, amassed through donations from corporates and rich donors. Post-elections, the winning candidates and parties unduly favour their donors. In wake of demonetisation, the PM urged discussions on state-funding of elections. So far, parties have successfully resisted all such attempts. However, demonetisation has enfeebled them by hitting their black money finances hard. This presents the PM with the best chance to institute state-funding of elections, and thus carry out one of the most significant anti-corruption reforms in the history of independent India. How bad is the problem? Estimates say nearly $5billion was pumped into 2014 Lok Sabha elections, most of which was black money. Such gargantuan sums of money, coupled with the fact that there is visible involvement of some corporates in the campaign, gives an appearance of corruption. State-funding is a staple of election financing in countries with the fairest elections. In India, the void is filled by illicit corporate donations, resulting in quid pro quo post-elections. A dysfunctional system of election financing is also major cause of criminalisation of Indian politics – in the absence of state support, funds must be managed from somewhere, and more muscle usually ensures more money. An overview of the existing rot Before one gets to ways of correcting the morass, it’s essential to have an overview of the system of election financing in India. The system is two-tiered – based on parties and candidates. The parties are required to disclose income but not expenditure, while it’s the other way round for candidates. The parties, whose main source of income comes from donations by individuals and corporations, use loopholes in the law to avoid disclosing identities of even the big individual donors. As regards corporate donations, despite the availability of tax breaks, most of it is done off-the-books mainly to avoid reprisals in case the opposing party wins. On the other hand, the candidates grossly underreport expenditure while actually spending far higher than the legal limits allow. Most of the illegal spending by candidates comes from the assistance given to them by their parties which carry greater financial heft, and have no ceiling on expenditure. A new model Before state-funding can be instituted to reduce the pernicious influence of black money on elections, two questions need to be answered: 1. How will finances be distributed amongst the various parties, and between a party and its candidates? 2. How will the Indian political parties, devoid of intra-party democracy, make judicious use of the money and select the right candidates? Various committees in the past have tried dealing with the above questions, but have come up short. Usually the committees have recommended making vote share of previous elections the criteria for fund distribution. However, this would be grossly unfair to new parties as well as to the non-incumbents in case there’s an anti-incumbency wave. It might also induce complacency in parties with a high vote share. Other committees have remained non-committal about state funding due to lack of intra-party democracy. Answering the questions The answer to the two questions lies in the “matching funds” model that provides state funding based on collection of small-sum grassroots donations, which is being successfully implemented in New York, Netherlands, Germany, and several other geographies. Such a model would provide state funds to both candidates and parties based on the amount they collect from citizens, as long as contributions can be verified to be authentic. Those with greater public support, denoted by the greater funds they collect, will be entitled to more state funds. This will have to be done in steps so that funds from one round can be used to raise more in the next round. At the end of each round of fund-raising, expenditure receipts for the total amount (donations+matching grant) would have to be furnished. If some money is unutilised, it would have to be returned, barring which the candidate would face severe penalties. This would minimise wastage of public money and encourage people to donate. The money for each candidate and party would have to be deposited in a separate account to allow Election Commission oversight. To weed out fake/perfunctory candidates and parties, a floor (minimum limit) on the number of donors as well as the total amount raised, must be set. Similarly, a ceiling (maximum limit) on the amount of each donation would reduce the influence of rich donors. The exact parameters will have to be arrived at through wide-ranging consultations. Matching grants would also ensure accountability of parties and candidates to their electorate throughout, because only that would make people part with their money when elections approach. Without the need for legislation, giving matching funds to candidates would boost intra-party democracy by empowering those that have grassroots appeal. This would also help decriminalise politics. At the same time, matching funds to parties would ensure balance of power between them and their candidates. Higher funds can be allotted to parties that promote intraparty democracy and women candidates. To ensure day-to-day activities of parties between elections can run smoothly without the need for black money, the ratio of matching grants can be higher for them than for the candidates. Calculations can be done based on existing estimates, keeping in mind that the ratio should not be so high as to allow excess funds to parties that could be rerouted to candidates, which would draw candidates away from grassroots donations. Alternatively or in addition, parties can be allowed to get matching grants for funds raised between elections too. If this happens, the ratio of matching grants for parties can be moderated. Funds given for non-electioneering purposes would have to be maintained in a separate account. This model would help scale up what AAP employed to fund Delhi elections.

  The government on Thursday rejected the demand for Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s response to the debate on demonetisation and accused the Opposition of using it as an excuse to scuttle discussion on the issue in Parliament. Information and Broadcasting Minister M. Venkaiah Naidu told reporters after Parliament was adjourned for the day, amid protests by Opposition demanding Mr. Modi’s presence, that the reply to the debate would be given by the Minister concerned or any other person on behalf of the government as per the rules of the House and precedents. The Opposition disrupted the Rajya Sabha, stalling midway the discussion on demonetisation that started on Wednesday. A united opposition’s relentless demand for a debate on demonetisation under a rule which entails voting forced the adjournment of the Lok Sabha also for the day as the government refused to accept it. “Half way through, they realised that by raising such a debate it is going negative on them and boomeranging. Now I am afraid, are they trying to find a way out to come out of this and then stall the debate on one pretext or the other,” Mr. Naidu said. Dubbing the uproar by the Congress and other Opposition parties as an “excuse” to stall a debate, Mr. Naidu alleged that there is no rationale, whatsoever, behind it. The Minister said things will happen as per the rules and procedures of the House and urged that the debate should go on. “I feel that those who started the debate are now understanding that it is going negative, that is why they are finding excuse for not allowing the discussion. “They are speaking in double tone and in different voices. They are not coming out openly either for or against. They are in dilemma and that dilemma will continue,” he said. Mr. Naidu said the entire country is watching as to who are with the hoarders and with the people with black money and who are with the government and the Prime Minister, who has “taken such a revolutionary step. They have to make a choice”. “Let the discussion take place. Then who will reply in the government. It could be the concerned Minister. The solution will come through the government as per traditions and rules,” he said. Mr. Naidu said government is addressing the problems faced by people on demonetisation and any suggestion, if worth considering, will be take up positively. “Government is open to ideas to improve the system. But if somebody is trying to question this and attribute motives, then people are there to finally come to an assessment and decide. Let every party decide are they in favour of this move or against it, for which they have no answer directly,” the Minister said.

Addressing a rally at Azadpur Mandi in Delhi, Mamata Banerjee gave an ultimatum to Centre to withdraw the scheme in three days reasoning that demonetisation will take the country backward by 100 years. ""The crisis of this proportion was not seen even during the Emergency,"" she said. Taking a jibe at Mr. Modi, she said people are talking about plastic economy just because they have travelled few countries. ""What do they know about economy? People are dying here and they say it is a surgical strike on black money,"" she said. She added that the PM should stand in line with people to understand their pain. She also clarified that she is against black money but doesn't agree with the methods adopted by the Centre. Joining her on the stage, Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal launched a blistering attack against the Centre. He said that demonetisation is the biggest scam of Independent India. ""People will deposit Rs.10 lakh crore and Modiji will waive off loans amounting to Rs.8 lakh crore given to his corporate friends,"" he claimed. Till date, around 40 people have died while standing in queues. ""Is this patriotism according to Mr. Modiji? Who is responsible for the death of these people?"" he asked. Talking about the situation of traders in the city, he said that Azadpur Mandi was one of the busiest wholesale market with shops stocked with fruits and vegetable. ""But ever since the demonetisation scheme was announced, it is seeing a downfall and now it wears a deserted look. There is no circulation money in the market,"" he reasoned. After the rally both, Mr. Kejriwal and Ms. Banerjee, went to meet the RBI Governor to discuss the “ill-effects of demonetisation“.

  The Centre on Thursday sought the Supreme Court to stay multiple proceedings instituted in various High Courts and lower courts against government's demonetisation of Rs. 500 and Rs. 1000 notes. Attorney-General Mukul Rohatgi, appearing for the Centre, said when the Supreme Court is already seized of the matter, other courts should not preside over separate litigation on identical issue. The Supreme Court had earlier this week refused to stay the November 8 government notification demonetising Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,000 notes. It however asked the Centre to take immediate measures to alleviate the hardships and sufferings of the traumatised common man who is “forced” to stand in queues to withdraw a little bit of his own hard-earned money. “Tell us, instead of forcing citizens to stand in queues for his own money... and it is traumatic for people to stand in lines for hours doing nothing, why can't you raise their cash withdrawal limit to a reasonable one?” Chief Justice T.S. Thakur, who presided over a Bench that comprised Justice D.Y. Chandrachud, had questioned the Centre. Noting that the apex court does not want to interfere with the government's economic policy, Chief Justice Thakur had said the objective of demonetisation may be a ""surgical strike"" on black money, but it should not cause hardship to the common man.

  As the rest of the country remains in a turmoil due to the demonetisation of the 500 and 1,000 rupees currency notes, people in Kashmir have accepted the move without any panic. “No common Kashmiri keeps large amounts of cash at home because of the disturbed situation,” said Elizabeth Maryam who teaches economics in Kashmir University. “The salaried class gets monthly wages through bank accounts and they usual space withdrawals to suit daily needs.” “The skilled and unskilled workers mostly earn as much as they spend on an average. Big industrialists and businessmen never keep large amounts of cash at home in the conflict ridden area. That is the reason why the demonetisation has had little impact in Kashmir,” Maryam added. According to Nazir Qazi, an officer of the local Jammu and Kashmir Bank, all the ATMs of the bank are fully stocked. “For the last eight days there has been no rush on either our branches or at our ATM outlets.” “Yes, people have been coming in for exchange of the demonetised currency notes or for deposit, but nobody was being hassled,” he added. Muzaffar Ahmad, a college principal, said: “In a place where the protest shutdown has paralysed life for over four months, who would shoot up their blood pressure further over cash crunch?” However, people have criticised official claims that the demonetisation move has reduced stone pelting or militancy in the valley. “The Defence Minister (Manohar Parrikar) has said stone pelting ended because of demonetisation. That is something nobody can accept in Kashmir,” said Zahoor Ahmad, 55, a local contractor “Do you want us to believe that a youth is ready to be killed with a bullet or be blinded with a pellet because the separatists give him a 500 rupees note? That is absurd,” he said Intelligence officials, however, believe that using fake currency notes is part of the ongoing militancy and doing the same with the new currency notes would not take long.

According to Nazir Qazi, an officer of the local Jammu and Kashmir Bank, all the ATMs of the bank are fully stocked. “For the last eight days there has been no rush on either our branches or at our ATM outlets.” “Yes, people have been coming in for exchange of the demonetised currency notes or for deposit, but nobody was being hassled,” he added. Muzaffar Ahmad, a college principal, said: “In a place where the protest shutdown has paralysed life for over four months, who would shoot up their blood pressure further over cash crunch?” However, people have criticised official claims that the demonetisation move has reduced stone pelting or militancy in the valley. “The Defence Minister (Manohar Parrikar) has said stone pelting ended because of demonetisation. That is something nobody can accept in Kashmir,” said Zahoor Ahmad, 55, a local contractor “Do you want us to believe that a youth is ready to be killed with a bullet or be blinded with a pellet because the separatists give him a 500 rupees note? That is absurd,” he said Intelligence officials, however, believe that using fake currency notes is part of the ongoing militancy and doing the same with the new currency notes would not take long.

  The Puducherry unit of the Communist Party of India (Marxist) staged a demonstration at Chinnakadai on Mahatma Gandhi Road here on Wednesday, in protest against the Centre’s demonetisation move. Terming the demonetisation of the Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,000 notes as ‘unplanned’, veteran CPI (M) leader T. Murugan said that the Government had taken no steps to ensure adequate supply of the new Rs. 500 and Rs. 2,000 notes, adding that the Centre had failed to curb black money and the move had caused inconvenience to the common man. Mr. Murugan demanded that the public be allowed to make transactions using the old notes to meet their daily expenses until alternative arrangements are put in place. The party also called for increasing the daily withdrawal limit and ensuring sufficient supply of currency in all ATMs. Meanwhile, the Chambre De Commerce has urged the Union Government to ensure adequate supply of lower denomination notes through banks and ATMs in the city. In a release, K.A. Shenbakarajan, president of Chambre De Commerce, said that the demonetisation move was implemented by the Centre without taking proper precautions and planning. Tourism, which is the city’s mainstay, has been affected due to shortage of cash since November 8. The Government should take steps to address the issue at the earliest, he said.

A mobile currency exchange van has been pressed into service to Government Hospitals, maternity homes, tribal areas, hamlets in the foot hills and remote villages in the region to help the public exchange Rs. 500 and Rs. 1000 denomination notes by producing the prescribed documents. Postmaster General for western region Sharda Sampath told The Hindu that on Wednesday, 83 applications were received at the camp at Coimbatore Medical College Hospital and Rs. 3.5 lakh was the amount that was exchanged. Apart from the currency exchange facility at the post offices, the mobile unit was planned to reach out to the public. At the Government hospital, there will be several patients and their relatives who would want to exchange the demonetised currencies. Hence, it was decided to have a camp at the hospital here on Wednesday and Thursday. “The number of days that the camp will be held at a location depends on the need in that area and also on availability of cash,” she said. The decision to conduct a mobile camp is taken at the local level, depending on the money availability for that post office. A camp was held at Yercaud on Tuesday. The public will have to bring the right identity card to benefit from these camps, she said.

394,2016-11-17,10.0,Demonetisation: Opposition divided over strategy,"A majority of the Opposition parties are united in their belief that the demonetisation move is causing great hardship to the poor and vulnerable, but the Trinamool Congress is possibly the only political party seeking a complete rollback. This became clear when Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee — who led a protest march to Rashtrapati Bhavan on demonetisation — was accompanied only by the National Conference, a rebel AAP MP and the Shiv Sena, which made it clear that it did not want a rollback. These differences between the Trinamool and other Opposition parties on demonetisation — the Congress, the Left parties, the Rashtriya Janata Dal, the Janata Dal-United, the Samajwadi Party and the Bahujan Samaj Party — will play out over the next few days. For instance, the Congress-led group sought a Joint Parliamentary Committee and an adjournment motion in the Lok Sabha and a discussion under Rule 267 in the Rajya Sabha. The government promptly accepted it as it gave it the opportunity to present the demonetisation measure to a wider audience as one that would cleanse the economy. While the Congress-led group will discuss their next move on Thursday morning, Ms. Banerjee has already decided that her party will seek a discussion under Rule 168 — that allows for voting — in the RS on the same subject a notice has already been submitted, Trinamool sources said, adding the party was planning on moving an adjournment motion in the Lok Sabha. The Trinamool clearly wishes to assume a leadership role, unfazed by the barbs being directed against it that its belligerence is a way of masking the Sarada-Narada scams in West Bengal. For Ms. Banerjee, who won a second term in the state earlier this year, would like the Opposition charge against the BJP in 2019. Meanwhile, the Congress-led group is still assessing whether Prime Minister Modi’s appeal is working or not before it raises the pitch further.

395,2016-11-17,10.0,TASMAC loses Rs 100 crore to demonetisation,"TASMAC has lost revenue of about Rs. 100 crore, post demonetisation. From November 9 to 13, the cash cow of Tamil Nadu on an average lost Rs. 15 crore per day. On November 14 and 15, the loss was pegged at Rs. 11 crore per day. TASMAC sells liquor worth Rs. 67-70 crore per day through its 6,195 outlets across the State. On weekends, the sales shoot up to Rs. 90 crore. During the festive season, particularly Deepavali, Christmas and New Year, sales touches Rs. 100 crore on a single day. TASMAC Managing Director Kirlosh Kumar could not be reached for his comments. Another senior official in TASMAC, said, “Tipplers stayed away from TASMAC counters since the demonetisation announcement. We had given instructions to our managers and salesmen not to accept Rs. 500 or Rs. 1,000.” A senior union member said, “There was a lull for the first three days. People panicked about spending whatever cash they had with them,” he said, adding that on the fourth and fifth days people had Rs 2,000 notes, but there was no change at the counter to pay them back, and therefore they refused to take the notes. A manager at one of the TASMAC outlets in Chennai, said, “Some units had good business because they accepted Rs 500 and Rs 1,000, despite the orders. Some outlets managed to deposit the old currency at their banks.” A total of 13 managers and supervisors with whom The Hindu spoke to in Chennai, unanimously said that demonetisation was the main reason for the dip in sales, but there was another reason for the revenue loss as well —short supply of liquor in the State. Beer and Indian Made Foreign Liquor from United Breweries, which holds 30 per cent market share in the liquor market have gone out of shelves. The company’s brands have not been available in the market from October 1. In the Tiruchi region, liquor sales dropped by about 35-40 per cent. At one outlet near Central Bus stand in Tiruchi, which sells liquor worth Rs 2.7 lakh per day, sales was only to the tune of Rs 1 lakh after the Centre’s announcement. On Wednesday, the same shop registered sales of Rs. 2.5 lakh, restoring trade, according to a source. Coimbatore, which sells liquor worth Rs. 3.5 crore usually, saw a steep fall in business. A TASMAC official in Coimbatore said, “Business at TASMAC Elite shops has also dropped slightly.” Officials said that over the last three days, the situation had stabilised and it was business as usual. Similar was the trend in Pollachi belt. In the neighbouring Nilgiris district, the tourist footfall dwindled post demonetisation which in turn has a cascading affect on liquor sales. Sales dropped by 25 per cent in the Salem region where TASMAC has 258 outlets. TASMAC sales in this pocket on an average stood at Rs 3.75 crore. On November 9, it tumbled to Rs 3.06 crore. Again, over the last two days, sales have picked up, and on November 15, it stood at Rs. 3.30 crore. Liquor sale in the state has been growing at 12-15 per cent, year on year. More than 70 lakh people, consume liquor at TASMAC outlets everyday. (With inputs from Sangeetha Kandavel from Chennai, C. Jaisankar from Tiruchi, Rohan Premkumar from Udhagamandalam, and S.P.

396,2016-11-17,10.0,"HC hopeful of quick end to currency crunch, unrest",": The Madras High Court observed that the volatile situation prevailing in the country would be solved once the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) started distributing currencies of Rs. 500 denomination. Justice N. Kirubakaran made the observation on a plea seeking a direction to the Registrar of Co-operative Societies to follow the procedures laid down by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) relating to demonetisation and permit withdrawal of cash and exchange of old currencies in these societies. “People are suffering; there is no doubt. Let us see how to improve the situation,” the judge added while querying the counsel for the RBI as to when would Rs. 500 denomination currencies be made available to the people in Tamil Nadu. To this, the counsel submitted that there are practical difficulties in transporting the currencies, in view of a recent seizure of Rs. 500 crore from a container near Coimbatore. “The RBI has stopped transporting currencies through private agencies. Now, it [transportation] is made only through government agencies,” he added. The counsel then assured to convey the court’s concern to the RBI officials, and submitted that he would inform the court about the tentative date when the currencies would reach the State. As to the plea to permit the District Central Cooperative Banks (DCCB) to exchange the demonetised currencies, the RBI’s counsel said, “The decision to ban DCCBs from exchanging notes was made apprehending malpractices.” Recording the submissions, the judge adjourned the plea to November 18 for further hearing.

397,2016-11-17,10.0,?Demonetisation will hurt food production?,"In dire straits:As most farmers have their accounts in primary agricultural co-operative credit societies, the recall of Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,000 notes has hurt them the most, the Tamil Nadu government has said.
 
| Photo Credit: M.S. Sriram : Reacting to the demonetisation-triggered crisis for the first time, the Tamil Nadu government on Wednesday said that disbursement of crop loans to farmers through primary agricultural co-operative credit societies has been affected and it would severely affect food production in the State. The government was “unable” to give new loans to farmers for samba cultivation which accounts for a major chunk of the State’s food production, an official release stated, adding that a meeting to discuss the situation was chaired by Cooperation Minister Sellur K. Raju in the Secretariat on Wednesday. Crop loans have been given only to the tune of Rs. 2,075 crore as of November 7 this year, as against the annual target of Rs. 6,000 crore, it said, adding the Reserve Bank of India’s (RBI) announcement “not only disturbed the efforts to meet the target in terms of crop loans disbursement but would also affect the food production in Tamil Nadu”. As most of the farmers in rural areas had accounts in primary agricultural co-operative credit societies, payment of loans and collection of dues were severely affected as Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,000 notes could not be deposited here unlike branches of the nationalised banks, the government noted. Though the State government ensured that fixed deposits in credit societies increased from Rs. 26,247 crore in 2011 to Rs. 54,914 crore this year, new deposits could not be made due to demonetisation. Supply of fertilisers and seeds in all the 4,474 primary agricultural co-operative credit societies has been affected and other services like issuance of birth and death certificates have been severely affected leading to loss of revenue. The banking services of 23 district central co-operative banks and their 813 branches, which cater to several lakh customers, were also severely affected. Farmers were also not able to repay their loans, it added.

398,2016-11-17,10.0,HC wants deadline relaxed for exchanging old currency notes in its custody,"The Madras High Court Bench here on Wednesday wanted the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) to come up with a circular exempting Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,000 currency notes in court custody, in connection with various criminal cases, from the deadline of March 31, 2017, fixed by the Centre for exchange of the demonetised notes. Taking up the issue as a suo motu public interest litigation, a Division Bench of Justices S. Nagamuthu and M.V. Muralidaran directed a Central Government Standing Counsel to get instructions from the RBI by Tuesday on issuing such a circular so that the currency notes in court custody could be exchanged as and when the criminal cases get disposed of. “What we would suggest is that your circular can state that the deadline fixed by you for exchange of demonetised currency notes would not be applicable to the currency in court custody and that those notes can be exchanged after the disposal of the criminal case concerned on production of a certificate from the court with serial numbers of the notes,” Mr. Justice Nagamuthu said. Pointing out that sample data obtained by the High Court from the lower courts in seven districts revealed that they were in custody of nearly Rs. 2 crore involved in various criminal cases, the judge said: “We are sure that at least Rs. 50 crore would be available with various lower courts throughout the State and that money includes the demonetised Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,000 notes. “The lower courts may not be in a position to return the money to the owners until the conclusion of trial and we do not know how many years would it take for the trial to get over. So, by the time the currency notes are handed over to the lawful owners, the notes should not have lost their value as a legal tender. Then, no purpose would be served in returning the money.” The judge said the currency notes in the custody of courts, included those that had been seized by the police from people accused of offences such as corruption, robbery, and so on. “In the case of robbery, the victim of the crime is legally entitled to return of his money. Such victim should not get punished because of demonetisation and delay in trial,” he added. Therefore, the court had taken up the issue as a suo motu petition in public interest.

The CMC had collected only Rs.78 lakh in the current year till November 8 when the decision of demonetisation was announced by Prime Minister Narendra Modi. “We recorded an increase in the revenue as we accepted the old currency notes,” said CMC president H.S. Anil Kumar. As the banks would be accepting the old notes till December 30, the CMC had continued with collecting the old notes. Kandaya Adalat Mr. Anil Kumar, at a press conference in Hassan on Tuesday, said the CMC would hold a Kandaya Adalat on November 22 and 23, to help the public settle their disputes related to taxes. “The council had invited suggestions from the public on improving the services.

Further, he said the CMC would make names of those who had not cleared the tax dues public soon.

402,2016-11-17,10.0,Demonetisation rocks Chhattisgarh Assembly,"The Central government’s move to scrap Rs. 500 and Rs. 1000 notes rocked the Chhattisgarh Assembly on the first day of its winter session on Tuesday, with the main Opposition party, the Congress, forcing five adjournments during the day. The Congress raised the issue of a suicide by a farmer in Raigarh district of the State, allegedly due to frustration caused by the demonetisation. Led by the State Congress president Bhupesh Baghel, the Congress MLAs demanded discussion under an adjournment motion on the “panicky situation.” “Sixteen people have died across the country and one farmer has committed suicide in Chhattisgarh because of this move. People are not able to use their own hard-earned money,” said Mr. Baghel on the day when the Raman Singh government planned to “congratulate” the Narendra Modi government on its move. Speaker Gourishankar Agrawal, however, refused permission to the Opposition after which the Congress MLAs resorted to sloganeering and forced five adjournments. Janata Congress MLA Amit Jogi, along with Congress MLAs Siyaram Kaushik and R.K. Rai, trooped to the well of the House in protest against the demonetisation. The three MLAs were suspended from the House for protesting in the well of the House. Earlier in the day, Mr. Amit Jogi came to the Assembly in a bullock cart to protest the “anti-poor” policies of the Raman Singh government. There were heated exchanges between the Opposition and the Treasury benches throughout the day and hardly any business could be transacted as the Congress did not even allow the question hour. The House was adjourned for the day after the government allowed the Opposition to participate in the discussion “to congratulate” the Central government on Wednesday on its demonetisation decision. “There cannot be any discussion in the Assembly on a decision taken by the Central government. We can only congratulate them,” the Chief Minister said outside the House.

403,2016-11-17,10.0,CPI(M) stages demonstration against demonetisation,"Thirty-eight cadres of Communist Party of India (Marxist), led by district secretary K.G. Bhaskaran, were courted arrest while attempting to stage an agitation in front of Tirunelveli railway junction on Wednesday without obtaining police permission. Besides, the party also staged demonstrations at Veeravanallur, Sambavar Vadakarai and other places across the district, condemning demonetisation by the Central government. The speakers said since it was implemented all of a sudden, common people were the worst-affected. D. Raja, town secretary, who led the agitation near Thoothukudi Head Post Office on Tiruchendur Road, said the demonetised notes of Rs.500 and Rs.1,000 should be accepted until fresh currency notes were available adequately in banks and ATMs. He said people had been waiting in long queues in front of ATMs which were not adequately loaded with cash. K.S. Arjunan, district secretary, was present. There were similar agitations at 14 places, including Kovilpatti, in Thoothukudi district. Dindigul The CPI(M) cadres staged a similar agitation in Dindigul on Wednesday. On the pretext of abolishing black money, the Union gGovernment, headed by Narendra Modi, banned circulation of the high-value notes, putting the people of the country to untold hardships. The life of ordinary people and salaried class had come to a grinding halt, they said. People were unable to withdraw their own money from banks. Bank officials claimed that there was no money in the chest. The protesters asked how could the Bharatiya Janata Party leaders term the hardships faced by the weaker sections of society “a sacrifice for nation building”. Speaking at the demonstration, former MLA Balabharathi, district secretary Pandi and others said if the BJP-led government was really interested in abolishing black money and bringing the guilty to book, what was the necessity to discontinue the currency notes. Income Tax officials should be entrusted with the task of conducting raids on those having huge amounts of unaccounted money. Instead of doing this, the Modi government had discontinued the currencies, jeopardising the life of the common man, she said, and urged the people to think of the evil designs of the Centre. She also came down heavily on the district police for not granting permission for the party functionaries to stage the demonstration and harassing them during the protest. The party cadres would come to the streets in protest against such actions of the police, she said.

According to Jayaprakash, executive officer of the temple, the revenue of the temple has reduced by over 35 per cent on an average. There has also been a 40 per cent decline in the number of devotees visiting the temple, Mr. Jayaprakash said. Mr. Jayaprakash told The Hindu that the average income of the temple is about Rs. 1.25 crore per month, which includes the sale of special entrance tickets, archana tickets and other religious rituals performed at the temple. “Devotees are producing Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,000 notes for different sevas. The temple authorities have no other option but to refuse the Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,000 notes. The temple authorities are asking the devotees to give small denomination notes as religious institutions are not permitted to accept the banned notes,” Mr. Jayaprakash said. As a result, people who can afford to buy tickets for special entrance or special pooja stand in long queues for the darshan and this has resulted in the temple losing a major chunk of its income, Mr. Jayaprakash said. Over 3,500 to 4,000 people normally visit the temple on Sundays, Mondays and other auspicious days and at least 2,000 people visit the temple on other days on an average, he said. “Even dakshine to the arathi thatte has come down drastically,” he said. He said that the temple authorities were not aware of people putting bags of the now banned Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,000 notes into the temple hundis. However, he said that he will soon appeal to the Deputy Commissioner of the district to open the hundis in the last week of November. Similarly, there has been a sharp decline in the income and the number of visitors to the Chamundeshwari temple here. Revenue of temple has reduced by over 35 p.c. and the number of devotees has declined by 40 p.c.

From November 9 to 13, the cash cow of Tamil Nadu on an average lost Rs. 15 crore per day. On November 14 and 15, the loss was pegged at Rs. 11 crore per day. TASMAC sells liquor worth Rs. 67-70 crore per day through its 6,195 outlets across the State. On weekends, the sales shoot up to Rs. 90 crore. During the festive season, particularly Deepavali, Christmas and New Year, sales touches Rs. 100 crore on a single day. A senior official in TASMAC, said, “Tipplers stayed away from TASMAC counters since the demonetisation announcement. We had given instructions to our managers and salesmen not to accept Rs. 500 or Rs. 1,000.” A senior union member said, “There was a lull for the first three days. People panicked about spending whatever cash they had with them,” he said, adding that on the fourth and fifth days people had Rs 2,000 notes, but there was no change at the counter to pay them back, and therefore they refused to take the notes. A total of 13 managers and supervisors with whom The Hindu spoke to in Chennai, unanimously said that demonetisation was the main reason for the dip in sales, but there was another reason for the revenue loss as well —short supply of liquor in the State. Beer and Indian Made Foreign Liquor from United Breweries, which holds 30 per cent market share in the liquor market have gone out of shelves. In the Tiruchi region, liquor sales dropped by about 35-40 per cent. At one outlet near Central Bus stand in Tiruchi, which sells liquor worth Rs 2.7 lakh per day, sales was only to the tune of Rs 1 lakh after the Centre’s announcement. On Wednesday, the same shop registered sales of Rs. 2.5 lakh, restoring trade, according to a source. Coimbatore, which sells liquor worth Rs. 3.5 crore usually, saw a steep fall in business. A TASMAC official in Coimbatore said, “Business at TASMAC Elite shops has also dropped slightly.” In the neighbouring Nilgiris district, the tourist footfall dwindled post demonetisation which in turn has a cascading affect on liquor sales. Sales dropped by 25 per cent in the Salem region where TASMAC has 258 outlets. TASMAC sales in this pocket on an average stood at Rs 3.75 crore. On November 9, it tumbled to Rs 3.06 crore. Again, over the last two days, sales have picked up, and on November 15, it stood at Rs. 3.30 crore. (With inputs from Sangeetha Kandavel from Chennai, C.

Sudheeran on Wednesday said that his party would stage a Raj Bhavan march at 3 p.m. on November 21 to protest against the ‘indifference’ of the Union government to the problems faced by the people as a result of demonetising high value currency notes. In a chat with the media here, Mr. Sudheeran said the common man continued to reel under the impact of demonetisation even eight days after its implementation. The District Congress Committees will organise similar agitations in a key area under their respective jurisdiction.

Taking part in a seminar on demonetisation organised by the A.P. Editors Association here on Wednesday, they wanted the Centre to take more logical steps to eliminate counterfeit notes and weed out black money. Initiating the discussion, A.P. Editors Association State president Krishnam Raju Vaadapalli said the government should order an independent probe to ascertain who had benefited by the spike in deposits of some banks in July-September quarter. They suggested, among other things, enactment of a piece of legislation to confiscate ill-gotten wealth stashed in foreign banks, unearthing of benami land holdings and raids on safe deposit lockers of high networth individuals to unearth unaccounted wealth and drastic reduction in income tax rates to reduce generation of black money. ‘Increase IT limit’ Given the quantum jump in the cost of living, annual income below Rs. 10 lakh should not be taxed. More and more people would voluntarily come forward to pay income tax if the rate was only 10 per cent on income from Rs. 10 lakh to Rs. 20 lakh, 20 per cent on income from Rs. 20 lakh to Rs. 30 lakh. Income above Rs. 30 lakh could be taxed at 30 per cent, they suggested. Forum for Good Governance president T. Gopal Reddy, Prakasam District Development Forum president Ch.Ranga Rao, Acharya N.G.

Within a week after the demonetisation came into effect, the CMC received as much as Rs.72 lakh in the form of property tax and other payments due to the council. The CMC had collected only Rs.78 lakh till November 8 when the decision of demonetisation was announced by Prime Minister Narendra Modi. “We recorded an increase in the revenue as we accepted the old currency notes,” said CMC president H.S. Anil Kumar. As the banks would be accepting the old notes till December 30, the CMC had continued with collecting the old notes. Kandaya Adalat Mr. Anil Kumar, at a press conference in Hassan on Tuesday, said the CMC would hold a Kandaya Adalat on November 22 and 23, to help the public settle their disputes related to taxes. “The council had invited suggestions from the public on improving the services.

  Communist Party of India (Marxist) cadres staged a demonstration here on Wednesday in protest against demonetisation of Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,000 currency notes. On the pretext of abolishing black money, the Union Government, headed by Narendra Modi, banned circulation of the high-value notes, putting the people of the country to untold hardships. The life of ordinary people and salaried class had come to a grinding halt, they said. People were unable to withdraw their own money from banks. Bank officials claimed that there was no money in the chest. The protesters asked how could the Bharatiya Janata Party leaders term the hardships faced by the weaker sections of society “a sacrifice for nation building”. Speaking at the demonstration, former MLA Balabharathi, district secretary Pandi and others said if the BJP-led government was really interested in abolishing black money and bringing the guilty to book, what was the necessity to discontinue the currency notes. Income Tax officials should be entrusted with the task of conducting raids on those having huge amounts of unaccounted money. Instead of doing this, the Modi government had discontinued the currencies, jeopardising the life of the common man, she said, and urged the people to think of the evil designs of the Centre. She also came down heavily on the district police for not granting permission for the party functionaries to stage the demonstration and harassing them during the protest. The party cadres would come to the streets in protest against such actions of the police, she said.

  The Congress activists organised a novel protest against demonetisation at the local Bhavani Nagar Circle, by rallying around with pushcarts and distributing goods for free among the public. The demonstration, led by DCC president Venugopal Reddy here on Wednesday, sought to highlight the inconvenience caused to the general public, particularly the vendors, small traders and other members of the working class, who are unable to exchange high denomination notes for buying regular livelihood items and continuing their normal trade. “Their [small traders/vendors] business have been dull since the announcement, with not many customers purchasing the products owing to the high value notes and lack of subsequent currency for exchange. How can the government justify their act if the working class, who depend on their daily business, are the worst affected?” he questioned. Terming the current demonetisation as a ‘move which was not well thought out’ [by the Central government], the activists alleged Prime Minster Narendra Modi has been supporting industrialists like Ambanis, Adani etc., at the cost of the common man. They later unveiled a flex banner highlighting the same message pictorially with a tagline - ‘Nalla Kuberulaki Pattam Kattina PM’. ‘Increase availability of Rs. 100 notes’ Meanwhile, members of the All India Trade Union Congress (AITUC) staged a protest at the premises of the State Bank of Hyderabad (SBH) near the Municipal Office Circle. Highlighting the issues faced by daily wage workers, AITUC general secretary Murali said the workers had not received wages for the past few days and expressed their inability to buy essential commodities. They further demanded that the government increase the availability of Rs. 100 notes, round-the-clock ATMs and extension of the date for depositing money in bank till December 31.

413,2016-11-17,10.0,TN sees demonetisation shadow over food output,"Reacting to the demonetisation-triggered crisis for the first time, the Tamil Nadu government on Wednesday said that disbursement of crop loans to farmers through primary agricultural co-operative credit societies has been affected and it would severely affect food production in the State. The government was “unable” to give new loans to farmers for samba cultivation which accounts for a major chunk of the State’s food production, an official release stated, adding that a meeting to discuss the situation was chaired by Cooperation Minister Sellur K. Raju in the Secretariat on Wednesday. Crop loans have been given only to the tune of Rs. 2,075 crore as of November 7 this year, as against the annual target of Rs. 6,000 crore, it said, adding the Reserve Bank of India’s (RBI) announcement “not only disturbed the efforts to meet the target in terms of crop loans disbursement but would also affect the food production in Tamil Nadu”. As most of the farmers in rural areas had accounts in primary agricultural co-operative credit societies, payment of loans and collection of dues were severely affected as Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,000 notes could not be deposited here unlike branches of the nationalised banks, the government noted. Though the State government ensured that fixed deposits in credit societies increased from Rs. 26,247 crore in 2011 to Rs. 54,914 crore this year, new deposits could not be made due to demonetisation. Supply of fertilisers and seeds in all the 4,474 primary agricultural co-operative credit societies has been affected and other services like issuance of birth and death certificates have been severely affected leading to loss of revenue. The banking services of 23 district central co-operative banks and their 813 branches, which cater to several lakh customers, were also severely affected. Farmers were also not able to repay their loans, it added.

415,2016-11-17,10.0,Labour-intensive industries feel pinch of demonetisation,"Labour-intensive industries in Thoothukudi district have been affected by demonetisation of high-value currency notes, as they are not able to pay wages to their workers. The traditional safety match industry, though largely mechanised, relied on labourers, J. Devadoss, secretary, South India Match Manufacturers’ Association, Kovilpatti told The Hindu on Wednesday. Around one lakh workers had been relying on this industry. Wages would normally be paid once a week based on productivity. The cash withdrawal allowed after demonetisation was inadequate to pay wages to labourers. The cash withdrawal had been limited to Rs. 24,000 for a week for savings account holders and Rs.50,000 for current account holders. The ceiling should be increased to facilitate payment of salaries to employees. Presently, the labourers had been managing their day-to-day expenses with Deepavali bonus and last month’s salary, Mr. Devadoss said. Moreover, traders from North India were reluctant to place orders for match boxes as they were used to cash transactions. Movement of finished goods to Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Madhya Pradesh and Odisha had come to a halt in the last one week, he said. Salt industry had also been facing a setback as stocks of manufactured salt could not be transported. According to A.R.A.S. Dhanabalan, secretary, Thoothukudi Small-Scale Salt Manufacturers’ Association, salt production was stopped with the onset of monsoon in October-end. Normally, there would a demand for salt during rainy season, but not this year, he said. Despite achieving high production this year, the product could not be marketed because of demonetisation. M.S.P. Thenraj, president, Thoothukudi Salt Traders’ Association, said there was a slowdown in the trade as employers could not pay wages to labourers engaged in packing and loading. Since lorry drivers and attendants could not be paid, only 20-30 per cent trucks were being operated, that too on short routes, S. Varadharajan, secretary, Tuticorin District Container Truck Owners’ Association, said. Though truck operators had been exempted from paying toll until November 18 and demonetised notes were valid till November 24, the lorry crew needed money to buy food. Getting change dificult The Rs. 2,000 notes could not be given to them as they would find it difficult to get change. Had the authorities released new Rs. 500 notes earlier, this crisis could have been better managed, he said. Many ice plant owners were also feeling the pinch as suspension of mechanised boat fishing operations had forced them to stop production. “Labourers are managing their day-to-day expenses with Deepavali bonus and last month’s salary” Printable version | Jan 7, 2017 1:22:00 AM | http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/Labour-intensive-industries-feel-pinch-of-demonetisation/article16644387.ece © The Hindu A few days after Ms. Jayalalithaa’s death, wall posters began to appear all over Chennai and in parts of Tamil Nadu projecting Sasikala as the next-in-line leader in the AIADMK V.K.

416,2016-11-17,10.0,Relax deadline for exchange of currency in custody: HC,"The Madras High Court Bench here on Wednesday wanted the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) to come up with a circular exempting Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,000 currency notes in court custody, in connection with various criminal cases, from the deadline of March 31, 2017, fixed by the Centre for exchange of the demonetised notes. Taking up the issue as a suo motu public interest litigation, a Division Bench of Justices S. Nagamuthu and M.V. Muralidaran directed a Central Government Standing Counsel to get instructions from the RBI by Tuesday on issuing such a circular so that the currency notes in court custody could be exchanged as and when the criminal cases get disposed of. “What we would suggest is that your circular can state that the deadline fixed by you for exchange of demonetised currency notes would not be applicable to the currency in court custody and that those notes can be exchanged after the disposal of the criminal case concerned on production of a certificate from the court with serial numbers of the notes,” Mr. Justice Nagamuthu said. Pointing out that sample data obtained by the High Court from the lower courts in seven districts revealed that they are in custody of nearly Rs. 2 crore involved in various criminal cases, the judge said: “We are sure that at least Rs. 50 crore would be available with various lower courts throughout the State and that money includes the demonetised Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,000 notes. “The lower courts may not be in a position to return the money to the owners until the conclusion of trial and we do not know how many years would it take for the trial to get over. So, by the time the currency notes are handed over to the lawful owners, the notes should not have lost their value as a legal tender. Then, no purpose would be served in returning the money.” ‘Data reveals lower courts are in custody of nearly Rs. 2 crore involved in criminal cases’ Printable version | Jan 7, 2017 1:22:02 AM | http://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/Relax-deadline-for-exchange-of-currency-in-custody-HC/article16644395.ece © The Hindu Notwithstanding the frequent harassment on charges of trespass into Sri Lankan waters, Tamil Nadu fishermen struggle to get permission to visit the annual festival at St. Anthony’ Church in Katchatheevu."

  “I did not know that old Rs. 500 notes are not valid anymore until this morning,” said Gowribai (70), who works in a poultry farm at Shantigrama, near Hassan on Wednesday. Her employer had paid her her weekly wages in the old currency, leaving her to deal with the burden of exchanging the money. She only found out that the notes were invalid when she went to a shop to buy biscuits for her grandchildren. When this reporter visited the village on Wednesday morning, the old woman was moving from one shop to another asking for change. Finally, she went back to her employer and managed to exchange the notes. “I get Rs. 150 per day and my employer pays us wages once a week. I had to attend a programme at my daughter’s place. When I reached the bus-stand, I was told that nobody would accept Rs. 500 notes. I requested many shops here, but none obliged,” she said. Ms. Gowribai said she had no bank account and is finding it difficult to understand the procedure of exchanging the old notes. No money in banks Like her, many others from rural areas have had to contend with similar worries. Farmers, who got paid after selling their crop, are forced to deposit money in banks and withdraw it later. All these years, they used to keep their cash at home and clear loans or spend the stored money when required. “I had only Rs. 3,000 in the old currency. I deposited the amount in my account and have not been able to withdraw it so far as there is no cash in the bank,” said Dyave Gowda, a farmer and agricultural labourer at Boovanahalli near Hassan. He owns three acres of land and this time, he hardly got three quintals of maize. Savings Hundreds of people are lining up in front of banks and ATMs, taking time out of their work schedules, to either exchange or withdraw cash, across the district. Hanume Gowda, in his early 70s, was in a queue in front of the branch of State Bank of Mysore in Shantigrama to deposit Rs. 30,000 in his account. “My wife had saved Rs. 30,000 over the years. She had not told me about this. After she learnt that the old currency has been withdrawn, she gave me the money to deposit. Now I am standing in the queue to link my Aadhaar number to the bank account. Later, I can deposit the cash,” Hanume Gowda said. Nanjamma, his wife, said, “I don’t have any money left with me for our daily expenses. We have to stand in a queue to withdraw a few Rs. 100 notes,” she said.

Justice N. Kirubakaran made the observation on a plea seeking a direction to the Registrar of Co-operative Societies to follow the procedures laid down by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) relating to demonetisation and permit withdrawal of cash and exchange of old currencies in these societies. “People are suffering; there is no doubt. Let us see how to improve the situation,” the judge added while querying the counsel for the RBI as to when would Rs. 500 denomination currencies be made available to the people in Tamil Nadu. To this, the counsel submitted that there are practical difficulties in transporting the currencies, in view of a recent seizure of Rs. 500 crore from a container near Coimbatore. “The RBI has stopped transporting currencies through private agencies. Now, it [transportation] is made only through government agencies,” he added. The counsel then assured to convey the court’s concern to the RBI officials, and submitted that he would inform the court about the tentative date when the currencies would reach the State. As to the plea to permit the District Central Cooperative Banks (DCCB) to exchange the demonetised currencies, the RBI’s counsel said, “The decision to ban DCCBs from exchanging notes was made apprehending malpractices.” Recording the submissions, the judge adjourned the plea to November 18 for further hearing.

420,2016-11-18,11.0,Plan to airlift currency notes to remote areas,"The Maharashtra government along with the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has put in place a contingency plan to ferry currency notes to remote areas through a helicopter. At a meeting between RBI officials and the State government, it was decided to shortlist remote regions for the plan, including Gadchiroli, Chandrapur, Gondia and Bhandara, senior officials who attended the meeting told The Hindu. The plan will be put in place in case credit cooperative societies and district central cooperative banks run out of cash in remote and rural regions. Other commercial banks which can reach out to the remote areas do not have many branches. District banks not having enough cash could hit the currency availability. “The plan was discussed between Finance Minister Sudhir Mungantiwar, who is heading a Cabinet sub-committee on demonetisation, and RBI officials this week. We are likely to put the plan in place only in an extreme situation,” said a senior official of the Finance department.

421,2016-11-18,11.0,District banks prone to fake currency: RBI,"Mumbai: The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has conveyed to the State government that 3,800 branches of the District Central Cooperative Banks (DCCBs) cannot be allowed to exchange demonetised currency because they are prone to hawala transactions and fake currency. The RBI pointed out to a State government delegation this week that several suspicious transactions in DCCBs in Uttar Pradesh have been reported as well, while banks continue to work in the absence of any checking mechanisms to monitor fake currency. Under these circumstances, no chances can be taken in Maharashtra, the RBI said. Finance Minister Sudhir Mungantiwar confirmed to The Hindu that there remains a question mark on the monitoring mechanisms in DCCBs and the same has been conveyed by the RBI. The RBI has denied DCCBs to exchange old currency at a time when only 70 per cent of them are relying on the Real-time Gross Settlement System (RTGS) to transfer funds, and have little or no mechanisms, he said. “There are no means to check fake currency in these banks; earlier, there was a major fake currency racket busted in Mumbai as well. Under these circumstances, the RBI has conveyed fear over weak monitoring systems in DCCBs,” Mr. Mungantiwar said. The DCCBs in Maharashtra have already moved court against the decision by the government and RBI to keep them under restrictions following The Centre’s demonitisation initiative. Maharashtra has 31 DCCBs with 3,800 branches, mostly located in rural and remote areas. There are another 21,000 Cooperative Credit Societies catering to the rural population. “A large part of the rural population is having accounts with these institutions and not in commercial banks. Moreover, the commercial banks don’t have branches to exchange the specified bank notes in rural areas. This is leading to hardship for account-holders in rural areas,” Mr. Mungantiwar said. The RBI has also warned the State government that if fake currency finds its way into the DCCB network, it will create a financial mess for the government. “Not all of these banks are giving RTGS facility. They have no machines to check fake currency. Keeping all this in mind, we have agreed to the RBI’s argument,” he said.

422,2016-11-18,11.0,The warp and woof of demonetisation,"The yarn bobbins mounted on the creel of the circular interlock machine move seamlessly. A series of bulky movements later, the off-white yarn churns out some more off-white cloth, stretched from under the cylinder of the knitting machine. Venkatachalam, in his mid-50s, stands watching his machines, with his hands crossed behind his back, in his unit in Samundipuram in Tiruppur. The air is thick under the slow grumble of the machines and the steady suspension of off-white dust of the yarn, accentuated by the yellow light bulbs lighting up from underneath each running machine, casting long shifting shadows. Bales of yarn waiting to be fed into the machine and bales of cloth knitted from the yarn ready for the supplier are stacked on the side of the shop floor. This is what remains of the Diwali stock, he says. Venkatachalam had reached the knitting unit at 6 a.m. to run the machines. “My first worker will come in at 8.15 a.m,” he says. Until last week, this unit of 16 machines ran with two workers on round-the-clock shift. They were paid Rs.3,000 each every Saturday. This Monday, a week after Prime Minister Narendra Modi declared the existing Rs.500 and Rs.1,000 notes invalid, Venkatachalam had cut down two shifts to one. This has meant only alternate days of work for each of the two labourers. “Now, I’ll pay Rs.1,500 each to the two workers this week. No fresh yarn has come, and even if it did, I can’t run the machines without cash,” he says. Last week he produced 600 kilogram of cloth, against the usual 1,500 kilogram per week. He receives cheques from the supplier. But his wages are in cash. Some 18 kilometres away in Pandian Nagar, Shakthivel is picking up the last of the cloth bundles he had commissioned Karal Marx for cutting. Marx owns a rib-cutter that cuts fabrics into bundles of ribbons that are then stitched up as folding on collars and sleeves of T-shirts. His rib-cutter occupies a 50-sq.-feet space partitioned off his less-than-modest living quarters. The last of the bundles remaining from the Diwali stock supplied by people like Shakthivel are the ones left for work for Marx. At the foot of the rib-cutter is a can full of petrol. “Oh that. I had to fill petrol for my moped. But they refused change and I was forced to buy petrol for the entire money,” says Marx. Shakthivel runs a stitching section with seven labourers including his wife. The supplier provides him with cut cloth, and the cloth runs through five machines to emerge as a fancy top. “Just my type” declares a fair-skinned girl gazing out of a fuchsia printed top, on the bundle just finished. Only two days ago, Shakthivel had asked three of his workers not to come. “I only have old cash. And no fresh orders had come, and there were serpentine queues in the bank.” He has to pay Rs.4,000 each to each of them. He plans to wind up the remaining work, and lock up the section for the rest of the week. The rent of Rs.6,000 for the stitching section and house rent of Rs.5,000, both due for the 10th, was not accepted with old cash. Bending down to gently pick up her two-year-old son asleep on a cut cloth on the floor, Shakthivel’s wife Swarnalatha asks him if they should go to Palani, to be with their relatives. Abu Baquar Siddique, Shakthivel’s chief tailor, is a man of quiet pride. He collects part of his weekly wages daily, the Rs.200 from Shakthivel every evening goes into buying 2 kilograms of rice for Rs.100 and other groceries for a fresh-cooked dinner for his family of four. On Wednesday, Shakthivel gave him Rs.500 of the old note to tide over. When the past week saw households running on credit, goodwill, trust and goodness of the local grocers, Siddique never kept an ‘account’ of credit with any grocer. “I never have before. That’ll push us to buy more, consume more.” So, when the outlet refused to accept his money, he simply migrated to PDS rice. But his two young boys are unable to eat the poor quality ration rice. These men (and women) are part of the garment supply chain that swells at the lowest end to include many interdependent household units. This chain train hinged on work orders from the small supplier, to a micro unit, to the last-mile household unit — until demonetisation stopped it in its tracks. Slowly, units are beginning to grind to a halt, threatening to snap this chain. Two domestic suppliers that supplied cloth to Shakthivel’s stitching section locked down this Monday. The same two suppliers had supplied cloth to 20 other units with workforce of 20 each. Between them, the two suppliers each had a workforce of 100-150 workers. “They have to pay me around Rs.20,000-Rs.30,000,” says Shakthivel. Small suppliers and dependent tiny units that look to the supplier for work are wary of piling up work commitments and resultant unpaid wages. On Wednesday, the South Indian Collar Shirt and Small Manufacturers Association (SISMA) passed a resolution to downscale from 15 shifts per worker per week to six shifts. “Units are already laying off non-salaried workers,” says K.S. Babuji, general secretary, SISMA. Eashwaramoorthy is a domestic supplier selling to buyers in Mumbai and Delhi. His unit with a 20-man workforce has now pared down to just three workers. The rest were asked not to come. “The current account withdrawal limit of Rs.50,000 is not allowed by banks here. How do we pay,” he asks. Demonetisation for the garment industry came at a time when the buyers were on the verge of settling payments of the suppliers for the Diwali despatches across the country. The buyers are now unable to make bank transfers to the suppliers beyond Rs.49,000, and that too only after the suppliers courier multiple copies of proof for bank verification. The garment industry in Tiruppur is made of three types of units: exporters, merchant exporters who receive subcontract work from exporters, and domestic suppliers. Exports — a Rs.22,000-crore turnover business — are primarily cashless. Yet demonetisation has tangentially affected exporters because they have to engage peripherally with cash-based subcontracts for ‘job works’ such as knitting, buttoning, small servicing, printing, packing to merchant exporters. The merchant exporters themselves are small units with a workforce paid in cash. The cash crunch has halted 25 per cent of subcontracts commissioned by exporters, says T.R. Vijaya Kumar, general secretary, Tirupur Exporters’ Association (TEA), that has over 1,000 members. The exporters will have to deal with penalty of 20 per cent additional costs on shipments that will now be airlifted. It’s domestic suppliers who are facing the demonetisation heat the most. They include micro units and sections that are partly, largely or fully run on cash. The garment industry in Tiruppur has 8 lakh employees; 4 lakh in direct employment and another 4 lakh in subsidiary units such as knitting, dyeing, printing, embroidering, spinning, accessories. Of this, 20 per cent or 1.6 lakh workers are estimated to be unorganised workforce. There are 2,000 small, medium and tiny units — now facing the prospect of phased lockout — that provide work to this unorganised workforce. Early this year, the TEA had met the Prime Minister during his visit to Coimbatore to present a ‘Vision 2020’ document to him that envisages increasing the garment industry’s turnover to Rs.1 lakh crore by 2020. When demonetisation was announced, the exporters had cheered the decision. The TEA estimates the turnover of domestic units at Rs.7,000 crore from accounted transactions and another Rs.7,000 crore from cash transactions. On the other hand, the unorganised units solely run on cash are estimated to have a turnover of Rs.15,000 crore. For the exporters, this is a ‘parallel economy’ with a cumulative Rs.22,000-crore turnover. “This supply chain runs on cash, weeding out taxes. If this economy is integrated, then there will be a level playing field for all,” says Vijaya Kumar. Jeganathan bears a distant look as he scans through a Tamil paper. He was making daily sales worth Rs.10,000-Rs.30,000 on average out of his 80-sq.-feet shop, stacked with bundles of trackpants, T-shirts of all hues. On Monday, he sent away the only daily wager he had. “Yesterday, I downed the shutter by 4 p.m.,” he says. Not a single sale on Wednesday in the shop he co-owns with his brother. Khaderpettai market represents that parallel economy that Vijaya Kumar was talking about. It has over 3,000 shops, wholesale and retail and godowns, run solely on cash transactions. Khaderpettai lends the retail-end support for the domestic garment suppliers. They lend the rationale for business for the smaller manufacturing units, whose manufacturing orders hinge largely on the business vibrancy of Khaderpettai. Some of the garment godowns are straight extensions of the manufacturing units. The hustle of Khaderpettai is missing since the demonetisation. Many believe things would look up once money circulation picked up. The garment industry has a high labour demand. Attrition rate is 50 per cent, and the average labour shortage is 35 per cent. There is a general resistance both among labourers and domestic units to crediting wages through banks. Wage account entails Employees’ State Insurance and Provident Fund contribution from both ends. Labourers, with marginal wages, are not enthused at the prospect of deduction, and employers are equally unwilling to contribute. Demonetisation has struck at the heart of this cash mode of payment of wages. Hence, ever since demonetisation, a primarily contractual workforce is migrating from smaller domestic units to export units, which credit salary through wage accounts. But the ability of smaller export units to absorb this preliminary flight of labour will unfold only in the coming days. Also, export units may not fully be insulated as the chain involves cash-based merchant exporters too. Exporters also view demonetisation as a prelude to the nationwide rollout of the Goods and Services Tax (GST), as a move to bring everything into accounting, force small units to migrate to wage accounts. “Once GST comes into operation in April, there will less opposition and easy integration,” predicts Vijaya Kumar. But on the ground, there is another reality being played out. The experience of micro units and sections so far indicate a possible immiserisation of owners and workers. While labourers just may have the option of flitting to an export unit wherever possible, marginal units such as Shaktivel’s stitching section or the yarn-knitting unit of Venkatachalam don’t have that option. At worst, they will have to close down and move into the labour market themselves. Forty years ago, Vijaya Kumar’s father had started out with 10 workers and 10 machines. Today, he runs an export business with 1,500 workers. “If this had come then, my father would not have survived,” he agrees. This churn will decimate small units, which are unable to migrate, have no means or know-how to systemise their business operations. This slowly would also mean that businesses can henceforth be run only by the educated, who can engage tax accountants, auditors, and dedicated personnel for documentation. “Today’s tiny units are tomorrow’s larger units. This will also mean nipping start-ups in the bud,” concedes Vijaya Kumar. Pointing at three shuttered shops in a Khaderpettai lane, a man, who refuses to disclose his name, says that almost all shops have sent away their daily wage workers. Until last week, each shop had a Hindi-speaking worker to help negotiate with buyers from beyond the Vindhyas. “Do you see knitwear in the street shops of Chennai, Mumbai, and Delhi? They are from here. The garment units are showroom; we, Khaderpettai, are for the pavement. The poor buy from us,” he says. “We all started off lifting loads on our back and have come to own businesses. We are not educated.” Printable version | Jan 7, 2017 1:22:33 AM | http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/The-warp-and-woof-of-demonetisation/article16645634.ece © The Hindu A few days after Ms. Jayalalithaa’s death, wall posters began to appear all over Chennai and in parts of Tamil Nadu projecting Sasikala as the next-in-line leader in the AIADMK V.K.

423,2016-11-18,11.0,Currency shortage continues,"While shortage of small change continued for the tenth day of demonetisation, crowds at banks started wearing thin for exchange of banned currency, more so because the limit was reduced to Rs.2,000 and a new trend of panic-stricken people repaying loans in haste emerged. “It doesn’t appear to be a good trend from the banks’ point of view, as it is going to adversely affect our loans portfolio. There’s no need to close your ‘performing’ loans in a jiffy,” a senior official with the State Bank of India (SBI) said on condition of anonymity. The SBI and its associates have about a hundred of their ATMs continuously loaded in and around the city with Rs.2,000 and Rs.100 currency notes. The branches, too, stacked small change brought from the treasury in Thriuvananthapuram. ATMs and branches in suburban Kochi continued to reel under pressure for want of adequate cash. The overall availability of currency, however, remained more or less the same as the past week but bank officials are hopeful that the arrival of fresh tranche of Rs.500 notes presumably on Monday would better the situation. A leading private bank frisked its employees and checked their baggage to ensure that they did not go out of their way to ‘help’ customers. People who could not find small change for their Rs.2,000 notes conducted transactions using ‘I owe you’ slips or bartering goods. Fuel stations, which the government said could be used to swipe cards to get currency of Rs.2,000, largely refused to do the same. “They refused to accept the Rs.2,000 note even if you bought petrol for Rs.500 unless you would take the balance in banned currency,” rued Sreejith, a motorist.

424,2016-11-18,11.0,Demonetisation will not hit informal economy: BJP,"VISAKHAPATNAM: Informal economy will not be crippled by demonetisation, and real productive economy in agriculture, tiny and micro enterprises will improve, BJP national general secretary P. Muralidhar Rao has said. On the other hand, the highly extortionist practices of daily finance would be hit to some extent, he told reporters here on Friday. Describing demonetisation as the beginning of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s war against black economy, fulfilling the 2014 election mandate, he said it would bring down inflation very soon and curb speculation in gold and land. Consequently, their rates would come down, bringing them within the reach of the common people. Describing demonetisation as a historic step and not a decision in isolation, he said it would bring about fundamental changes in political and economic system, including simultaneous elections and State-funding of elections. The war also could later be taken to black money in the form of gold and land. The war against black money would ultimately benefit the people and that was the reason why the Prime Minister appealed to the people to bear with the inconvenience for 50 days. He addressed the nation because he knew about the problems that would arise from demonetisation of 86 per cent of the currency in circulation. He said that the Rs.2,000 note was not a substitute for Rs.1,000 and Rs.500 notes, and RBI had not indicated the volume of Rs.2,000 notes it would print. The demand for higher denomination notes could not be estimated and the government was seized of the matter. Demonetisation would result in considerably higher revenues for State and Central governments, enabling them take up construction of schools, hospitals, etc., Mr. Rao said. Mr. Modi had taken up the issue of bringing back black money stashed abroad, and because of limitations in international laws it could not be achieved, he said. The government, however, would not compromise on black money abroad. A SIT was constituted at the first Cabinet meeting. The mandate against black money was not divided, Mr. Rao said. BJP Floor leader in the Assembly P. Vishnu Kumar Raju, city president M. Nagendra and leaders Ch. Ramakotaiah and P.V.N. Madhav were present.

426,2016-11-18,11.0,"Despite currency crisis, funds flow into Snehasparsam account","Kozhikode: Funds have started flowing into the account of ‘Snehasparsam’, a project of Kidney Patients Welfare Society of the Kozhikode district panchayat, despite a severe scarcity of lower denomination currency notes. The fund-raising for the programme held on November 13 did not yield the expected result, and hence the deadline for making contributions was extended to November 20. This gave organisations and panchayats enough time to raise funds internally and deposit them in the Snehasparsam account. So far, Rs.3.8 crore has been deposited in the account on behalf of various grama panchayats and block panchayats. The fund-raising on November 13 fell flat as most people in rural areas did not have enough cash in their possession, and those who had it were reluctant to part with the meagre change they had. “We had organised elaborate campaigns as in the previous year, and many people had promised to contribute to the initiative. But on November 13, we found that those who had planned to donate Rs.200 brought it down to Rs.100. Some could not contribute as we did not have enough change for the Rs.500 and Rs.1,000 notes with them,” said Snehasparsam project coordinator Sreeraj N. The fund raised for Snehasparsam through various means is used to aid kidney patients in the district, besides those suffering from psychological disorders and HIV patients. “The surge in contributions over the last couple of days shows that the good-hearted people of Kozhikode have no qualms about helping those in need, even when they are in dire straits,” Mr. Sreeraj said. The second phase of the fund-raising initiative will be taken up in urban areas including Kozhikode Corporation, Vadakara, Ramanattukara, and Feroke municipalities and Kadalundy grama panchayat. “We expect the current financial crisis to be alleviated by then. Also, people in urban areas are more used to net banking,” he added.

427,2016-11-18,11.0,KCR to meet Modi on demonetisation,"Telangana Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao, whose State is in dire straits following the demonetisation of Rs. 500 and Rs. 1000 notes, is scheduled to meet Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Saturday to discuss steps to mitigate the plight of people. In a statement here, B. Vinod Kumar, Lok Sabha Deputy Floor Leader of the Telugu Rashtra Samiti, said that on Thursday Mr. Rao had a telephonic conversation with Mr. Modi. A statement issued by the Chief Minister’s Office quoted Mr. Rao as saying that while he welcomed demonetisation ‘if it helped clean up the country’s economy’, the Centre should take into account the loss incurred by State governments and decreased flow of revenue to them. Telangana wants the Centre to defer payments by States on the loans borrowed by them as they are hard-pressed for payments of advances and salaries to employees. However, Mr. Rao’s counterpart in Andhra Pradesh, N. Chandrababu Naidu, had been a vocal supporter of the Modi government’s decision. Mr. Rao had said that all those having more than Rs. 2.5 lakh as income or savings should not be treated as black money holders. “It should be referred as unaccounted money. Small and medium traders, businessmen and those in the unorganised sector should be given exemptions. They should be given one more chance to disclose their income and deposit the money in banks, granting them one-time amnesty.” Mr. Rao said any reform was a continuous process and aimed at achieving excellence. However, the Centre’s decision to curb black money should not cause misery and suffering to common public. People should be made partners and stakeholders in development.

428,2016-11-18,11.0,ICAI members hail demonetisation,": The chartered accountants praised Prime Minister Narendra Modi for announcing demonetisation of high denomination currency notes to keep a check on unaccounted money. At an awareness programme organised by the Bharatiya Janata Party, here on Friday, Institute of Chartered Accounts of India (ICAI) Karimnagar chapter chairman D. Niranjana Chary hailed the bold decision of the Union Government. He said the demonetisation would check terrorism and hoarding of unaccounted money. Allaying fears among the people, he said that they would not face any problem in banking transactions with their legal money. He said that presenting the PAN card number was mandatory in the banking system if a customer withdraws more than Rs. 50,000. The institute office-bearers K. Venkateshwarlu, G. Anand Kumar, N. Varaprasad, Y. Anil Kumar, K. Rammohan, BJP official spokesperson Bandi Sanjay Kumar and others participated in the programme. They said that the demonetisation would help reduce prices in the real-estate sector and there would be no registrations of properties under fictitious names. It would also have an impact on the fee of management-quota seats in professional colleges. They also said that people would be habituated to do more banking transactions and there would be more deposits in the banks helping the bankers in providing more loans at lower interest rates. They also clarified that the CAs would only tell the people on how to manage taxes and help the Government get its revenue.

429,2016-11-18,11.0,Currency crisis forcesNRIs to cancel vacation,"Many Malayali expatriates working in the Gulf have either cancelled or postponed their annual vacation with the family back home in view of the ongoing currency crisis set off by the demonetisation of Rs.1,000 and Rs. 500 currency notes. Some of the NRI Malayalis told The Hindu that they did not want to waste their leave by joining their family in a cash-strapped unhappy situation. They have apparently been apprehensive of the remaining days of the current year. “I’m forced to postpone my journey to next year because of the existing situation in Kerala. My parents are already suffering there because of the Central government making high-value currencies invalid. And I don’t want to add to their woes by being with them in this crunch time,” said P.K. Mubashir, a company secretary in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. He was to join his family here in less than a week. Mohammed Ashraf V., a supermarket staff in Dubai and hailing from Ponnani, too said he had cancelled his flight ticket because of the crisis. “I’m not the only one. Many friends I know have put off their travel plans. We have been leading a fairly good lifestyle here. It will be hard for us to spend time at home without enough cash in hand. So it’s better not to go home now,” he said. According to travel agents here and in Kozhikode, cancellation of tickets has increased in the wake of the demonetisation. “People are afraid and uncertain about the situation. None can predict tomorrow,” said Mohammed Saleem, a travel agent. Some Kuwaiti expats compared the situation to that caused by Saddam Hussein by invading Kuwait in 1990. A mass evacuation of Indians from Kuwait ahead of the Gulf War had led to a tough situation for a large number of Keralites. Many had suffered when the Kuwait Dinar had lost its value. C.T. Mohammed Haneefa, an expat in Kuwait currently on vacation at Koduvally, said he was happy as his return date was nearing. “With the currency crisis, all donations have stopped. No charity organisation approaches us these days. Everyone can understand the situation,” he said.

430,2016-11-18,11.0,Demonetisation hits rural farmers hard,"Kozhikode: In an attempt to overcome demonetisation challenges, rural merchants in the district are still depending on old currency notes as a last resort to pay farmers who are in need of liquid cash. While a few are trying to run the show by partly releasing money to their regulars, majority are still clueless about tiding over the challenge in the changing circumstances. Binu Abraham, a rural farmer, reveals that old currency notes are still in use in many locations as a short-term arrangement to manage the crisis with the mutual consent of sellers and buyers. “In emergency cases, farmers familiar with local traders accept old currency notes and get them exchanged at various banks later,” he adds. George Thottathil, a farmer from Koodaranhi, says: “There are around 10 shops in the Koodaranhi and Koombara regions alone, but none of them makes full payment to their clients owing to shortage of currency notes. Small-scale rubber growers are the worst hit even as their well-off counterparts somehow manage the crisis by granting more time to local traders to clear arrears.” Mr. George also points out that local agriculturists are facing a huge crisis owing to the closure of some rural shops as a result of the currency crisis. “We can’t blame merchants alone as they have been depending on the conventional style of trading with liquid cash for decades,” he adds. P. Saji, a rubber merchant from Thiruvambadi, says only a few farmers in his area know how to use credit and debit cards as they have been meeting daily expenses using liquid cash. “The sudden withdrawal of high-value currency notes has literally shaken them and doubled their turmoil,” he adds. K. Johnson, a farmer and office-bearer of a newly constituted farmer organisation at Koombara, points out that he is also among the several hundreds of frustrated settler farmers who are yet to get the money for the agriculture produce they have sold in the open market. “In the last two weeks, I sold 130 kg of raw rubber to a local merchant. I am yet to get the money as the trader complains of shortage of new currency notes,” he rues. The experience is not any different for coconut farmers. They say the continuing reluctance of small- and large-scale traders to take the stock for more than a week is ultimately fuelling the whole crisis with no easy way out. Owing to shortage of liquid cash for daily transactions, many are opting for the conventional credit purchase from familiar local shops that are yet to get into the modern style of trading involving swipe card machines and internet banking.

431,2016-11-18,11.0,Demonetisation continues to stall Parliament,"Opposition members protest in the well of the Lok Sabha on Friday.  
| Photo Credit: PTI  Parliament was stalled for the second consecutive day on Friday due to ruckus by the Opposition parties, which were demanding in Lok Sabha a debate on monetisation under a rule that entails voting and presence of Prime Minister Narendra Modi in Rajya Sabha for resumption of discussion on the issue. No business could be transacted in either the Upper House or the Lower House due to the pandemonium. In the Lok Sabha, the Congress and some other Opposition parties pressed for a discussion on demonetisation under a rule which entails voting, that too through an Adjournment Motion which means suspension of all business. Several notices were given by various Opposition leaders for discussion under the Adjournment Motion but Speaker Sumitra Mahajan rejected these, saying a debate could take place otherwise. Ruckus started soon after the House met for the day, with Congress leader Mallikarjun Kharge demanding that the issue of scrapping of Rs. 1000 and Rs. 500 notes be discussed through an adjournment motion and not the rule being proposed by the government. Parliamentary Affairs Minister Ananth Kumar said the government was willing to discuss the issue and there was no need to press for an adjournment motion. As the din continued, the House was adjourned for nearly one hour till noon, minutes after it assembled. When the House assembled again for Zero Hour, the Opposition again pressed for moving an adjournment motion. But the Speaker rejected all the notices. Both Mr. Kharge and Trinamool leader Sudip Bandopadhyay insisted that the debate be taken up through an adjournment motion. The Parliamentary Affairs Minister once again urged the Opposition to take up the debate under Rule 193 which does not entail voting and a formal motion. Mr. Kumar said the Opposition should not “run away” from a debate and maintained that it was up to the Chair to decide under which rule the discussion will take place. As part of their Zero Hour references, Meenakshi Lekhi and Gajendra Singh Chauhan (both BJP) raised the issue of remarks made by the Leader of the Opposition in the Rajya Sabha Ghulam Nabi Azad on Thursday linking deaths due to demonetisation crisis to the killings in the Uri terror attack. The remarks were expunged on Thursday night itself. The two BJP members slammed Mr. Azad for the statement and demanded that a resolution be passed against him and he should be asked to apologise in writing. As differences persisted and the Opposition continued to raise slogans like Pradhan Mantri sadan mein aao and Vijay Mallya kahan gaya, the House was adjourned for the day. In the Rajya Sabha where a debate took place on demonetisation for six hours on Wednesday, the discussion could not resume even on Friday as the Congress and some other Opposition parties insisted on presence of the Prime Minister. The House also saw a clash between the Congress and the BJP members as the ruling side raked up Mr. Azad’s controversial comments and demanded apology from the Congress. Slogans and counter-slogans in the Upper House forced its adjournment, first till 11.30 a.m., then till noon, then till 12.33 p.m., after that till 2.30 p.m. and finally for the day. Soon after listed papers were laid on the table of the House, BJP members moved into aisles shouting slogans and demanding an apology from Mr. Azad for his remarks. Congress members too rushed into the Well raising slogans demanding presence of the Prime Minister and an apology from him as well as the government for the hardship caused to the common man due to withdrawal of 86 per cent of the currency in circulation. The AIADMK members were also in the Well raising slogans over the Cauvery water issue. Deputy Chairman P.J. Kurien asked all members to leave the Well and return to their seats, assuring them that he would hear their submissions. Amid the din, Minister of State for Parliamentary Affairs Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi alleged that Mr. Azad’s statement had given a message to the country that the Congress was sympathetic to terrorism and asked why it was so agitated when the demonetisation drive was only to hurt black money hoarders. Mr. Kurien persuaded the AIADMK and the Congress members to withdraw from the Well, telling them that he would give opportunity to their leaders to raise their respective issues. But with BJP members continuing to stand in the aisles and raising slogans, the Congress members too were back in the Well, shouting slogans. Mr. Kurien said Treasury benches should not create problems for the Chair. “If you do this, what do I do? You should cooperate with me in running the House. Treasury benches should not disrupt,” he said. But the din continued, forcing him to adjourn the proceedings till 11.30 a.m. There was no change in the scenario when the House reassembled as both the BJP and the Congress members again started raising slogans. While the Congress members trooped into the Well, several AIADMK members were seen standing at their places. As the slogans and counter-slogans continued, the Chair adjourned the House till noon. After repeated adjournments, when the House met again at 2.30 p.m., Opposition members continued to create ruckus. Congress leader Anand Sharma accused the government of not wanting the House to run and for “destroying the poor” with his policies. In the melee, the Deputy Chairman asked the MPs to introduce the Private Member’s Bill amid continuous sloganeering by the opposition and treasury benches. Prior to this, he read out a decision by Lok Sabha Speaker Sumitra Mahajan on a private member’s bill for special package to Andhra Pradesh after its reorganisation, moved in the last session Congress member K.V.P. Ramachandra Rao. The Bill was referred to the Speaker to ascertain whether it was a money bill and whether it can be introduced in the Upper House. However, Mr. Kurien’s statement could not be heard in the din. Independent MP Rajeev Chandrasekhar moved his Bill to declare any country as state sponsor of terrorism and withdraw economic and trade relations with such country and to create legal, economic and travel sanctions for citizens of that country. Following continuous uproarious scenes, Mr. Kurien adjourned the House till Monday.

  By-elections will be held in two Lok Sabha constituencies and one Assembly constituency in West Bengal on Saturday under the shadow of the Centre’s demonetisation decision. The by-elections will be held in Cooch Behar and Tamluk Lok Sabha constituencies and in Monteswar Assembly constituency. Ruling Trinamool Congress, BJP, Left Front and Congress have fielded their candidates in all three seats. Although the Congress and CPI(M)-led Left Front had contested the Assembly polls held earlier this year, the two decided to part company in this round of by-elections. Demonetisation has become a key issue in the last lap of campaign for the bypolls. Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee did not campaign for the bypolls and left it to the other leaders of her party. Apart from state BJP president Dilip Ghosh, Union minister Babul Supriyo canvassed for his party. WBPCC chief Adhir Chowdhury and CPIM state secretary Surjya Kanta Mishra spearheaded campaign for their party candidates. TMC MLA and party candidate from Tamluk seat Dibyendu Adhikari told PTI, “Demonetisation move has affected every citizen of this country. The common man is suffering. Demonetisation has also impacted our campaign as we are unable to pay the decorators, sound organisers. In Tamluk, most of the rural areas still don’t have proper banking facilities, what will the poor farmers do?” he asked. According CPI(M) and Congress leaders, demonetisation has all of a sudden come up as an issue for the polls as they are receiving feedback that people are inconvenienced due to the new decision. CPI(M) leader Sujan Chakraborty said demonetisation became a prominent issue as the people faced huge problems and added that the situation was much worse in rural areas. The BJP, on the other hand, said that by-elections would be a litmus test for political parties. “What TMC, Congress and CPI(M) are saying is not right. People of Bengal are happy with the decision and will give a hands down victory to our candidates,” state BJP president Dilip Ghosh said. “It’s not a question of black money or white money. All of a sudden if you scrap high value notes how will you meet various expenditures for the campaign,” Congress candidate from Monteswar Bulbul Ahmed Sheikh said. By-election in Cooch Behar was necessitated by the death of TMC MP Renuka Sinha while the by-election in Tamluk in East Medinipur district was caused by the resignation of TMC MP Suvendu Adhikari who also won the Assembly poll and joined the state cabinet as transport minister. The bypoll to Monteswar Assembly seat in Burdwan district is due to death of TMC MLA Sajal Panja.

436,2016-11-18,11.0,Campaign against demonetisation,"awareness : Members of the Makkal Athikaram distributing pamphlets to public waiting near banks and ATMs in Tiruchi on Thursday.
  The Makkal Adigaram has launched a campaign against the demonetisation of Rs.500 and Rs.1000 notes. Its members distributed pamphlets accusing the Central government of carrying out a surgical strike against the common man to cover its failures on all fronts. The pamphlets claimed that the demonetisation would not help bring out the black money, which were stashed away in foreign countries and in various forms of investments in gold and real estate. Black money hoarders would not be affected by the move, it claimed. The organisation demanded why the common man should be made to suffer when they were not responsible for the rise in black money, fake currencies and corruption. Its members distributed the pamphlets to those standing in queues at banks in different parts of the city on Thursday. “We are staging street plays in various places to create awareness among the people and asking them to resist the move,” said P.Dharmaraj, coordinator, Makkal Adigaram, Tiruchi. The first phase of this campaign would continue till November 20, he said. Members of the district wing of the Tamil Nadu State Cooperative Bank All Employees’ Association staged a demonstration in front of the Collelctor’s Office here on Thursday to highlight their difficulties as transactions in cooperative societies and banks have come to a standstill following the demonetisation. Led by T. Balasubramanian, district secretary of the association, they raised slogans urging the Centre to evolve ways and means for normal functioning of primary cooperative societies in rural areas. M. Ramachandran, district president, said that secretaries could neither get old currencies from those who repaid loans nor make disbursements. “No transaction can be effected at these institutions, which form the grass-root of the banking system,” they said in a memorandum to the Collector, S. Ganesh. Meanwhile, the serpentine queue in front of the branches of nationalised banks continued on Thursday. Indelible ink was applied on customers’ fingers. No sooner an automated teller machine was re-filled with cash, a large crowd of customers vied with one another in withdrawing the money leaving it dry within a few hours.

The 60-year-old small businessman from Birbhum district of Bengal has even tried to argue that he is disabled and need not stand in queues. “Even on Wednesday, I went to an ATM, but by the time I reached the machine, the cash was exhausted,” Mr. Sheikh said. Earlier this week, a public interest litigation [PIL] petition by seven persons with serious disabilities was filed in the Calcutta High Court seeking a modification in the Central Gazette notification of November 8 announcing the demonetisation.

438,2016-11-18,11.0,Currency ban effect: petty corruption down,"Some had packed up and left, while others wound down the clock by taking a walk or chatting over a cup of tea. Touts at the usually buzzing complex that houses the Regional Transport Office, the Sub-Registrar’s office and an Indian Railways reservation centre in Noida’s Sector 33 were simply waiting and watching on Thursday. Since the government withdrew Rs.500 and Rs.1,000 notes, the subsequent liquidity crunch has hit business for touts, who rely on small cash payments. For the 150-odd touts outside the Noida complex, about 80 per cent of business had evaporated in the week since Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s demonetisation announcement. Govind, who calls himself an “advisor” on all things related to RTO, said that not only was work down, but some clients were still trying to use the old currency notes. Another RTO tout, Kunal Verma (name changed), said he had seen only two customers on Thursday, down from the average 10 he would get before the cash crunch. “I had to turn those two away as they did not have money,” he said. Ravi Agarwal, a stamp paper vendor, said he was left with barely 20 per cent of the daily business he would get on an ordinary day. “Even though our work is suffering, this is a good move. It is affecting the common people right now, but if black money is removed, it is worth it,” he said. As the touts wait for business, the transport, registrar and railway offices themselves have seen the usually long queues shrink. The scene was similar at a Passport Seva Kendra at Delhi’s Herald House. Usually busy, there appeared to be no rush outside the passport office on Thursday. According to Rama Nath Jha, executive director of Transparency International India, this was because the “delivery of services” had been hit. He added that once cash flow is restored and services bounce back, so would petty corruption as the demand for quick access to services would increase. “Petty corruption will not be affected in the long-run. But, demonetisation of high-value currency notes in circulation is a conventional method to curb corruption,” said Mr. Jha. However, he did say that long-lasting change would only happen if the ongoing “note wapsi” was followed by “strong anti-corruption laws, tax reforms, digitisation of property transfer and more use of technology in governance.” Printable version | Jan 7, 2017 1:23:03 AM | http://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/Currency-ban-effect-petty-corruption-down/article16528380.ece © The Hindu The Hindu revisits the gruesome December 2012 gang-rape to examine if Delhi is any safer for the average woman today"
439,2016-11-18,11.0,"?Changing foreign currency, a challenge?","Changing foreign currency to Indian rupees is still an issue for many tourists, who have also been unable to exchange the demonetised notes. Indiran, a visitor from Malaysia, who had come down to shop for a wedding in the family and visit temples in Manthralayam and Tirupati, said as far as stay was concerned, there was no problem since they could pay by card. “But it is a problem when one has to pay for the taxi or buy puja items for the temples. I had to borrow some cash from a few friends in Chennai,” he said. Some hoteliers said they were still accepting Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,000 notes from customers who were unable to change them. “For the first few days, there was no cash with money changers, so we had to help them. They are not able to change for more than Rs. 5,000, given the ceiling on exchange. That is hardly enough for the kind of spending that many of them like to do when they are here,” a city hotelier said. In some places where banks and forex counters were not helping tourists, they were forced to approach touts to get their notes exchanged, a travel operator said. N. Nageswaran, secretary general, All India Association of Authorized Money Changers and Money Transfer Agents, said in the first few days, there was a problem of currency not being available in money exchange counters. “We directed the consumers to the banks that had money. But the situation has eased since we have been allowed to draw from banks. There is no doubt that there are hitches still, but we have asked our members to interact with banks and help our customers,” he said.

440,2016-11-18,11.0,Demonetisation issue brings Parliament to a halt,"The Opposition and the government clashed over the demonetisation issue on Thursday, bringing both Houses to a halt. The Lok Sabha functioned only for question hour amid a steady uproar, adjourning for the day well before 1 p.m. The Rajya Sabha, meanwhile, was repeatedly adjourned, as the Congress-led Opposition mounted a sharp and relentless attack on the government. This was in sharp contrast to the peaceful discussion on Wednesday. In the Upper House, the Opposition made it clear it was not satisfied merely with responses from Union Finance Minister Arun Jaitley, even as remarks made by Leader of the Opposition Ghulam Nabi Azad about the Uri terror attack in the context of demonetisation forced the final adjournment for the day. The Lok Sabha witnessed continuous disruptions before being adjourned for the day, with Speaker Sumitra Mahajan turning down the Opposition’s demand for an adjournment motion on the issue. As soon as the proceedings started, Congress leader Mallikarjun Kharge demanded that the Chair accept the adjournment motion but Union Parliamentary Affairs Minister Anant Kumar said the government was ready only for a debate under Rule 193. Neither side yielded, and the Congress and other Opposition MPs continued to shout slogans. Ms. Mahajan then said Opposition MPs did not seem to want a discussion, and only sought to disrupt the House. Eventually, the House was adjourned till 12.30 p.m. When the Lok Sabha reassembled, Mr. Kharge again raised the demand for an adjournment motion. Ms. Mahajan simply said, “I have disallowed the adjournment.” The uproar continued unabated, and the Speaker adjourned the House for the day. In the Rajya Sabha that witnessed a six-hour-long debate on demonetisation on Wednesday, the Opposition had pressed for the presence of Prime Minister Narendra Modi in the House and a response from him. On Thursday, as the discussion continued, the Rajya Sabha was repeatedly adjourned as Opposition MPs rushed into the well.

PTI A day after he described Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s November 8 decision to withdraw 500 and 1,000 rupee notes from circulation as a “bold move”, billionaire businessman and philanthropist Bill Gates said on Thursday he had “no opinion” on the issue. In a NITI Aayog lecture on Wednesday, Mr. Gates described Mr. Modi’s decision as an “important step” to move away from a “shadow economy to an even more transparent economy”. To a specific question from The Hindu on Thursday at a select media roundtable on whether he supported demonetisation, Mr. Gates stated that he had “no opinion” on the issue. Mr. Gates, however, predicted that India would go digital very rapidly and pointed to the process in countries like Kenya, where his foundation had worked. Government payments alone justified the digital path in India, he stressed. When a reporter pointed out that India was a cash dependent economy, Mr. Gates responded: “That’s true”. He also felt that the Aadhaar, or India’s identity card system, was a “fantastic thing”. In his Wednesday lecture, Mr. Gates said digital transactions would rise dramatically in India. “I think in the next several years India will become the most digitised economy. Not just by size but percentage as well.” Mr. Gates was of the view that Aadhaar had not been attempted anywhere in the world, including in rich countries. “But now you have something that is going to underlie all your digital systems, whether it’s banking, tax payments, tracking healthcare records.” On the reported decline in healthcare spending by the government, Mr. Gates said the spending had been flat. Advocating an increase in healthcare spending, he said in the end this was a political question and he was not a voter in India.

443,2016-11-18,11.0,Naidu to write to Jaitley again on new currency,"Chief Minister N. Chandrababu Naidu did not hide his displeasure over the response and functioning of banks and the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) “at a time of crisis.” At a review meeting here on Thursday, Mr. Naidu said that the bankers should respond swiftly to the problems faced by the public. There were reports that the people were facing problems due to shortage of currency and non-functioning of the Automated Teller Machines (ATMs). The banks should have responded in a much better way, he felt. Mr. Naidu, referring to his letter to Finance Minister Arun Jaitley and RBI Governor Urjit Patel, said that he requested the Centre to despatch new currency notes amounting to Rs. 1,500 crore. Andhra Pradesh, however, received only Rs. 142 crore. The matter would be taken up with the Union Finance Ministry again. “I shall write a letter to Mr. Jaitley requesting him to ensure that currency amounting to Rs. 5,000 crore is despatched to the State,” he said. The RBI released Rs. 140 crore in Rs. 10,20,50 and Rs. 100 denominations. And, Rs. 50 crore worth Rs. 500 notes were yet to reach the State, he said. Mr. Naidu would interact with mobile network service providers on Friday. The Chief Minister would discuss about cashless transactions and mobile banking services with the service providers.

444,2016-11-18,11.0,Trust in the time of demonetisation,"Many years ago, a man called Francis Fukuyama proposed an economic theory that rested on trust. He argued that economic development would be based on the amount of trust each society displayed in non-kin relationships. In his 1996 publication, Trust, he said: “One of the most important lessons we can learn from an examination of economic life is that a nation’s well being, as well as its ability to compete, is conditioned by a single, pervasive cultural characteristic: the level of trust inherent in the society.” This past week, we’ve probably come out with flying colours in a Fukuyama test. Since demonetisation reduced liquidity in the market, with limited sectors accepting Rs. 500 and Rs. 1000 notes as legal tender, and the insufficiency of notes to replace the currency, this society has moved on, largely thanks to trust. At a micro level, people, traders, vendors who are used to cash transactions on a daily basis, sought refuge in credit and trust, hoping the tide would turn again. For auto rickshaw drivers, water can suppliers, milkmen, tea shops, small roadside eateries with their loyal clientele, it was easy to slip into credit mode. Vanessa Peter, who often takes auto rickshaws to commute to work, found it was exactly this which came to her rescue when she hailed an auto at the stand near her house in Kodambakkam, after the demonetisation drive left her short of change. “The driver knows me well and I have taken his auto several times. I told him I did not have the money to pay for my ride that day and he readily agreed to take the money whenever I could pay him.” She later paid the fare two days later. She’s been lucky though. The vendor who supplies drinking water at her home also left behind three cans, though she could only pay for one at that time. Some altruism is part of the business It is not all profit for Samivelu, a water bubble-top supplier in Madipakkam. He said all his customers had promptly made payments all these days, and he felt that water being an essential commodity, it was his duty to ensure they got the water, even if he had to supply it all on credit. For more than half his life, 45-year-old jeweller S.Raman of Perambur has been travelling all over Chennai selling inexpensive, costume jewellery made from beads and metal to homemakers and working women. Mr. Raman, called ‘manikaarar’ had to make adjustments after November 8. A client purchased jewels worth Rs. 6,500 but asked if he could wait until the first week of December for payment. “Don’t worry about it. I have earned your trust over the years and I need nothing more,” he replied. In Coimbatore, several builders have requested the grocery outlets and tea stalls near their construction sites to give products on credit to their workers. With a shortage in the availability of cash to pay weekly wages for the workers, they have only paid an advance amount to these workers. Dhanalakshmi, who has rented out two houses to workers, says her tenants were unable to pay the rent. “How can I ask them when they have not received their wages properly? I know they will pay up when they get money,” she says. Owners of rice mandis, medical shops, local kirana stores and even water suppliers in Chennai knowing well the cap and difficulties in withdrawing cash are not pressuring their customers to pay immediately. S. Anuradha, a resident of Annai Indira Nagar in Velachery, was apprehensive about what to do when she ran out of rice. She was pleasantly surprised when the owner of a rice mandi nearby offered to give her stocks, which she could pay for with a cheque. Retail and wholesale in the same boat At Gandhi Market in Tiruchi, a major wholesale and retail market for the region, many traders have been extending credit lines over the past week. Not strictly due to generosity, but also out of necessity. “Seventy per cent of our business has been affected after demonetisation. Many of us are operating on credit transactions,” said A. Thangaraj, general secretary, Tiruchi Onion Commission Mandi Traders’ Association. “Retail traders who purchase onions from us say they will pay after selling the produce. We realise their position and allow them to take the stocks on credit. We know we may have to wait for even up to a month to get the money,” he said. The same with suppliers. “While we are able to pay our suppliers from other states through bank transfers, we have to withhold cash payments to local farmers who supply us small onions,” he said. Most farmers accept this, but some have stopped bringing the produce to the market. J. Madhavan, who runs a stationery shop in Madurai, said the daily sale of school and college notebooks and accounts books used to be around Rs. 25,000 a day but had plummeted to Rs. 2,000 a day since the announcement. Regular customers like representatives of educational institutions, who used to seek only discounts on notebooks, were now seeking credit for want of currency notes. He had no option but to oblige. Petty shopkeepers too say that sales on credit are on the rise. “We allow most of our regular customers to pay later and allow credit for new customers. In some cases, I do not even make a note of the purchase when the crowd is heavy. Most people do not cheat and pay up in a day or two. Besides, I often find there is no change to give back if a customer produces a Rs.100 note for one tea. I have to ask him to pay later,” said Kumar, who runs a tea stall in Thennur. Trust works both ways There’s also trust from the other side. There are regular customers who pay up tea stalls and vegetable vendors larger notes and ask them to hold the change against future purchases. A bakery owner from Salem says he sells goods on credit only to known customers, and politely turns away others. T. Arunkumar, an advocate at the Madras High Court, said stamp vendors from whom he regularly purchased stamp papers were now lending them on credit. “This is a great help. It is not that clients who approach us for registrations or for filing litigation are without money. They have cash but due to the demonetisation there are practical problems in converting the old currencies with the prevailing day and weekly limits in force.” Particularly, for any kind of registrations involving a immovable property, be it a settlement, gift or a release deed, one would require a minimum of Rs. 20,000 value stamp papers. The alternative is to pay by a demand draft, but again it is a time consuming option given the rush in the banks to deposit and exchange old currencies. A vendor confirmed, “Yes, we do give them on credit but not for all. We can trust only those who are regularly doing business with us for years.” But trust too, seems to have a threshold level. With the situation not improving in the last week, and liquidity going from bad to worse, traders and vendors have begun to fret. “To avoid embarrassment, provisions are sold on credit to select customers. By and large, we turn away buyers seeking credit purchase,” Jebastin Solomon, a grocery shop owner at K.K.Nagar, said, adding that it is simply impossible to conduct business without even a minimal cash flow for too long. Clearly trust too is going to run out if liquidity does not improve. An addendum to Mr. Fukuyama’s theory will probably be written in this country. (With inputs from Dennis S.

rajendra singh hajeri With the Union government barring all credit cooperative societies from accepting demonetised Rs. 1,000 and Rs. 500 currency notes, lakhs of farmers who have taken crop loans and other loans are facing the danger of being termed defaulters and paying penal interest of 14 per cent. The Reserve Bank of India has barred district central cooperative banks which have thousands of credit cooperative societies attached to them from accepting the demonetised notes, a move which has been criticised strongly by many cooperative leaders and farmers. While the immediate impact of the decision is that the societies have become cash-starved because of non availability of cash with farmers, the worst affected among the farmers will be those who have neared the deadline for repaying their crop loans. “Farmers have taken annual crop loans ranging from Rs. 10,000 to Rs. 3 lakh. If they do not return them in 365 days, they will lose interest incentive and will be termed defaulters. Most of them want to repay loans in old currency, but we are helpless,” chairman of the Bidar District Central Cooperative Bank Umakanth Nagamarapalli said. Karnataka Central Cooperative Bank of Dharwad, which has 550 credit cooperative societies with 1.5 lakh farmers under it, has already felt the pinch. “Even a day’s delay will make them defaulters and they have to pay 14 per cent interest. The RBI has said nothing about it in its directions,” said the bank’s chairman I.S. Patil. “We have to function as per the RBI guidelines. This is a blow to cooperative societies that take care of farmers,” Mr. Patil said. Honorary president of the Karnataka Rajya Raita Sangha Chamarasa Malipatil demanded that farmers who are nearing deadline should be allowed to repay the loan in old currency notes. “Otherwise, the penal interest should be waived,” he said. Handling charges Urban credit cooperative banks are being asked to give undertakings that they would pay “handling charges” for the old currency notes. The director of a noted urban cooperative bank in Hubballi said officials of the State Bank of India and Axis Bank asked them to give the undertaking. While one bank told them that they were “likely” to be asked to pay handling charges of Re. 1 for every Rs. 1,000 (in old currency), the other bank told it could be around Rs. 4 per Rs. 1,000. “For banks which are receiving deposits of around Rs. 1 crore it will come to Rs. 10,000 to Rs. 40,000 per day,” he said. Bidar DCC bank in a fix The Bidar District Central Cooperative Bank, the biggest lender in the district, is in a fix. It has collected Rs. 113 crore in the week after the demonetisation, but nationalised banks are refusing to accept this pile of cash as the Union government has barred all cooperative societies from accepting demonetised notes. “The collections — exchanged noted and deposits — from November 9 have totalled to Rs. 113 crore. But no nationalised bank is accepting it. What do we do now?’’ asked Umakanth Nagamarapalli, BDCC bank chairman. He said over 70 per cent of farmers in the district were getting crop loans from their societies or village branches. “Our problem is compounded as we are supposed to pay a 4 per cent interest on money thus collected. If the government does not accept this as legal deposit, how can we pay interest to depositors?” he said. The bank, which is a federation of 45 branches and 171 primary agriculture cooperative societies, has nearly 4.91 lakh deposit accounts and 2.23 loan accounts. It has 3.75 lakh SHG accounts. The bank also maintains heavy duty accounts like those of the five sugar factories in the district. He also complained that currency chests in nationalised banks were releasing only around Rs. 20 lakh a day to the bank. “This means that we can not transact less than Rs. 1 lakh per branch per day,” he said.

Bhagya Prakash K When most people in cities are panicking over the impact of demonetisation, innovative farmer H. Sadananda from Tapasihalli in Doddaballapur taluk, Bengaluru Rural district, remains unperturbed. As he grows nearly 30 crop varieties as part of his integrated farming on a small tract of 2.1 acres. He is living only on the produce from his farm which includes vegetables, greens, eggs, chicken, milk, and fish. “This is mostly our normal life. The only extra effort I made was avoiding going to the petrol station to get fuel for my vehicle,” he says. “I can manage like this for the next one to two weeks if there are no medical or other emergencies,” he says. He adds that life is “almost normal” for other integrated farmers like him. According to Mr. Sadananda, who has bagged the Indian Council of Agricultural Research’s national award, those practising integrated farming have always withstood any problems in economy as well as monsoon vagaries.

  Condemning the Centre’s demonetisation policy, members of Tamil Nadu Primary Agricultural Cooperative Bank All Employees Association staged a demonstration on the premises of the Collectorate here on Thursday. Nelson Devapichai, district president of the association, who led the agitation, said the Centre had demonetised Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,000 currency notes, but the people were unable to get fresh currencies. Farmers were also affected as in the wake of the demonetisation exercise Primary Agricultural Cooperative Banks (PACBs) remained almost paralysed. Only when fresh currencies became available the operations would be resumed in the PACBs. Poor farmers had been relying on the PACBs and cooperative credit societies for their monetary needs, but now they were forced to go to towns to withdraw money. The PACBs also could not cater to the needs of the farmers, the protesters said. Moreover, the farmers were unable to insure their crops and the women self-help group members were unable to repay loans. The public also faced hardship as they could not withdraw cash deposits and jewels pledged in cooperative societies as 154 of primary agricultural cooperative credit societies had been remaining closed for the last eight days, they alleged. In Tirunelveli, members of the association, led by its State general secretary K. Muthu Pandian, staged a demonstration near Palayamkottai market. As many as 160 primary agricultural cooperative credit societies across Tirunelveli district remained closed. Nagercoil Urging the government to implement a seven-point charter of demands, the members of Tamil Nadu State Agricultural Cooperative Employees Association, who gathered in front of the Collectorate in Nagercoil, alleged that thousands of farmers were in a fix as they could not close their crop and jewel loans before due dates, as Primary Agricultural Cooperative Credit Societies (PACCS) were not authorised to receive the invalidated currencies. The demonetisation exercise had also made farmers lose the interest subsidy from the government, said P. Victor Doss, vice- president of the association. Kanniyakumari District Central Cooperative Bank (KDCCB) should replace the invalidated currencies from the PACCS and allow the societies to withdraw funds from Savings Bank accounts. The farmers and PACCS members were unable to redeem pledged jewels due to the cap on weekly withdrawal from banks. The farmers should be allowed to redeem their jewels based on the proof submitted by them, he urged. Association president S. Sahaya Thilakraj presided. KDCCB president Sampath Chandra and association office-bearers participated.

448,2016-11-18,11.0,Currency ban effect: petty corruption down,"The liquidity crunch has hit business of touts, who are dependent on small cash payments.Photo: Special Arrangement
  Some had packed up and left, while others wound down the clock by taking a walk or chatting over a cup of tea. Touts at the usually buzzing complex that houses the Regional Transport Office, the Sub-Registrar’s office and an Indian Railways reservation centre in Noida’s Sector 33 were simply waiting and watching on Thursday. Business down by 80% Since the government withdrew Rs.500 and Rs.1,000 notes, the subsequent liquidity crunch has hit business for touts, who rely on small cash payments. For the 150-odd touts outside the Noida complex, about 80 per cent of business had evaporated in the week since Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s demonetisation announcement. Govind, who calls himself an “advisor” on all things related to RTO, said that not only was work down, but some clients were still trying to use the old currency notes. Turning away clients Another RTO tout, Kunal Verma (name changed), said he had seen only two customers on Thursday, down from the average 10 he would get before the cash crunch. “I had to turn those two away as they did not have money,” he said. Ravi Agarwal, a stamp paper vendor, said he was left with barely 20 per cent of the daily business he would get on an ordinary day. “Even though our work is suffering, this is a good move. It is affecting the common people right now, but if black money is removed, it is worth it,” he said. As the touts wait for business, the transport, registrar and railway offices themselves have seen the usually long queues shrink. The scene was similar at a Passport Seva Kendra at Delhi’s Herald House. Usually busy, there appeared to be no rush outside the passport office on Thursday. According to Rama Nath Jha, executive director of Transparency International India, this was because the “delivery of services” had been hit. He added that once cash flow is restored and services bounce back, so would petty corruption as the demand for quick access to services would increase. Need more tax reforms “Petty corruption will not be affected in the long-run. But, demonetisation of high-value currency notes in circulation is a conventional method to curb corruption,” said Mr. Jha. However, he did say that long-lasting change would only happen if the ongoing “note wapsi ” was followed by “strong anti-corruption laws, tax reforms, digitisation of property transfer and more use of technology in governance.” Experts say that strong anti-corruption laws must follow to ensure long-lasting change Printable version | Jan 7, 2017 1:23:22 AM | http://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/Currency-ban-effect-petty-corruption-down/article16666966.ece © The Hindu The Hindu revisits the gruesome December 2012 gang-rape to examine if Delhi is any safer for the average woman today"
449,2016-11-18,11.0,M.P. by-polls first litmus test for BJP after demonetisation,"As campaigning ends on Thursday for the November 19 by-elections to the Shahdol Lok Sabha and Nepanagar Assembly seats, the ruling BJP will face its first litmus test since demonetisation of Rs.500 and Rs.1,000 notes. Retaining both the ST seats in this by-polls will be crucial for the BJP as if it loses any one of them it will be construed that the decision to scrap high denomination currency has not gone down well with the people, a Congress leader said. However, a BJP leader exuded confidence of retaining both the seats with a comfortable margin and claimed that the issue of demonetisation will not affect its poll prospects. “People were facing grave problems with this dictatorial order. Both common man and farmers were forced to stand in long queues. Farmers are not having money to purchase fertilizers and seeds,” Madhya Pradesh Congress president Arun Yadav told PTI. “People are highly annoyed with the decision and I am sure that they will vote against the BJP on the issue,” Mr. Yadav said. They are already facing a lot of problems because of lack of development and tall claims of the government that people are getting 24x7 power supply in the State. Now, the decision to demonetise Rs.1000 and Rs.500 notes has added further fuel to the fire, the Congress leader said. Not an issue However, BJP leader and Madhya Pradesh State Civil Supplies Corporation Ltd chairman Hitesh Bajpai said that demonetisation was not an issue in tribal-dominated areas. “They are more concerned with issues of getting land lease rights, their staple food is rice and jowar and they are happy with it,” he said. “(Earlier) the party had won the Shahdol seat with a margin of over two lakh votes and I am sure that we will retain it with a difference of more than 1.5 lakh ballots,” he said. Public meetings MP Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan and State BJP president Nandkumar Singh Chauhan, former Union Minister Kamal Nath, Jyotiraditya Scindia and State Congress president Arun Yadav have addressed series of public meetings to woo voters and drum up support for their respective parties. Mr. Chouhan has frequented Shahdol to ensure that the BJP retains the seat.

450,2016-11-18,11.0,No let-up in cash rush on Day 9 of demonetisation,": Nine days after demonetisation, there was no let—up in the rush and long queues outside banks and ATMs across the country Thursday while authorities maintained that the cash crunch situation has improved substantially and there was no panic. As the political slugfest over the demonetisation inside and outside Parliament escalated, banks struggled to manage huge rush of people thronging branches to exchange scrapped Rs 500 and Rs 100 notes and get cash to meet their daily needs. Despite some ATMs getting calibrated to dispense Rs 500 notes, such vending machines were running out of cash because of huge pressure of withdrawal. Queues at some branches in the metros were tad shorter for exchange of old currencies as the process of putting indelible ink commenced yesterday. As a result of this, those who have already traded old currency notes are unable to exchange again on the same day due to the ink mark. Finance Minister Arun Jaitley said the rush at bank branches has come down significantly today and that there is absolutely no panic. With the government and RBI struggling to ease cash availability, the small businesses — from vegetable vendors to dhabas and small kirana stores — that use cash as mode of transaction were the worst hit. Work at standstill A bulk of daily labourers were rendered jobless as construction and other activities came to a standstill in the wake of cement, sand and other supplies not coming in. Truckers too were reportedly stranded on highways as drivers ran out of valid currency notes, affecting movement of goods in several parts of the country. While some banks in Kolkata accepted cash, most of them stopped disbursing it mainly due to cash crunch, with a number of ATMs in and around the city putting up either “no cash” or “temporary out of service” notice. “I am here from Assam to pursue my MA from Calcutta University. My family sends money and I use my debit card to access it. The card has expired last week and I am unable to pay my bills. Neither am I able to withdraw anything because I do not have cheques. I am left with a few Rs 500 notes to exchange...I have to skip classes to come to bank everyday for this,” Anirban Burman said in Kolkata. Shortage of small change has hit the state—run liquor outlets, vegetable markets and small vendors in Tamil Nadu even as large number of people continued to throng various banks and ATMs which ran dry within few hours. “Shortage of small currency like Rs 100 or Rs 50 has crippled financial transactions,” said a customer waiting in queue before a public sector bank in Chennai. A group of women, affiliated to All India Democratic Women Association, symbolically performed ‘last rites’ of an ATM in Coimbatore in protest against its non—functioning. Floral tributes Since no money was coming from the machine, it was now dead and the women were performing its last rites, by paying floral tributes, an AIDWA representative said.

  The pilgrim rush continues at the world-famous Lord Venkateswara temple even after the demonetisation of high-value currency by the Centre. Offerings too continue to pour into the hundi. The hill town has recorded over 5.13 lakh footfalls in the last eight days aggregating an average of 64,176 pilgrims per day. Likewise, the hundi has also registered a whopping income of over Rs. 22.9 crore. But several other renowned temples in the State have been hit hard. A report by the Endowments Department suggests that there is a decline by 10-25 per cent in the number of people undertaking pilgrimages to various places of worship. The temple at Sri Kalahasti has reported a drastic decline in the number of devotees performing the ‘Rahu-Kethu’ pooja – to which the devout attach immense significance, and the Srisailam temple has recorded an erosion by over 20 per cent in the number of pilgrims. Meanwhile, speculation continues to persist that the Tirumala temple which is known for its vast riches, will remain the ultimate beneficiary of the withdrawal of the legal tender status for Rs.500 and Rs.1,000 currency notes. The hundi, which nets an income of more than Rs. 1,000 crore in the form of offerings in addition to about one tonne of gold and three to four tonnes of silver articles year among other valuables, in all probability is expected to receive voluminous deposits either during the last couple of weeks of December when the deadline for exchange and deposits of the old currency notes expires or by the end of March as specified by the Reserve Bank of India.

452,2016-11-18,11.0,Naidu to write to Jaitley again on new currency,"Chief Minister N. Chandrababu Naidu did not hide his displeasure over the response and functioning of banks and the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) “at a time of crisis.” At a review meeting here on Thursday, Mr. Naidu said that the bankers should respond swiftly to the problems faced by the public. There were reports that the people were facing problems due to shortage of currency and non-functioning of the Automated Teller Machines (ATMs). The banks should have responded in a much better way, he felt. Mr. Naidu, referring to his letter to Finance Minister Arun Jaitley and RBI Governor Urjit Patel, said that he requested the Centre to despatch new currency notes amounting to Rs. 1,500 crore. Andhra Pradesh, however, received only Rs. 142 crore. The matter would be taken up with the Union Finance Ministry again. “I shall write a letter to Mr. Jaitley requesting him to ensure that currency amounting to Rs. 5,000 crore is despatched to the State,” he said.

453,2016-11-18,11.0,"Acute shortage of currency, small change continues","Nine days after the demonetisation of high-value currency notes, ATMs in the district continued to run dry, in most cases, on Thursday, while banks in the district faced severe shortage of small value currency. “Only around 30 per cent of the 1,400 ATMs [not counting those operated by cooperative banks] in the district dispensed money on Thursday, as there was acute shortage of currency notes of Rs.50 and Rs.100 denominations. Meanwhile, some recalibrated ATMs dispensed Rs.2,000, which people found useless for want of change,” Bank Employees Federation of India State general secretary S.S. Anil said. Sources indicated that while nearly 70 per cent of ATMs operated by the SBI and associates functioned intermittently, banks that had outsourced ATM operations failed to load cash. ATMs located on bank branch premises dispensed cash, but standalone ones largely remained cashless. “While there was talk of the new Rs.500 notes making it to banks, they are yet to reach. Besides, the new Rs.2,000 notes, there were primarily Rs.20 and Rs.10 notes in mostly soiled and crumpled condition,” they said. All Kerala Bank Employees Federation general secretary C.D. Josson said: “There was a clear drop in the number of people turning up to exchange demonetised notes. Use of stained, torn, and soiled notes was the order of the day,” he added. Mr. Anil said demonetisation had almost arrested lending, and that business transactions had dropped by nearly 70 per cent over the last week. “The use of indelible ink was also sporadic,” he added. The non-availability of small change forced people to form ‘informal currency’ in the form of promise notes. Some small shops outside the city had displayed notices saying they did not take Rs.2,000 for want of change.

  The Makkal Adigaram has launched a campaign against the demonetisation of Rs.500 and Rs.1000 notes. Its members distributed pamphlets accusing the Central government of carrying out a surgical strike against the common man to cover its failures on all fronts. The pamphlets claimed that the demonetisation would not help bring out the black money, which were stashed away in foreign countries and in various forms of investments in gold and real estate. Black money hoarders would not be affected by the move, it claimed. The organisation demanded why the common man should be made to suffer when they were not responsible for the rise in black money, fake currencies and corruption. Its members distributed the pamphlets to those standing in queues at banks in different parts of the city on Thursday. “We are staging street plays in various places to create awareness among the people and asking them to resist the move,” said P.Dharmaraj, coordinator, Makkal Adigaram, Tiruchi. The first phase of this campaign would continue till November 20, he said. Protest in Pudukottai Members of the district wing of the Tamil Nadu State Cooperative Bank All Employees’ Association staged a demonstration in front of the Collelctor’s Office here on Thursday to highlight their difficulties as transactions in cooperative societies and banks have come to a standstill following the demonetisation. Led by T. Balasubramanian, district secretary of the association, they raised slogans urging the Centre to evolve ways and means for normal functioning of primary cooperative societies in rural areas. M. Ramachandran, district president, said that secretaries could neither get old currencies from those who repaid loans nor make disbursements. “No transaction can be effected at these institutions, which form the grass-root of the banking system,” they said in a memorandum to the Collector, S. Ganesh. Meanwhile, the serpentine queue in front of the branches of nationalised banks continued on Thursday. Indelible ink was applied on customers’ fingers. No sooner an automated teller machine was re-filled with cash, a large crowd of customers vied with one another in withdrawing the money leaving it dry within a few hours.

Naveen Kumar M., director of the firm, told The Hindu that many candidates, who had completed training, had not paid the fee amount. After the announcement by the Union government to withdraw Rs. 1,000 and Rs. 500 denomination notes last Tuesday, at Enet Informatics, the demonetised notes were accepted as fee from the candidates who had enrolled for the courses on earlier date. A major chunk of students, who had turned defaulters have cleared their fee by making payment in Rs. 1,000 and Rs. 500 notes. Of Rs. 1.50 lakh that had remained due from the students from past one year, Rs. one lakh was cleared on Wednesday and Thursday, he added.

456,2016-11-18,11.0,Will demonetisation turn farmers into defaulters?,"With the Union government barring all credit cooperative societies from accepting demonetised Rs. 1,000 and Rs. 500 currency notes, lakhs of farmers who have taken crop loans and other loans are facing the danger of being termed defaulters and paying penal interest of 14 per cent. The Reserve Bank of India has barred district central cooperative banks which have thousands of credit cooperative societies attached to them from accepting the demonetised notes, a move which has been criticised strongly by many cooperative leaders and farmers. While the immediate impact of the decision is that the societies have become cash-starved because of non availability of cash with farmers, the worst affected among the farmers will be those who have neared the deadline for repaying their crop loans. “Farmers have taken annual crop loans ranging from Rs. 10,000 to Rs. 3 lakh. If they do not return them in 365 days, they will lose interest incentive and will be termed defaulters. Most of them want to repay loans in old currency, but we are helpless,” chairman of the Bidar District Central Cooperative Bank Umakanth Nagamarapalli said. Karnataka Central Cooperative Bank of Dharwad, which has 550 credit cooperative societies with 1.5 lakh farmers under it, has already felt the pinch. “Even a day’s delay will make them defaulters and they have to pay 14 per cent interest. The RBI has said nothing about it in its directions,” said the bank’s chairman I.S. Patil. “We have to function as per the RBI guidelines. This is a blow to cooperative societies that take care of farmers,” Mr. Patil said.

457,2016-11-18,11.0,Alleged suicide by businessman for 'failing to exchange currency',"Virendra Kumar Basoya
  : A 26-year-old businessman allegedly hanged himself at his home in south Delhi’s Neb Sarai on Thursday. His wife has claimed that he was frustrated at not being able to procure usable notes in place of Rs. 12 lakh in banned currencies. The deceased has been identified as Virendra Kumar Basoya, owner of a showroom for LED products. According to his wife, Ronak Basoya, he was desperate to get the Rs. 12 lakh cash exchanged and had even contacted some people for help. In vain “One man had offered to charge Rs. 4 lakh (as commission) to exchange the amount, but had sought 15-20 days. That had left him worried,” said Ronak. The couple was also purportedly set to move into their own house this month, but was forced to postpone it because of the demonetisation move. “Virendra had paid the advance amount, and was set to give the rest in cash. He had informed me that he would be vacating my house this month, but because of the ban on currencies, he sought an extension of one month,” said Rizwan Raju, Virendra’s land owner. Ronak further said she was pregnant, but had no money to buy medicines. “The cash problem had led to quarrels between Virendra and me in the last few days. I had borrowed Rs. 500 from a neighbour and had got another Rs. 1,000 exchanged. But that was not enough,” said Ronak. Plans gone awry On November 11, the couple had celebrated their first marriage anniversary, albeit without any fanfare because of lack of money. “We were a happy couple, but the absence of cash created a lot of problems,” said Ronak. Meanwhile, the police said Virendra was in the habit of lending money on interest. They further claimed that he had two wives. The police are also probing what drove Virendra to suicide.

458,2016-11-18,11.0,Demonetisation drive helps MCC mop up revenue,"The Centre’s demonetisation move may have caused inconvenience to people, but has given the Mysuru City Corporation (MCC) reasons to smile. The municipal and local bodies being allowed to accept the scrapped Rs. 1,000 and Rs. 500 notes for payment of taxes and utility charges is helping the cash-strapped MCC fill its coffers. The collection of property tax and water bills by MCC has been continuing at a brisk pace after the government extended the last date for accepting old notes till November 24. The MCC, which collected Rs. 3.17 crore as property tax and water bill due from November 9 to 15, crossed the Rs. 4-crore mark on November 16. “We collected more than Rs. 4 crore in six days, starting November 9, excluding Saturday and Sunday,” MCC Commissioner G. Jagadeesha told The Hindu . To capitalise on the extension of last date for accepting old notes, the MCC is using multimedia communications to reach out to property owners and water consumers to clear dues. The MCC has directed their nine zonal offices to dispatch vehicles fitted with public address system to announce acceptance of the old notes for payment of dues. “We will continue this drive till November 24,” Mr. Jagadeesha added. Deputy Commissioner (Revenue) Kumar Naik said MCC has tied up with Kotak Mahindra bank, which has set up kiosks in the zonal offices, to help the public pay their dues. “While MCC personnel at the kiosk will assist in filling out the challan, the bank representatives will collect the cash,” Mr. Naik said. While the property tax collection target for 2016-17 is Rs. 200 crore, Mr. Jagadeesha said the MCC had so far collected Rs. 73 crore. The carried over balance of property tax due from previous years amounting to Rs. 50 crore, had been included in the target amount. The MCC had managed to collect about Rs. 28 crore against the target Rs. 33 crore as water dues for 2016-17, he said. However, a balance of Rs. 100 crore from the previous years is still due, he added.

460,2016-11-18,11.0,"?Changing foreign currency, a challenge?","Changing foreign currency to Indian rupees is still an issue for many tourists, who have also been unable to exchange the demonetised notes. Indiran, a visitor from Malaysia, who had come down to shop for a wedding in the family and visit temples in Manthralayam and Tirupati, said as far as stay was concerned, there was no problem since they could pay by card. “But it is a problem when one has to pay for the taxi or buy puja items for the temples. I had to borrow some cash from a few friends in Chennai,” he said. Some hoteliers said they were still accepting Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,000 notes from customers who were unable to change them. “For the first few days, there was no cash with money changers, so we had to help them. They are not able to change for more than Rs. 5,000, given the ceiling on exchange. That is hardly enough for the kind of spending that many of them like to do when they are here,” a city hotelier said. In some places where banks and forex counters were not helping tourists, they were forced to approach touts to get their notes exchanged, a travel operator said. N. Nageswaran, secretary general, All India Association of Authorized Money Changers and Money Transfer Agents, said in the first few days, there was a problem of currency not being available in money exchange counters. “We directed the consumers to the banks that had money. But the situation has eased since we have been allowed to draw from banks. There is no doubt that there are hitches still, but we have asked our members to interact with banks and help our customers,” he said.

463,2016-11-19,12.0,Banks worried over stock of demonetised currency,"Money handlers: The currency note counting and disbursal section at SBH main branch in Adilabad.
 
| Photo Credit: S. HARPAL SINGH;S. HARPAL SINGH - S_ HARPAL SINGH ADILABAD: Banks operating in the four districts — Adilabad, Kumram Bheem Asifabad, Mancherial and Nirmal — are now worried over safety of the building stock of demonetised currency notes in different branches as most of the over 300 bank branches in the four districts do not have ‘proper’ strongrooms. On an average, the main branch of State Bank of Hyderabad in Adilabad town, which is also the Lead Bank, is receiving demonetised currency notes with a face value of Rs. 8 crore every day while some others in important centres like Mancherial and Nirmal are receiving about Rs. 3 crore in old Rs 500 and Rs 1000 notes. The rest of the branches of the 31 banks have received the demonetised notes with a face value of about Rs. 1.5 to Rs. 2 crore by way of exchange during the last 10 days. “Many of our branches in rural areas have about Rs. 2 crore each of demonetised currency notes and safety is the main concern as these branches operate out of private premises which do not have proper strongrooms,” pointed out an official of the Telangana Grameena Bank, which has over 100 branches under its two Regional Offices operating in the rural areas of the four districts. “The SBH, our sponsor bank and the chest branch, should take the notes as our bank will stand to lose heavily in case of any eventuality,” added the worried officer. “Banks can transport the banned currency notes to their own chests as we too are flooded with the exchanged notes. We will accept once RBI clears our pile,” clarified SBH Assistant General Manager P. Umamaheswara Rao. Allocation of notes The TBG has also accused the SBH of discrimination in apportioning of cash for day-to-day operations in its branches. “We are disbursing cash judiciously because of the crunch we are facing,” the AGM explained. “The SBH main branch disburses about Rs. 10 lakh to each of the 10 banks which have their accounts with it while it gives Rs. 50 lakh to the TGB which operates 21 branches. It is not enough for our operations as we have a large customer base and serve in rural areas,” the TGB official noted. The constraint imposed by demonetisation on banking operations is likely to ease somewhat as the government has restricted the quantum value of exchange of old notes to Rs. 2,000. “The move will certainly bring down the demand for valid currency notes,” Mr. Umamaheswara Rao agreed.

In the City of Destiny not to be cowed down due to shortage of currency notes, many having Rs.500 and Rs.1,000 notes which were demonetised on midnight of November 8, have started approaching e-seva centres, BSNL and certain bank counters to pay their dues. Some of them were seen striking a deal with others by convincing them to hand over their Rs.100 notes in exchange of paying their dues by swiping their credit/debit cards. “I came here for treatment of my father-in-law. As we were left with high denomination notes which were declared not a legal tender, I asked one person with two Rs.2,000 notes to give them to me. In exchange, I swiped my credit card,” Sandhya Choudhury, home-maker from Sagarnagar, said. Andhra Bank and a few other banks offering acceptance of old notes for clearing credit dues also came as a big relief to many. “I could pay my entire dues by depositing 10 notes of Rs.1,000,” admitted Ramasubba Rao, private sector employee. Some were seen requesting customers at BSNL MVP Colony service centre to hand over them new note of Rs.2,000 in exchange of old notes. E-seva centres all over the State are accepting property tax and other payments due to the government with old notes. By crowd-sourcing, a Bengaluru-based startup cashnocash.com is providing information on ATMs where cash is available pan India. “Since Monday, the day we launched the website which provides information by typing area pin core, we are getting an overwhelming response,” Hiree co-founder Manjunath Talwar said. NASSCOM 10k startup programme manager (AP & Telangana) Vijay Bawra said the website gives information on ATMs in any city where there is not much rush to enable people to draw cash easily. Meanwhile, online campaign through social media on not to hide Rs.20, Rs.50 and Rs.100 currency notes and circulate them in the market is fast catching up. “We are campaigning online to educate people to circulate small currency notes. This will help street vendors and small businessmen to do their business normally. What will happen if we give them a new Rs.2,000 note for a purchase of Rs.300 or Rs.400,” asked State president-elect of AP Chambers of Commerce & Industry Federation G. Sambasiva Rao. Steel Executives Association secretary Anil Kumar said in his social media campaign: “dear friends.

Among the 56 plantations in the hill station located close to the Parambikulam tiger reserve, hardly 15 are functioning now and most of the employees are daily wagers. Following demonetisation, most of the plantations are yet to pay October month’s salary to the workers. On the other hand, tourism in the hill station has also been badly affected due to the crisis. With none of the shops and eateries in Nelliampathy accepting plastic money, travellers are facing much difficulty. The nearest ATMs are located 40 km away in Nenmara, but there too, these are not functioning. According to managerial staff at AVT Group’s Manaloor Estate, the largest in the Nelliampathy hills, the wages for 800 workers was deposited in the bank two days before the demonetisation was announced. The lone Syndicate Bank branch is unable to release the wages because of the deficiency of currencies. The hill station has more than 6,000 plantation workers. Each tea worker gets daily wages of Rs.310.70 apart from a weekly allowance of Rs 60. In coffee and cardamom estates, there is slight variation. “Most workers prefer to get the money by cash from the bank counter. Majority of them do not have debit cards,” says C. Koyakkutty, a member of the local grama panchayat. ``Among the workers, a huge portion are migrant labourers from North Indian states. They would lose a day’s salary if they take buses to Nenmara or Alathoor to withdraw from banks there. Shops are releasing provisions on credit. But that also is a temporary mechanism,” said Balan Nair, who runs a tea shop. ``The troubles of plantation workers doubled after the currency crisis started hitting rural India. Most of the employees of the tea estates, set up during the British period and now owned by plantation companies, are paid only nominal wages, violating all labour laws. Many of them are still daily wagers, despite more than two decades of service,” points out Reetha, an anganwadi worker.

469,2016-11-19,12.0,How this Mumbai koliwada is tiding over demonetisation,"Every day, this woman, possibly in her 60s, sits on a little durrie, a drugget, and sets up shop right next to the jetty. Ferries transport travellers — around 50 or 60 at a go — to and from Madh Island. It includes young star-crossed lovers, fisherfolk, families on Sunday outings, friends looking to get away. A ticket costs Rs. 3. The area is called Versova gaon. It’s a ‘koliwada’, a colony of fishermen, just outside Mumbai. Versova gaon, which hosts the annual Versova Koli Seafood Festival,is a few minutes from Yari Road, perennial home to younger Bollywood hotshots (like, say, Shahid Kapoor or, earlier, Priyanka Chopra) and also aspiring stars who’re known in Mumbai, both colloquially and condescendingly, as the “strugglers”. The jetty is packed with massive boats that aren’t in use anymore. A fisherman tells me casually that each boat costs Rs. 15 lakh or so (or 15,000 hundred-rupee notes). Within a year, it loses most of that value. The boats stationed here, he says, are now bhangaar, scrap. The woman sells garlic. It’s garlic, but — oddly — you can’t smell it. That’s because the air is thick; smouldering with the whiff of fresh fish. It’s the kind of smell that moves upwards, from the nostrils into the space between the eyebrows before settling into your brain, where you can smell nothing else for the next few hours. During low tide, when all the fish wash ashore, it gets especially bad (or good — I’m no one to judge anyone’s olfactory preferences). Before November 8, business used to be good, the garlic seller tells me. She’d make Rs. 800 a day, sometimes up to a thousand rupees. With that, she could keep her household running, and also buy some new stock to sell. She has three sons. She lost a son eight months ago to dengue. After November 8, she’s making less than half of that. Around Rs. 350 a day. Right now, she’s making just about enough to get by, but with no eye on the future. “People are burning thousand-rupee notes; they’re dumping them into the sea. No one’s giving us anything,” she says, with an odd note in her voice. It’s not anger, possibly resignation or dejection. Hope, though, remains. She’s hoping things will settle down in the next few days. **** ‘Feel the music and dance,’ says the poster at a dance studio called The Dance Floor, which is shut when I get there. Next to it is a departmental store aka supermarket aka kiraane ki dukaan. The man running it — teeth faded, hair grey, earring in one ear, dressed in a classic white shirt — is hunched over his desk, looking dreadfully bored. He points to a plastic jar that’s almost empty. It contains chocolates for Re. 1 each. These jars are such an inescapable part of growing up. You get hold of some loose change and you scamper off to the friendly uncle who runs one such store in literally every neighbourhood. You buy the latest candy that all the other kids are talking about. He can’t replenish the supply fast enough. The owner, Dilip (name changed), talks about how demonetisation has affected the community around him. Business has been impacted considerably. No one is buying because no one has any cash. Which means his stocks aren’t getting over. If they do, he won’t have the cash to buy more. Down the line, his suppliers aren’t getting any goods. It’s a massive slowdown. Which means you sit and hope and wait. Grin and bear it. That’s what Dilip says. He’s not giving credit; no one in the area is, unless you share a good relationship with someone. Just then, this little runt shows up in a red shirt and shorts and floppy hair. No more than two-and-a-half feet tall, he yells out ‘Uncle’ repeatedly. But Dilip can’t even spot him from behind the counter. So the kid hands me a two-rupee coin and points at something. The only word he knows, or is ready to say, is ‘uncle’. He refuses to accept the two candies he’s handed by Dilip, pointing instead at the Gems packet. Dilip tells him that the small Gems packet costs Rs. 5, so he should bring Rs. 3 more. Silence. “Run along,” says Dilip. The kid stands his ground. Within a minute or two, Dilip relents and hands the kid a Dairy Milk bar at a 60 per cent discount. “Khud hi dekh lo,” he says, “ab kya karein.” (You see? What can we do?) **** Closer to the sea, there’s a little congregation happening under a shaded, half-enclosed area, sort of like a panchayat but more relaxed. There’s a man sitting on a makeshift bench. He owns the boats. He has a flowing silver beard, tied at the bottom with a red rubber band. Next to it is a small boat, on which a man sits weaving fishing nets. One net costs Rs. 300. Is anyone buying? Do you have change to return? “Ah, well,” he responds. It is what it is. They’re all aware that business is slow. How do you pay for diesel in the boats? How do you buy the nets? Who’s going to pay for the fish? And in what denomination? Nevertheless, they’re trying to stay positive, hopeful that things will get better soon. They feel this will affect them for at least the next six months, although the immediate crisis should get over in the coming days. They’re telling themselves, and me, that it’s for the greater good. It’s not a lie; they do believe it’ll work out in the long run. But it’s also far more nuanced than that. There’s hope and resentment and cynicism and dejection and optimism all at the same time. They grin, then stop, then laugh, then stare quietly into the distance. One fisherman friend there rues the fact that their cause hasn’t really been taken up. “Humaara koi waaris nahi hai wahaan pe.” (We don’t have a voice.) His laugh sounds bitter. The chaos after the demonetisation is being documented. Is it collateral damage? Do the ends justify it? These are legitimate queries, but walking through this urban fishing village, I suspend all questions. It seems to make more sense to keep my conversations with the people of Versova gaon to just their day-to-day life. I cannot pretend to understand their situation. **** My new friends on the boat insist that I visit the fish market a couple of hundred metres away. While in school, we were accused of sounding like a fish-market every time we got too loud, so I go in expecting chaos. But things seem fairly calm. It’s around 4.00 p.m., so the freshest fish have already been sold. The four women I speak to are trying to get rid of the last batch of jhinga (prawns)in their bucket, and tell me the best time to buy is 2.00 p.m. They go out to sea with their husbands, and come back to the market to sell the catch. They have to pay the boatmen who take them. The leader of the group tells me that they’ve struck up a weekly or monthly deal with these men, so that they don’t have to pay cash for each trip. It’s not credit, more like buying in bulk. An MBA graduate might have said “consignment buying”. The woman offers her last batch of jhinga for Rs. 250. I buy Rs. 100 worth of shrimp, some 40 tiny ones in a little black plastic bag, a little less than half of what’s in the bucket. “I was born in this village,” she says, “and I will die here.” She’s stoic in the face of adversity, maybe even proud, refusing to accept that the last 10 days have affected her. Her colleagues are willing to concede that it’s become quite hard; that everyone’s working extra hours to sell as much as they can. But not her. A young girl in her teens offers to clean the shrimp. I refuse awkwardly and walk away. The mood, as far as I can gather, isn’t one of gloom or simmering rage. There’s barely any concern with the politics of the move. In fact, if anything, there’s empathy. The silver-bearded boat-owner tells me that someone like Rahul Gandhi didn’t need to stand in a queue but he still did. The Prime Minister’s 94-year-old mother didn’t need to exchange her notes, he says, but she still did. It’s all about making do and getting by. And this too shall pass. Akhil Sood is a freelance culture writer from New Delhi who wishes he’d studied engineering instead.

  Shiv Sena on Saturday came out in support of Congress leader Ghulam Nabi Azad, who is under attack from BJP for drawing a comparison between the Uri terror attack casualties and the deaths after demonetisation, saying an apology by him for the comments will not change the truth. The BJP has sought an apology from Mr. Azad, the Leader of Opposition in the Rajya Sabha, for his remarks but he has rejected the demand. “Will the truth change if Azad apologises?” asked an editorial in Sena mouthpiece ‘Saamana’. “In the Uri attack, 20 jawans were martyred. Due to the demonetisation, 40 brave patriots have lost their lives (while standing in queues at banks to exchange demonetised notes). “The difference is in the attackers. Pakistan attacked us in Uri, where in the case of demonetisation (deaths) it was our own rulers,” Sena, a partner of the BJP-led alliance at the Centre, said. “Even if the number of deaths caused by inflation, recession and unemployment rises from 40 to 40 lakh, this government will say they are victims of patriotism. “We only hope that going by this rate, a time will come wherein we have to declare the entire country as a martyr,” Sena said.

Ravindran   Ten days after the demonetisation of Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,000 notes was announced by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, there seems to be little respite for those thronging ATMs and banks to withdraw or exchange their currency what is now illegal tender. Here’s a round-up of all the important developments: 1. On November 19, banks served only their respective customers and did  not exchange old notes from customers of other banks. However, the restriction was not applicable to senior citizens. 2. The Supreme Court on Friday warned that there “may be riots” and refused the government’s plea to stay cases filed against demonetisation in High Courts and lower courts across the country, saying “how can we shut our doors to people when there is a problem of such magnitude.” 3. The exchange limit has been reduced to Rs. 2,000 to ease some pressure on cash demand. Families can withdraw up to Rs. 2,50,000 for weddings. 4. The withdrawal limit from ATMs has been increased from Rs. 2,000 to Rs. 2,500, but this will apply only to the recalibrated ATMs. 5. Several measures were announced to ease the burden on farmers. To ensure sowing in the Rabi season, the government has allowed farmers to withdraw Rs. 25,000 a week against crop loan/kisan credit card. Traders in agricultural mandis will be permitted to draw Rs. 50,000 in cash per week to pay for sundry expenses like wages. While the time limit for payment of crop loan insurance premium has been extended by 15 days, government employees up to Group C have been given an option to draw salary advance in cash. 6. To stop repeat money exchange with invalid currency notes, banks have started applying indelible ink mark on the right index finger of customers in select metro cities. 7. Following the move, the Election Commission asked the Central government to continue its use of indelible ink at banks, but in keeping with the EC’s directions. 8. The exemption deadline for all those services allowed to accept the old Rs. 500 and Rs. 1000 notes was extended to November 24 midnight. These services include petrol pumps, pharmacies, and utility services amongst others. 9. Parliament saw repeated disruptions over the issue. Both Houses ended up being adjourned on the second day of the winter session after Congress leader Ghulam Nabi Azad’s remarks comparing deaths in this period to those in the Uri attacks. MoS for Parliamentary Affairs Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi demanded an apology from Mr. Azad, stalling business further. 10.

| Photo Credit: M_Moorthy Traders affiliated to Tamil Nadu Vanigar Sangankalin Peravai have condemned the Central government for demonetising Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,000 currency notes. A group of traders of the forum who staged a demonstration in the city on Friday charged the Central government of trying to destroy retail traders who had been serving the common people through the demonetisation. It had severely hit the retail trade. If the general public was facing hardship on the one hand to buy even essential commodities, retail traders were facing difficulty in selling their stock, the protestors said. If the government had identified and imprisoned black money holders, gangs involved in circulation of fake currency notes, bank loan defaulters, those depositing their ill-gotten wealth in banks abroad and corrupt politicians, the culture of black money and fake currency could have been wiped out. Should the common man and traders be punished for the inefficiency of officials and those in governance, the protestors said. The Central government had announced this decision with the intention that business should not take place in the shops of retail traders. The Congress and the Bharatiya Janata Party were competing to protect foreign trade and destroy domestic trade, they said. Claiming that the present action of the Central government would not control black money, the protestors said the hidden agenda of the government was to make the common man buy products through online and in malls. The demonstration was led by Sivasakthi Ramanathan, Tiruchi north district president of Tamil Nadu Vanigar Sangankalin Peravai.

478,2016-11-19,12.0,"No demonetisation threat to voter turnout, say Dravidian majors","With people queuing up outside banks and ATMs to source legal tender, one question that emerges in the three Assembly constituencies that go to the polls on Saturday is whether this would impact the voter turnout. A section of observers and leaders of the two Dravidian parties – the AIADMK and the DMK – feel that the turnout of voters will remain unaffected by the crisis triggered by demonetisation. Though the entire Tamil Nadu, like the rest of the country, has been witness to tales of hardship of people either trying to withdraw money from their accounts or exchange the demonetised notes for fresh notes, it will not come in the way of a large number of electors in the three constituencies – Thanjavur, Aravakurichi and Thiruparankundram – turning up on the election day, the parties say. In terms of popular perception, the poll for the Aravakurichi and Thanjavur constituencies is viewed more as a by-poll though election to these seats was scrapped in May this year in the wake of allegations of large-scale bribing of voters. In recent years, especially in the last 10 years, high voter turnout in by-elections has become the norm in the State. Of the 18 by-polls held since October 2006, on five occasions, the turnout exceeded the 80 per cent mark, and on eight occasions, it was in the range of 70 per cent to 79 per cent. In four occasions, the poll percentage varied from 60 per cent to 69 per cent, and only once, it was less than 60 per cent. Even in the general elections, either to the Lok Sabha or to the Assembly, the turnout has been above 70 per cent. In the 2009 and 2014 Lok Sabha polls, the figures were 73.05 per cent and 73.74 per cent, respectively. Similarly, the 2011 and 2016 Assembly elections saw 78.29 per cent and 74.26 per cent turnout. The 2011 figure remains an all-time high for the Assembly elections. Discussing voter behaviour, observers and representatives of the two parties cite political mobilisation as the primary factor for their optimism. Both K.N. Nehru, the DMK’s coordinator for Thanjavur and a seasoned AIADMK Minister looking after Thiruparankundram who requested anonymity, emphasise that the campaign by their parties was quite intensive in the last two weeks. Apart from employing their senior leaders, the two parties had made their volunteers to “interact with electors frequently,” the representatives of the DMK and the AIADMK say. “This time, the turnout will be 80 per cent in all the three constituencies,” Mr. Nehru says, confidently. The campaign style of the two parties has prompted the Pattali Makkal Katchi to lodge a complaint with the Election Commission a few days ago, alleging widespread distribution of money. M.G. Devesahayam, a former civil servant and now an anti-corruption activist, says the present situation, arising out of demonetisation, has been cleverly used by the political parties, considering the fact that there is enough time left for the exchange of the demonetised notes. Giving a left-handed compliment, he describes the response of the parties as a mark of “their fantastic ingenuity.” G, Palanithurai, Chair for Panchayati Raj Studies, Department of Political Science and Development Administration of the Gandhigram Rural Institute, says the voters are also keenly watching how the two dominant parties are reacting to the demonetisation. R.S. Bharathi, DMK’s Rajya Sabha Member of Parliament, says that it is very likely that the people of the State would use the by-poll as an opportunity to express their resentment and anger over demonetisation, which in turn would result in increased turnout.

Fuel stations in Bengaluru had no cash to offer, while some in Mysuru, Kolar and Chickaballapur in Karnataka served cardholders. The system failed to take off in Vijayawada. Outlets in Hyderabad said they were discussing the modalities with State Bank of India officials. State Bank of India officials had claimed that anybody with an SBI debit card could swipe at outlets of State-run oil companies and collect cash, and the scheme could be made operational only in stations with SBI Point-of-Sale (POS) machines. Petrol stations in Bengaluru did not have SBI machines. An HPCL spokesman in Mysuru said the company could dispense to customers if it got sufficient cash from banks. On Friday, several customers in Bengaluru who went to petrol stations had to return disappointed. B.R. Ravindranath, president, Bangalore Petroleum Dealers Association, said, “We have not received an official notification. No one from oil companies or banks has explained the scheme.” A senior SBI official said the scheme involved voluntary participation by the outlets. In New Delhi, petrol stations across the National Capital Region did not dispense currency to debit card holders. Attendants at most petrol stations said that although they were aware of the decision, they had not received instructions. SBI officials in Vijayawada held talks with Indian Oil, Bharat Petroleum, and Hindustan Petroleum to issue Rs. 2,000 in cash. “Distribution of cash may be done from Saturday,” said staff at an IOC pump. Customers in Telangana were awaiting Rs. 2,000 cash to be disbursed at petrol bunks that have Kisan Vikas Kendras (KVKs) to help the rural population, but people in the twin cities also made made enquiries hoping to get cash.

  Samundipuram, Wednesday, 7.30 a.m.

 The yarn bobbins mounted on the creel of the circular interlock machine move seamlessly. A series of bulky movements later, the off-white yarn churns out some more off-white cloth, stretched from under the cylinder of the knitting machine. Venkatachalam, in his mid-50s, stands watching his machines, with his hands crossed behind his back, in his unit in Samundipuram in Tiruppur. The air is thick under the slow grumble of the machines and the steady suspension of off-white dust of the yarn, accentuated by the yellow light bulbs lighting up from underneath each running machine, casting long shifting shadows. Bales of yarn waiting to be fed into the machine and bales of cloth knitted from the yarn ready for the supplier are stacked on the side of the shop floor. This is what remains of the Diwali stock, he says. Venkatachalam had reached the knitting unit at 6 a.m. to run the machines. “My first worker will come in at 8.15 a.m,” he says. Until last week, this unit of 16 machines ran with two workers on round-the-clock shift. They were paid Rs.3,000 each every Saturday. This Monday, >a week after Prime Minister Narendra Modi declared the existing Rs.500 and Rs.1,000 notes invalid, Venkatachalam had cut down two shifts to one. This has meant only alternate days of work for each of the two labourers. “Now, I’ll pay Rs.1,500 each to the two workers this week. No fresh yarn has come, and even if it did, I can’t run the machines without cash,” he says. Last week he produced 600 kilogram of cloth, against the usual 1,500 kilogram per week. He receives cheques from the supplier. But his wages are in cash. Life in the slow lane

 Some 18 kilometres away in Pandian Nagar, Shakthivel is picking up the last of the cloth bundles he had commissioned Karal Marx for cutting. Marx owns a rib-cutter that cuts fabrics into bundles of ribbons that are then stitched up as folding on collars and sleeves of T-shirts. His rib-cutter occupies a 50-sq.-feet space partitioned off his less-than-modest living quarters. The last of the bundles remaining from the Diwali stock supplied by people like Shakthivel are the ones left for work for Marx. At the foot of the rib-cutter is a can full of petrol. “Oh that. I had to fill petrol for my moped. But they refused change and I was forced to buy petrol for the entire money,” says Marx. Shakthivel runs a stitching section with seven labourers including his wife. The supplier provides him with cut cloth, and the cloth runs through five machines to emerge as a fancy top. “Just my type” declares a fair-skinned girl gazing out of a fuchsia printed top, on the bundle just finished. Only two days ago, Shakthivel had asked three of his workers not to come. “I only have old cash. And no fresh orders had come, and there were serpentine queues in the bank.” He has to pay Rs.4,000 each to each of them. He plans to wind up the remaining work, and lock up the section for the rest of the week. The rent of Rs.6,000 for the stitching section and house rent of Rs.5,000, both due for the 10th, was not accepted with old cash. Bending down to gently pick up her two-year-old son asleep on a cut cloth on the floor, Shakthivel’s wife Swarnalatha asks him if they should go to Palani, to be with their relatives. Abu Baquar Siddique, Shakthivel’s chief tailor, is a man of quiet pride. He collects part of his weekly wages daily, the Rs.200 from Shakthivel every evening goes into buying 2 kilograms of rice for Rs.100 and other groceries for a fresh-cooked dinner for his family of four. On Wednesday, Shakthivel gave him Rs.500 of the old note to tide over. When the past week saw households running on credit, goodwill, trust and goodness of the local grocers, Siddique never kept an ‘account’ of credit with any grocer. “I never have before. That’ll push us to buy more, consume more.” So, when the outlet refused to accept his money, he simply migrated to PDS rice. But his two young boys are unable to eat the poor quality ration rice. Grinding to a halt

 These men (and women) are part of the garment supply chain that swells at the lowest end to include many interdependent household units. This chain train hinged on work orders from the small supplier, to a micro unit, to the last-mile household unit — until demonetisation stopped it in its tracks. Slowly, units are beginning to grind to a halt, threatening to snap this chain. Two domestic suppliers that supplied cloth to Shakthivel’s stitching section locked down this Monday. The same two suppliers had supplied cloth to 20 other units with workforce of 20 each. Between them, the two suppliers each had a workforce of 100-150 workers. “They have to pay me around Rs.20,000-Rs.30,000,” says Shakthivel. Small suppliers and dependent tiny units that look to the supplier for work are wary of piling up work commitments and resultant unpaid wages. On Wednesday, the South Indian Collar Shirt and Small Manufacturers Association (SISMA) passed a resolution to downscale from 15 shifts per worker per week to six shifts. “Units are already laying off non-salaried workers,” says K.S. Babuji, general secretary, SISMA. Eashwaramoorthy is a domestic supplier selling to buyers in Mumbai and Delhi. His unit with a 20-man workforce has now pared down to just three workers. The rest were asked not to come. “The current account withdrawal limit of Rs.50,000 is not allowed by banks here. How do we pay,” he asks. Demonetisation for the garment industry came at a time when the buyers were on the verge of settling payments of the suppliers for the Diwali despatches across the country. The buyers are now unable to make bank transfers to the suppliers beyond Rs.49,000, and that too only after the suppliers courier multiple copies of proof for bank verification. Tiruppur’s layered system

 The garment industry in Tiruppur is made of three types of units: exporters, merchant exporters who receive subcontract work from exporters, and domestic suppliers. Exports — a Rs.22,000-crore turnover business — are primarily cashless. Yet demonetisation has tangentially affected exporters because they have to engage peripherally with cash-based subcontracts for ‘job works’ such as knitting, buttoning, small servicing, printing, packing to merchant exporters. The merchant exporters themselves are small units with a workforce paid in cash. The cash crunch has halted 25 per cent of subcontracts commissioned by exporters, says T.R. Vijaya Kumar, general secretary, Tirupur Exporters’ Association (TEA), that has over 1,000 members. The exporters will have to deal with penalty of 20 per cent additional costs on shipments that will now be airlifted. It’s domestic suppliers who are facing the demonetisation heat the most. They include micro units and sections that are partly, largely or fully run on cash. The garment industry in Tiruppur has 8 lakh employees; 4 lakh in direct employment and another 4 lakh in subsidiary units such as knitting, dyeing, printing, embroidering, spinning, accessories. Of this, 20 per cent or 1.6 lakh workers are estimated to be unorganised workforce. There are 2,000 small, medium and tiny units — now facing the prospect of phased lockout — that provide work to this unorganised workforce. Early this year, the TEA had met the Prime Minister during his visit to Coimbatore to present a ‘Vision 2020’ document to him that envisages increasing the garment industry’s turnover to Rs.1 lakh crore by 2020. When demonetisation was announced, the exporters had cheered the decision. The TEA estimates the turnover of domestic units at Rs.7,000 crore from accounted transactions and another Rs.7,000 crore from cash transactions. On the other hand, the unorganised units solely run on cash are estimated to have a turnover of Rs.15,000 crore. For the exporters, this is a ‘parallel economy’ with a cumulative Rs.22,000-crore turnover. “This supply chain runs on cash, weeding out taxes. If this economy is integrated, then there will be a level playing field for all,” says Vijaya Kumar. Khaderpettai, Wednesday, 3.40 p.m.

 Jeganathan bears a distant look as he scans through a Tamil paper. He was making daily sales worth Rs.10,000-Rs.30,000 on average out of his 80-sq.-feet shop, stacked with bundles of trackpants, T-shirts of all hues. On Monday, he sent away the only daily wager he had. “Yesterday, I downed the shutter by 4 p.m.,” he says. Not a single sale on Wednesday in the shop he co-owns with his brother. Khaderpettai market represents that parallel economy that Vijaya Kumar was talking about. It has over 3,000 shops, wholesale and retail and godowns, run solely on cash transactions. Khaderpettai lends the retail-end support for the domestic garment suppliers. They lend the rationale for business for the smaller manufacturing units, whose manufacturing orders hinge largely on the business vibrancy of Khaderpettai. Some of the garment godowns are straight extensions of the manufacturing units. The hustle of Khaderpettai is missing since the demonetisation. Many believe things would look up once money circulation picked up. The garment industry has a high labour demand. Attrition rate is 50 per cent, and the average labour shortage is 35 per cent. There is a general resistance both among labourers and domestic units to crediting wages through banks. Wage account entails Employees’ State Insurance and Provident Fund contribution from both ends. Labourers, with marginal wages, are not enthused at the prospect of deduction, and employers are equally unwilling to contribute. Demonetisation has struck at the heart of this cash mode of payment of wages. Hence, ever since demonetisation, a primarily contractual workforce is migrating from smaller domestic units to export units, which credit salary through wage accounts. But the ability of smaller export units to absorb this preliminary flight of labour will unfold only in the coming days. Also, export units may not fully be insulated as the chain involves cash-based merchant exporters too. Small is no longer beautiful

 Exporters also view demonetisation as a prelude to the nationwide rollout of the Goods and Services Tax (GST), as a move to bring everything into accounting, force small units to migrate to wage accounts. “Once GST comes into operation in April, there will less opposition and easy integration,” predicts Vijaya Kumar. But on the ground, there is another reality being played out. The experience of micro units and sections so far indicate a possible immiserisation of owners and workers. While labourers just may have the option of flitting to an export unit wherever possible, marginal units such as Shaktivel’s stitching section or the yarn-knitting unit of Venkatachalam don’t have that option. At worst, they will have to close down and move into the labour market themselves. Forty years ago, Vijaya Kumar’s father had started out with 10 workers and 10 machines. Today, he runs an export business with 1,500 workers. “If this had come then, my father would not have survived,” he agrees. This churn will decimate small units, which are unable to migrate, have no means or know-how to systemise their business operations. This slowly would also mean that businesses can henceforth be run only by the educated, who can engage tax accountants, auditors, and dedicated personnel for documentation. “Today’s tiny units are tomorrow’s larger units. This will also mean nipping start-ups in the bud,” concedes Vijaya Kumar. Pointing at three shuttered shops in a Khaderpettai lane, a man, who refuses to disclose his name, says that almost all shops have sent away their daily wage workers. Until last week, each shop had a Hindi-speaking worker to help negotiate with buyers from beyond the Vindhyas. “Do you see knitwear in the street shops of Chennai, Mumbai, and Delhi? They are from here. The garment units are showroom; we, Khaderpettai, are for the pavement. The poor buy from us,” he says. “We all started off lifting loads on our back and have come to own businesses. We are not educated.” Printable version | Jan 7, 2017 1:24:44 AM | http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/The-warp-and-woof-of-demonetisation/article16667604.ece © The Hindu A few days after Ms. Jayalalithaa’s death, wall posters began to appear all over Chennai and in parts of Tamil Nadu projecting Sasikala as the next-in-line leader in the AIADMK V.K.

  Hundreds of Indian Youth Congress workers on Friday protested against the difficulties being faced by the public as a result of the government’s decision to withdraw Rs.500 and Rs.1,000 notes from circulation. Marching from the IYC headquarters on Raisina Road towards Parliament, the Youth Congress workers protested against the way the demonetisation was executed after Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s surprise announcement on November 8. Speaking at the protest, Congress Rajya Sabha MP Anand Sharma said: “The BJP government doesn’t have any plan for execution of demonetisation.” He added that the government had first said there was sufficient currency, but then it decreased the amount of cash that could be exchanged at banks from Rs.4,500 to Rs.2,000 per person. IYC national president Amrinder Singh Raja said the Prime Minister should be held responsible for the deaths of 47 people, who have died either while waiting in line at banks or as result of demonetisation.

| Photo Credit: R_Ragu Apprehending “riots,” the Supreme Court on Friday refused the government’s plea to stay cases filed against inconveniences caused by demonetisation in High Courts and lower courts across the country, saying, “How can we shut our doors to people when there is an issue of such magnitude.” Noting that people have started becoming “frantic” for money, braving queues for hours, a Bench led by Chief Justice of India T.S. Thakur observed that the very fact that cases are being filed in courts all over is a signal that the problem is “serious and of magnitude.” “They are going to the courts for relief. We cannot shut our doors to the people,” Chief Justice Thakur said, refusing the government’s plea. The Bench, however, said the government could file transfer petitions to shift all the cases filed in other courts to Delhi. “This is very serious. This will require great consideration. People have become frantic, people are affected... There may be riots,” the Bench, also comprising Justice Anil R. Dave, told Attorney-General Mukul Rohatgi. “That is completely wrong. People are patiently standing in lines,” Mr. Rohatgi protested. ""There is suffering. There is difficulty and you cannot dispute that,"" Chief Justice Thakur observed. Senior advocate Kapil Sibal submitted that 47 people had died post November 8, as an after effect of the demonetisation. ""Would we be issuing notifications by the day, by the hour, if we were not concerned about the people's problems? The length of the lines is reducing by the day,"" Mr. Rohatgi claimed. Chief Justice Thakur asked why the government has a problem in dispensing enough cash. ""Tell us, is there any deficiency in Rs. 100 notes? They have not been demonetised. Why are they not been made available at least?"" the Chief Justice asked. The government acknowledged that there was a shortage of Rs.100 notes as the now defunct Rs. 500 and Rs. 1000 notes had formed 80 per cent of the currency in circulation before November 8. “Rs. 100 notes are not available as Rs. 500 and Rs. 1000 notes was over 80 per cent of the currency,” Mr. Rohatgi submitted. But the Attorney-General, in the same breath, said denied any “cash crunch”. He submitted that there was only trouble dispatching the newly printed currency all over the country — to post offices, ATMs, banks, etc. Chief Justice Thakur asked why the government chose to reduce the limit of exchange of currency notes from Rs. 4500 to Rs. 2000 despite the Supreme Court asking the Centre to do its best to alleviate the hardship of the common man. Mr. Rohatgi replied that debit cards could be swiped for cash at petrol bunks. and a withdrawal limit of Rs. 2.5 lakh has been allowed for wedding purposes. Besides, farmers would get Rs. 50000. Mr. Sibal said, “People with Mercedes can afford to swipe their cards at petrol bunks, not farmers. And many who line up are illiterate...A family walked 20 km from Bastar to an ICICI bank branch,” he said. Mr. Sibal said 23 lakh crore notes have to be printed and Rs. 14 lakh crore worth currency was frozen as from November 8. Mr. Rohatgi at this point directed the government's attack on Mr. Sibal, accusing him of attempting politics in court. “I saw your press conference,” Mr. Rohatgi told Mr. Sibal. “Was my press conference held in court? Then why are you bringing it here?” Mr. Sibal countered. The Bench has asked both the Centre and Mr. Sibal to produce facts and figures on November 25, depicting the ground realities and sufferings caused to the people due to demonetisation. The apex court had on November 15 refused to stay the government’s demonetisation notification, but asked it to spell out the steps taken to minimise public inconvenience. Out of the four PILs in the apex court on the demonetisation issue, two were filed by Delhi-based lawyers Vivek Narayan Sharma and Sangam Lal Pandey, while two others were filed by individuals, S Muthukumar and Adil Alvi. The petitioners have alleged that the sudden decision has created chaos and harassment to the public at large and the notification of the Department of Economic Affairs, Ministry of Finance be either quashed or deferred for some time.

484,2016-11-19,12.0,"No demonetisation threat to voter turnout, say Dravidian majors","With people queuing up outside banks and ATMs to source legal tender, one question that emerges in the three Assembly constituencies that go to the polls on Saturday is whether this would impact the voter turnout. A section of observers and leaders of the two Dravidian parties – the AIADMK and the DMK – feel that the turnout of voters will remain unaffected by the crisis triggered by demonetisation. Though the entire Tamil Nadu, like the rest of the country, has been witness to tales of hardship of people either trying to withdraw money from their accounts or exchange the demonetised notes for fresh notes, it will not come in the way of a large number of electors in the three constituencies – Thanjavur, Aravakurichi and Thiruparankundram – turning up on the election day, the parties say. In terms of popular perception, the poll for the Aravakurichi and Thanjavur constituencies is viewed more as a by-poll though election to these seats was scrapped in May this year in the wake of allegations of large-scale bribing of voters. In recent years, especially in the last 10 years, high voter turnout in by-elections has become the norm in the State. Of the 18 by-polls held since October 2006, on five occasions, the turnout exceeded the 80 per cent mark, and on eight occasions, it was in the range of 70 per cent to 79 per cent. In four occasions, the poll percentage varied from 60 per cent to 69 per cent, and only once, it was less than 60 per cent. Even in the general elections, either to the Lok Sabha or to the Assembly, the turnout has been above 70 per cent. In the 2009 and 2014 Lok Sabha polls, the figures were 73.05 per cent and 73.74 per cent, respectively. Similarly, the 2011 and 2016 Assembly elections saw 78.29 per cent and 74.26 per cent turnout. The 2011 figure remains an all-time high for the Assembly polls. Discussing voter behaviour, observers and representatives of the two parties cite political mobilisation as the primary factor for their optimism. Both K.N. Nehru, the DMK’s coordinator for Thanjavur and a seasoned AIADMK Minister looking after Thiruparankundram who requested anonymity, emphasise that the campaign by their parties was quite intensive in the last two weeks.

485,2016-11-19,12.0,Plan to airlift currency notes to remote areas,"The Maharashtra government along with the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has put in place a contingency plan to ferry currency notes to remote areas through a helicopter. At a meeting between RBI officials and the State government, it was decided to shortlist remote regions for the plan, including Gadchiroli, Chandrapur, Gondia and Bhandara, senior officials who attended the meeting told The Hindu. The plan will be put in place in case credit cooperative societies and district central cooperative banks run out of cash in remote and rural regions. Other commercial banks which can reach out to the remote areas do not have many branches. District banks not having enough cash could hit the currency availability. “The plan was discussed between Finance Minister Sudhir Mungantiwar, who is heading a Cabinet sub-committee on demonetisation, and RBI officials this week.

486,2016-11-19,12.0,?Currency crisis could sound death knell for co-op institutions?,"The crisis triggered by the ongoing demonetisation drive could potentially make all co-operative banking institutions in Tamil Nadu defunct in the next 10 to 20 days unless urgent steps are taken to address certain issues being faced by them, a top official told the Madras High Court on Friday. The Joint Registrar of Co-operative Societies and Managing Director of the District Central Co-operative Bank (DCCB), Villupuram, through a counter affidavit in a case related to demonetisation, submitted that due to the withdrawal of the two high denomination currency, the district banks and their affiliated primary agricultural co-operative societies are unable to lend loans to several lakh farmers. “If this situation continues for another 10-20 days, the entire network of co-operative institutions would become defunct,” he added. In Villupuram district alone, 239 primary agricultural cooperative societies with 18 lakhs members, 57 Employees Co-operative Thrift and Credit Societies with 22,085 members and five co-operative marketing societies with 38,877 members and other affiliated societies had been put to financial hardship from November 10 onwards, he added. Explaining the situation at the State-level, he said, “All over Tamil Nadu, a total of 23 such DCCBs, their branches and around 4,500 affiliated primary agricultural cooperative societies, and around 2,000 employees of co-operative credit societies have been put to financial hardship.” Noting that the farming season is at its peak only during the ongoing north-east monsoon, the officer said that denial of credit facilities to farmers through primary agricultural co-operative societies amounted to denial of their legitimate right to crop loans. Against this background, the official wanted the court to permit DCCBs and Primary Agricultural Co-operative Credit Societies (PACCS) to accept demonetised notes of Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,000 from borrowers against their loans.

487,2016-11-19,12.0,TNCC to protest demonetisation outside nationalised banks,"Criticising Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s decision to withdraw currency notes of Rs. 1,000 and Rs. 500 denominations, the Tamil Nadu Congress Committee said on Friday said that it would hold protests outside nationalised banks on November 21. In a statement, TNCC president Su. Thirunavukkarasar said that the order had been implemented without any planning by the Central government. Despite repeated revisions in upper limit for banking transactions, the exemptions offered by the government will not be sufficient for a family to conduct a wedding, for which a withdrawal limit of Rs. 2.5 lakh has been set as a sovereign of gold costs over Rs. 22,000. Mr. Thirunavukkarasar also blamed the Tamil Nadu government saying that it had not taken adequate steps to help farmers who felt “cheated” by the demonetisation. The restrictions placed on cooperative banks had stagnated the agricultural economy. Mr. Thirunavukkarasar also raised politician and mining baron Janardhana Reddy’s daughter’s wedding saying that the Centre should check which bank had released Rs. 650 crore allegedly spent by Mr. Reddy for the wedding ceremony. Tamil Maanila Congress president G.K. Vasan on Friday announced that his party would hold a protest next week against the Centre for its “lack of preparedness” as regards the demonetisation issue. The move is a shift from the position adopted by the TMC after the Prime Minister announced his decision. Mr. Vasan’s first reaction was one of support as he termed the move as one against black money. Later, he began noting that people had been inconvenienced by the move and appealed to the Centre to ensure that people’s lives are not affected. On Friday, in a strongly-worded statement, Mr. Vasan noted that trade had come to a standstill. He said that long queues could be seen outside banks and people living in rural areas had to travel long distances to ATMs and banks. Mr. Vasan also noted that there was scrutiny on the use of indelible ink with the Election Commission writing to the Finance Ministry about a possible impediment during the upcoming elections. The TMC leader said that he would lead his party’s protest in Chennai on November 23.

488,2016-11-19,12.0,"Anger, frustration as currency crisis persists","The situation on the currency front continues to be grim and the anger and frustration among the commoners and the salaried class is palpable in different parts of the State as the crisis drags on without any sign of immediate improvement. Interactions with different sections of the population in various districts by The Hindu reporters show that demonetisation is continuing to wreak havoc in the lives of ordinary people, especially in the context of the Reserve Bank of India’s restrictions on cooperative banks and credit societies in participating in the currency-exchange exercise. Businesses have suffered a blow, workers in the small scale sector and traditional industries have been left without prompt wage payments and, in general, people with immediate requirement of money have been left borrowing from whomsoever they could tap. On the streets of Thiruvananthapuram, sales have plummeted by roughly half of what they used to be before November 8. Those running small eateries and restaurants spoke of a 50-60 per cent fall in business. “We are keeping the show going only because we do not want to lose the workers we now have. We are paying their wages from our pocket,” said a restaurateur close to the international airport. Apparel stitching centres, in particular, are in a fix, as customers are not turning up to collect finished items. George, a tailor at Saphalyam Complex, Palayam, says that his customers owe him up to Rs.10,000. His savings are running low, and there is nobody to borrow from, given the cash crunch. “I might soon go hungry, unless I resort to stealing,” he says. In Kannur, discontent is evident over a large spectrum. “Today I got only one phone call till noon, while normally I get 25 to 30 calls by 11 a.m. everyday,” said Mohammed Sunil, a businessman in Kannur. The crisis is also forcing people to hold on to whatever little small denomination currency notes they have. “It is becoming quite a hassle,” said Heera Krishnan, a resident at an apartment at Kannookara in Kannur and secretary of an apartment owners’ association. She said she paid the salary to the security staff in cheque and the weekly wages for workers of the apartment complex with currency of Rs. 20 denomination. For ordinary people, it is not so much the shortage of cash but shortage of currency of Rs. 100, and lower that has made life distressing. “The ATMs in Kannur town have only currency of Rs. 2,000 and so I abandoned my attempt to withdraw money yesterday,” said T. Gafoor, a carpenter. For a small carpentry work he did the other day, he was offered a cheque because the household where he did the work has only a few notes of Rs. 2,000 denomination. Workers of a major private plantation in the eastern parts of Kollam, near Thenmala, refused to accept weekly wages last week when the management brought Rs. 35 lakh in the scrapped denomination notes. The workers wanted the management to disclose the source of the cash or make arrangements with a bank to exchange the notes. The management failed to meet the demand and the workers, numbering around 500, have been forced to go without their wages for a week. In Kochi, long queues before bank branches and ATMs have become the norm with weary and, as a result, angry people waiting for their turn. The availability of bills of Rs. 100 at some ATMs was in stark contrast to the ubiquity of the Rs 2,000 bill at bank branches. Noticeably, the day also marked the receding stock of Rs. 20 and Rs. 10 notes, though soiled, while Rs. 50 bills remained largely unseen. “It’s getting tougher by the day with no solution in sight. There are rumours that a tranche of new Rs.500 note, worth Rs. 5 crore, is reaching the RBI regional office in Thiruvananthapuram, but that may not be sufficient to meet the demand,” says C.D. Josson, State general secretary of the All India Bank Employees Federation. Demonetisation has brought life to a virtual paralysis in the Malabar region. In the urban and semi-urban centres, the increased cash flow seemed to be easing the pressure on banks and thinning people’s queue at banks and ATMs. But the Centre’s decision to slash the amount that can be withdrawn from Rs. 4,500 to Rs. 2,000 has once again increased the demand for cash and added to the length of queues at banks. A large number of ATMs have run dry. In the rural areas, the rationing system has been hit and farmers are at their wits’ end trying to find money to meet their immediate needs. Jaya at Thirur in Thrissur, who ekes out a living ironing clothes, and Sukumaran, who runs a TV and computer repair shop, are faced with similar plight, with little income coming their way. “I haven’t received a single piece of cloth for ironing last week,” said Jaya. Shravan Paul, a young entrepreneur, laments that he has to stand in the queue with identity card for hours for each bank transaction. “Projects are getting postponed and payments getting delayed. We are forced to keep running projects on hold and thanks to curbs on withdrawal of money form banks, we are not able to pay wages for workers,” he says. Disillusionment is beginning to engulf many in Malappuram as only three of the 16 ATMs in the town functioned on Friday. Serpentine queues were seen outside the ATMs. A man was seen in tears at a leading bank branch on finding that the bank is not in a position to give him cash for his daughter’s marriage. He had a few lakhs of rupees in his account, yet could not withdraw the cash he needed for the marriage. “It is pathetic,” fumed poet Manambur Rajanbabu. People are resorting to cheque payments for bulk purchases as has been experience of G. Sreekumar, who runs a hardware shop on the outskirts of Thiruvalla town. He had to take cheques worth Rs. 1.5 lakh on Thursday while the cash received at the shop on the day was only about Rs 14,000. The State Bank of India that received a large infusion of notes on Wednesday to be pumped into its Kerala branches and ATMs found smaller-denomination notes less in quantity. The SBI received from the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) Rs.406 crore worth of fresh notes, to the relief of the bank’s staff. But, against their expectations, the cache included only a small quantum of smaller notes — only Rs.9 crore worth of 100s, 50s and 20s.

  Traders affiliated to Tamil Nadu Vanigar Sangankalin Peravai have condemned the Central government for demonetising Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,000 currency notes. A group of traders of the forum who staged a demonstration in the city on Friday charged the Central government of trying to destroy retail traders who had been serving the common people through the demonetisation. It had severely hit the retail trade. If the general public was facing hardship on the one hand to buy even essential commodities, retail traders were facing difficulty in selling their stock, the protestors said. If the government had identified and imprisoned black money holders, gangs involved in circulation of fake currency notes, bank loan defaulters, those depositing their ill-gotten wealth in banks abroad and corrupt politicians, the culture of black money and fake currency could have been wiped out. Should the common man and traders be punished for the inefficiency of officials and those in governance, the protestors said. The Central government had announced this decision with the intention that business should not take place in the shops of retail traders. The Congress and the Bharatiya Janata Party were competing to protect foreign trade and destroy domestic trade, they said. Claiming that the present action of the Central government would not control black money, the protestors said the hidden agenda of the government was to make the common man buy products through online and in malls. The demonstration was led by Sivasakthi Ramanathan, Tiruchi north district president of Tamil Nadu Vanigar Sangankalin Peravai.

The Mayor, in the official resolution, said that the Prime Minister’s announcement of demonetisation was a declaration of war on the common people in the garb of fighting black money.

493,2016-11-19,12.0,Demonetisation hits rural farmers hard,"In an attempt to overcome demonetisation challenges, rural merchants in the district are still depending on old currency notes as a last resort to pay farmers who are in need of liquid cash. While a few are trying to run the show by partly releasing money to their regulars, majority are still clueless about tiding over the challenge in the changing circumstances. Binu Abraham, a rural farmer, reveals that old currency notes are still in use in many locations as a short-term arrangement to manage the crisis with the mutual consent of sellers and buyers. “In emergency cases, farmers familiar with local traders accept old currency notes and get them exchanged at various banks later,” he adds. George Thottathil, a farmer from Koodaranhi, says: “There are around 10 shops in the Koodaranhi and Koombara regions alone, but none of them makes full payment to their clients owing to shortage of currency notes. Small-scale rubber growers are the worst hit even as their well-off counterparts somehow handle the crisis by granting more time to local traders to clear arrears.” Mr. George also points out that local agriculturists are facing a huge crisis owing to the closure of some rural shops as a result of shortage of currency notes. “We can’t blame merchants alone as they have been depending on the conventional style of trading with liquid cash for decades,” he adds. P. Saji, a rubber merchant from Thiruvambadi, says only a few farmers in his area know how to use credit and debit cards as they have been meeting daily expenses using liquid cash. “The sudden withdrawal of high-value currency notes has literally shaken them and doubled their turmoil,” he adds. K. Johnson, a farmer and office-bearer of a newly formed farmer body at Koombara, says he is also among the several hundreds of frustrated settler farmers who are yet to get the money for the produce they have sold in the open market. The experience is not any different for coconut farmers. They say the continuing reluctance of small- and large-scale traders to take the stock for more than a week is ultimately fuelling the whole crisis.

494,2016-11-19,12.0,?Currency crisis could sound death knell for co-op units?,"The crisis triggered by the ongoing demonetisation drive could potentially make all co-operative banking institutions in Tamil Nadu defunct in the next 10 to 20 days unless urgent steps are taken to address certain issues being faced by them, a top official told the Madras High Court on Friday. The Joint Registrar of Co-operative Societies and Managing Director of the District Central Co-operative Bank (DCCB), Villupuram, through a counter affidavit in a case related to demonetisation, submitted that due to the withdrawal of the two high denomination currency, the district banks and their affiliated primary agricultural co-operative societies are unable to lend loans to several lakh farmers. “If this situation continues for another 10-20 days, the entire network of co-operative institutions would become defunct,” he added. In Villupuram district alone, 239 primary agricultural cooperative societies with 18 lakhs members, 57 Employees Co-operative Thrift and Credit Societies with 22,085 members and five co-operative marketing societies with 38,877 members and other affiliated societies had been put to financial hardship from November 10 onwards, he added. Explaining the situation at the State-level, he said, “All over Tamil Nadu, a total of 23 such DCCBs, their branches and around 4,500 affiliated primary agricultural cooperative societies, and around 2,000 employees of co-operative credit societies have been put to financial hardship.” Noting that the farming season is at its peak only during the ongoing north-east monsoon, the officer said that denial of credit facilities to farmers through primary agricultural co-operative societies amounted to denial of their legitimate right to crop loans. Against this background, the official wanted the court to permit DCCBs and Primary Agricultural Co-operative Credit Societies (PACCS) to accept demonetised notes of Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,000 from borrowers against their loans. He also wanted removal of the Rs. 24,000 per week per account limit, and staying of the operation of the RBI circulars in this regard. Justice N.

At an awareness programme organised by the Bharatiya Janata Party, here on Friday, Institute of Chartered Accounts of India (ICAI) Karimnagar chapter chairman D. Niranjana Chary hailed the bold decision of the Union Government. He said the demonetisation would check terrorism and hoarding of unaccounted money. Allaying fears among the people, he said that they would not face any problem in banking transactions with their legal money. He said that presenting the PAN card number was mandatory in the banking system if a customer withdraws more than Rs. 50,000. The institute office-bearers K. Venkateshwarlu, G. Anand Kumar, N. Varaprasad, Y. Anil Kumar, K. Rammohan, BJP official spokesperson Bandi Sanjay Kumar and others participated in the programme. They said that the demonetisation would help reduce prices in the real-estate sector and there would be no registrations of properties under fictitious names. It would also have an impact on the fee of management-quota seats in professional colleges. They also said that people would be habituated to do more banking transactions and there would be more deposits in the banks helping the bankers in providing more loans at lower interest rates. They also clarified that the CAs would only tell the people on how to manage taxes and help the Government get its revenue.

  Some had packed up and left, while others wound down the clock by taking a walk or chatting over a cup of tea. Touts at the usually buzzing complex that houses the Regional Transport Office, the Sub-Registrar’s office and an Indian Railways reservation centre in Noida’s Sector 33 were simply waiting and watching on Thursday. Business down by 80% Since the government withdrew Rs.500 and Rs.1,000 notes, the subsequent liquidity crunch has hit business for touts, who rely on small cash payments. For the 150-odd touts outside the Noida complex, about 80 per cent of business had evaporated in the week since Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s demonetisation announcement. Govind, who calls himself an “advisor” on all things related to RTO, said that not only was work down, but some clients were still trying to use the old currency notes. Turning away clients Another RTO tout, Kunal Verma (name changed), said he had seen only two customers on Thursday, down from the average 10 he would get before the cash crunch. “I had to turn those two away as they did not have money,” he said. Ravi Agarwal, a stamp paper vendor, said he was left with barely 20 per cent of the daily business he would get on an ordinary day. “Even though our work is suffering, this is a good move. It is affecting the common people right now, but if black money is removed, it is worth it,” he said. As the touts wait for business, the transport, registrar and railway offices themselves have seen the usually long queues shrink. The scene was similar at a Passport Seva Kendra at Delhi’s Herald House. Usually busy, there appeared to be no rush outside the passport office on Thursday. According to Rama Nath Jha, executive director of Transparency International India, this was because the “delivery of services” had been hit. He added that once cash flow is restored and services bounce back, so would petty corruption as the demand for quick access to services would increase. Need more tax reforms “Petty corruption will not be affected in the long-run. But, demonetisation of high-value currency notes in circulation is a conventional method to curb corruption,” said Mr. Jha. However, he did say that long-lasting change would only happen if the ongoing “note wapsi ” was followed by “strong anti-corruption laws, tax reforms, digitisation of property transfer and more use of technology in governance.” Experts say that strong anti-corruption laws must follow to ensure long-lasting change Printable version | Jan 7, 2017 1:25:12 AM | http://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/Currency-ban-effect-petty-corruption-down/article16668211.ece © The Hindu The Hindu revisits the gruesome December 2012 gang-rape to examine if Delhi is any safer for the average woman today"

There are 34 branches of the District Central Cooperative Bank operating in Vellore district. “We were accepting the two notes for exchange and as deposits from customers since the announcement for demonetising the two notes was made. But we stopped accepting the two currencies after the notification from the RBI. This has affected the bank customers to a large extent,” he said. The bank has nearly two lakh customers in the district, with its branches in rural areas having a majority of farmers as customers. “As we are not accepting the two notes, inconvenience is caused to customers and they are saying they will close the accounts,” he added.

Indiran, a visitor from Malaysia, who had come down to shop for a wedding in the family and visit temples in Manthralayam and Tirupati, said as far as stay was concerned, there was no problem since they could pay by card. “But it is a problem when one has to pay for the taxi or buy puja items for the temples. I had to borrow some cash from a few friends in Chennai,” he said. Some hoteliers said they were still accepting Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,000 notes from customers who were unable to change them. “For the first few days, there was no cash with money changers, so we had to help them. They are not able to change for more than Rs. 5,000, given the ceiling on exchange. That is hardly enough for the kind of spending that many of them like to do when they are here,” a city hotelier said. In some places where banks and forex counters were not helping tourists, they were forced to approach touts to get their notes exchanged, a travel operator said. N. Nageswaran, secretary general, All India Association of Authorized Money Changers and Money Transfer Agents, said in the first few days, there was a problem of currency not being available in money exchange counters. “We directed the consumers to the banks that had money. But the situation has eased since we have been allowed to draw from banks. There is no doubt that there are hitches still, but we have asked our members to interact with banks and help our customers,” he said.

500,2016-11-19,12.0,Trust in the time of demonetisation,"Many years ago, a man called Francis Fukuyama proposed an economic theory that rested on trust. He argued that economic development would be based on the amount of trust each society displayed in non-kin relationships. In his 1996 publication, Trust , he said: “One of the most important lessons we can learn from an examination of economic life is that a nation’s well being, as well as its ability to compete, is conditioned by a single, pervasive cultural characteristic: the level of trust inherent in the society.” This past week, we’ve probably come out with flying colours in Fukuyama test. Since demonetisation reduced liquidity in the market, with limited sectors accepting Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,000 notes as legal tender, and the insufficiency of notes to replace the currency, this society has moved on, thanks largely to trust. At a micro level, people, traders and vendors who are used to cash transactions on a daily basis, sought refuge in credit and trust, hoping the tide would turn again. For autorickshaw drivers, watercan suppliers, milkmen, tea shops and small roadside eateries with their loyal clientele, it was easy to slip into credit mode. Vanessa Peter, who often takes autorickshaws to commute to work, found it was exactly this which came to her rescue when she hailed an auto at the stand near her house in Kodambakkam, after the demonetisation drive left her short of change. It is not all profit for Samivelu, a water bubble-top supplier in Madipakkam. He said all his customers had promptly made payments all these days, and he felt that water being an essential commodity, it was his duty to ensure they got the water, even if he had to supply it all on credit. In Coimbatore, several builders have requested the grocery outlets and tea stalls near their construction sites to give products on credit to their workers. With a shortage in the availability of cash to pay weekly wages for the workers, they have only paid an advance amount to these workers. Dhanalakshmi, who has rented out two houses to workers, says her tenants were unable to pay the rent. “How can I ask them when they have not received their wages properly? I know they will pay up when they get money,” she says. At Gandhi Market in Tiruchi, a major wholesale and retail market for the region, many traders have been extending credit lines over the past week. Not strictly due to generosity, but also out of necessity. “Seventy per cent of our business has been affected after demonetisation. Many of us are operating on credit transactions,” said A. Thangaraj, general secretary, Tiruchi Onion Commission Mandi Traders’ Association. “Retail traders who purchase onions from us say they will pay after selling the produce. We realise their position and allow them to take the stocks on credit. We know we may have to wait for even up to a month to get the money,” he said. The same with suppliers. J. Madhavan, who runs a stationery shop in Madurai, said the daily sale of school and college notebooks and accounts books used to be around Rs. 25,000 a day but had plummeted to Rs. 2,000 a day since the announcement. Regular customers like representatives of educational institutions, who used to seek only discounts on notebooks, were now seeking credit for want of currency notes. He had no option but to oblige. Petty shopkeepers too say that sales on credit are on the rise. There’s also trust from the other side. There are regular customers who pay up tea stalls and vegetable vendors larger notes and ask them to hold the change against future purchases. A bakery owner from Salem says he sells goods on credit only to known customers, and politely turns away others. T. Arunkumar, an advocate at the Madras High Court, said stamp vendors from whom he regularly purchased stamp papers were now lending them on credit. ( With inputs from Dennis S. Jesudasan, K.

Banks are providing drinking water and temporary shelter to customers, acknowledging their plight.— Photo: K.K. Mustafah
  The situation on the currency front continues to be grim and the anger and frustration among the commoners and the salaried class is palpable in different parts of the State as the crisis drags on without any sign of immediate improvement. Interactions with different sections of the population in various districts by The Hindu reporters show that demonetisation is continuing to wreak havoc in the lives of ordinary people, especially in the context of the Reserve Bank of India’s restrictions on cooperative banks and credit societies in participating in the currency-exchange exercise. Businesses have suffered a blow, workers in the small scale sector and traditional industries have been left without prompt wage payments and, in general, people with immediate requirement of money have been left borrowing from whomsoever they could tap. Thiruvananthapuram On the streets of Thiruvananthapuram, sales have plummeted by roughly half of what they used to be before November 8. Those running small eateries and restaurants spoke of a 50-60 per cent fall in business. “We are keeping the show going only because we do not want to lose the workers we now have. We are paying their wages from our pocket,” said a restaurateur close to the international airport. Apparel stitching centres, in particular, are in a fix, as customers are not turning up to collect finished items. George, a tailor at Saphalyam Complex, Palayam, says that his customers owe him up to Rs.10,000. His savings are running low, and there is nobody to borrow from, given the cash crunch. “I might soon go hungry, unless I resort to stealing,” he says. Kannur In Kannur, discontent is evident over a large spectrum. “Today I got only one phone call till noon, while normally I get 25 to 30 calls by 11 a.m. everyday,” said Mohammed Sunil, a businessman in Kannur. The crisis is also forcing people to hold on to whatever little small denomination currency notes they have. “It is becoming quite a hassle,” said Heera Krishnan, a resident at an apartment at Kannookara in Kannur and secretary of an apartment owners’ association. She said she paid the salary to the security staff in cheque and the weekly wages for workers of the apartment complex with currency of Rs. 20 denomination. For ordinary people, it is not so much the shortage of cash but shortage of currency of Rs. 100, and lower that has made life distressing. “The ATMs in Kannur town have only currency of Rs. 2,000 and so I abandoned my attempt to withdraw money yesterday,” said T. Gafoor, a carpenter. For a small carpentry work he did the other day, he was offered a cheque because the household where he did the work has only a few notes of Rs. 2,000 denomination. Kollam Workers of a major private plantation in the eastern parts of Kollam, near Thenmala, refused to accept weekly wages last week when the management brought Rs. 35 lakh in the scrapped denomination notes. The workers wanted the management to disclose the source of the cash or make arrangements with a bank to exchange the notes. The management failed to meet the demand and the workers, numbering around 500, have been forced to go without their wages for a week. Kochi In Kochi, long queues before bank branches and ATMs have become the norm with weary and, as a result, angry people waiting for their turn. The availability of bills of Rs. 100 at some ATMs was in stark contrast to the ubiquity of the Rs 2,000 bill at bank branches. Noticeably, the day also marked the receding stock of Rs. 20 and Rs. 10 notes, though soiled, while Rs. 50 bills remained largely unseen. “It’s getting tougher by the day with no solution in sight. There are rumours that a tranche of new Rs.500 note, worth Rs. 5 crore, is reaching the RBI regional office in Thiruvananthapuram, but that may not be sufficient to meet the demand,” says C.D. Josson, State general secretary of the All India Bank Employees Federation. In Malabar Demonetisation has brought life to a virtual paralysis in the Malabar region. In the urban and semi-urban centres, the increased cash flow seemed to be easing the pressure on banks and thinning people’s queue at banks and ATMs. But the Centre’s decision to slash the amount that can be withdrawn from Rs. 4,500 to Rs. 2,000 has once again increased the demand for cash and added to the length of queues at banks. A large number of ATMs have run dry. In the rural areas, the rationing system has been hit and farmers are at their wits’ end trying to find money to meet their immediate needs. Thrissur Jaya at Thirur in Thrissur, who ekes out a living ironing clothes, and Sukumaran, who runs a TV and computer repair shop, are faced with similar plight, with little income coming their way. “I haven’t received a single piece of cloth for ironing last week,” said Jaya. Shravan Paul, a young entrepreneur, laments that he has to stand in the queue with identity card for hours for each bank transaction. “Projects are getting postponed and payments getting delayed. We are forced to keep running projects on hold and thanks to curbs on withdrawal of money form banks, we are not able to pay wages for workers,” he says. Malappuram Disillusionment is beginning to engulf many in Malappuram as only three of the 16 ATMs in the town functioned on Friday. Serpentine queues were seen outside the ATMs. A man was seen in tears at a leading bank branch on finding that the bank is not in a position to give him cash for his daughter’s marriage. He had a few lakhs of rupees in his account, yet could not withdraw the cash he needed for the marriage. “It is pathetic,” fumed poet Manambur Rajanbabu. Pathanamthitta People are resorting to cheque payments for bulk purchases as has been experience of G. Sreekumar, who runs a hardware shop on the outskirts of Thiruvalla town. He had to take cheques worth Rs. 1.5 lakh on Thursday while the cash received at the shop on the day was only about Rs 14,000. Expectations belied The State Bank of India that received a large infusion of notes on Wednesday to be pumped into its Kerala branches and ATMs found smaller-denomination notes less in quantity. The SBI received from the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) Rs.406 crore worth of fresh notes, to the relief of the bank’s staff. But, against their expectations, the cache included only a small quantum of smaller notes — only Rs.9 crore worth of 100s, 50s and 20s.

502,2016-11-19,12.0,"No demonetisation threat to voter turnout, say Dravidian majors","With people queuing up outside banks and ATMs to source legal tender, one question that emerges in the three Assembly constituencies that go to the polls on Saturday is whether this would impact the voter turnout. A section of observers and leaders of the two Dravidian parties – the AIADMK and the DMK – feel that the turnout of voters will remain unaffected by the crisis triggered by demonetisation. Though the entire Tamil Nadu, like the rest of the country, has been witness to tales of hardship of people either trying to withdraw money from their accounts or exchange the demonetised notes for fresh notes, it will not come in the way of a large number of electors in the three constituencies – Thanjavur, Aravakurichi and Thiruparankundram – turning up on the election day, the parties say. In terms of popular perception, the poll for the Aravakurichi and Thanjavur constituencies is viewed more as a by-poll though election to these seats was scrapped in May this year in the wake of allegations of large-scale bribing of voters. In recent years, especially in the last 10 years, high voter turnout in by-elections has become the norm in the State. Of the 18 by-polls held since October 2006, on five occasions, the turnout exceeded the 80 per cent mark, and on eight occasions, it was in the range of 70 per cent to 79 per cent. In four occasions, the poll percentage varied from 60 per cent to 69 per cent, and only once, it was less than 60 per cent. Even in the general elections, either to the Lok Sabha or to the Assembly, the turnout has been above 70 per cent. In the 2009 and 2014 Lok Sabha polls, the figures were 73.05 per cent and 73.74 per cent, respectively. Similarly, the 2011 and 2016 Assembly elections saw 78.29 per cent and 74.26 per cent turnout. The 2011 figure remains an all-time high for the Assembly elections. Political mobilisation Discussing voter behaviour, observers and representatives of the two parties cite political mobilisation as the primary factor for their optimism. Both K.N. Nehru, the DMK’s coordinator for Thanjavur and a seasoned AIADMK Minister looking after Thiruparankundram who requested anonymity, emphasise that the campaign by their parties was quite intensive in the last two weeks. Apart from employing their senior leaders, the two parties had made their volunteers to “interact with electors frequently,” the representatives of the DMK and the AIADMK say. “This time, the turnout will be 80 per cent in all the three constituencies,” Mr. Nehru says, confidently. The campaign style of the two parties has prompted the Pattali Makkal Katchi to lodge a complaint with the Election Commission a few days ago, alleging widespread distribution of money. M.G. Devesahayam, a former civil servant and now an anti-corruption activist, says the present situation, arising out of demonetisation, has been cleverly used by the political parties, considering the fact that there is enough time left for the exchange of the demonetised notes. Giving a left-handed compliment, he describes the response of the parties as a mark of “their fantastic ingenuity.” G, Palanithurai, Chair for Panchayati Raj Studies, Department of Political Science and Development Administration of the Gandhigram Rural Institute, says the voters are also keenly watching how the two dominant parties are reacting to the demonetisation. R.S. Bharathi, DMK’s Rajya Sabha Member of Parliament, says that it is very likely that the people of the State would use the by-poll as an opportunity to express their resentment and anger over demonetisation, which in turn would result in increased turnout.

503,2016-11-19,12.0,Currency shortage continues,"While shortage of small change continued for the tenth day of demonetisation, crowds at banks started wearing thin for exchange of banned currency, more so because the limit was reduced to Rs.2,000 and a new trend of panic-stricken people repaying loans in haste emerged. “It doesn’t appear to be a good trend from the banks’ point of view, as it is going to adversely affect our loans portfolio. There’s no need to close your ‘performing’ loans in a jiffy,” a senior official with the State Bank of India (SBI) said on condition of anonymity. The SBI and its associates have about a hundred of their ATMs continuously loaded in and around the city with Rs.2,000 and Rs.100 currency notes. The branches, too, stacked small change brought from the treasury in Thriuvananthapuram. ATMs and branches in suburban Kochi continued to reel under pressure for want of adequate cash. The overall availability of currency, however, remained more or less the same as the past week but bank officials are hopeful that the arrival of fresh tranche of Rs.500 notes presumably on Monday would better the situation. A leading private bank frisked its employees and checked their baggage to ensure that they did not go out of their way to ‘help’ customers. People who could not find small change for their Rs.2,000 notes conducted transactions using ‘I owe you’ slips or bartering goods. Fuel stations, which the government said could be used to swipe cards to get currency of Rs.2,000, largely refused to do the same. “They refused to accept the Rs.2,000 note even if you bought petrol for Rs.500 unless you would take the balance in banned currency,” rued Sreejith, a motorist.

504,2016-11-19,12.0,District banks prone to fake currency: RBI,"The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has conveyed to the State government that 3,800 branches of the District Central Cooperative Banks (DCCBs) cannot be allowed to exchange demonetised currency because they are prone to hawala transactions and fake currency. The RBI pointed out to a State government delegation this week that several suspicious transactions in DCCBs in Uttar Pradesh have been reported, while banks continue to work in the absence of mechanisms to monitor fake currency. Under these circumstances, no chances can be taken in Maharashtra, the RBI said. Finance Minister Sudhir Mungantiwar confirmed to The Hindu that there remains a question mark on the monitoring mechanisms in DCCBs and the same has been conveyed by the RBI. The RBI has disallowed DCCBs to exchange old currency at a time when only 70 per cent of them are relying on the Real-time Gross Settlement System (RTGS) to transfer funds, and have little or no mechanisms, he said. “There are no means to check fake currency in these banks. The RBI has conveyed fear over weak monitoring systems in DCCBs,” Mr. Mungantiwar said. The DCCBs in Maharashtra have already moved court against the decision by the government and RBI to keep them under restrictions following demonitisation.

505,2016-11-19,12.0,Demonetisation effect: Jewellery trade scenario turns bleak,"A gold shop wears a deserted look in Ongole.—Photo: Kommuri Srinivas
  Gandhi Road, Ongole’s main jewellery market, sees thin crowds nowadays in the wake of scrapping of high-value notes by the Centre. The footfalls to gold shops has dropped to single digit from about 50 since the commencement of the marriage season since Diwali as a majority of sales are only through cash. Only some big corporate jewellery stores, which have come into existence of late in the city, still transact taking payments from customers either by way of cheque or plastic cards. People with stocks of scrapped notes make enquiries, but refrain from making any purchases. Many smaller players who cater to the needs of rural people are completely out of business, say some leading gold shop owners here. “We have been expecting a brisk sale for six months from now. But the demonetisation has put paid to our hopes,” laments Andhra Pradesh Gold Merchants Association state convener Thata Prasad in a conversation with The Hindu here. Only those with the dire need for purchasing gold for special occasions do so with either cheques or plastic cards, he explains. The silver lining for the jewellery industry is that people from now will feel safe putting their money on gold and precious stones than currency notes in the medium to long run, thanks to demonetisation. “In the short run, the bullion market likely to see a correction,” he opines, adding that “our business has come to almost standstill as we have stopped accepting scrapped Rs.500 and Rs. 1,000 rupee notes from November 8.” The jewellers had already lost business for three months following their protest against imposition of excise duty on gold and diamond jewellery by the Centre and making mandatory PAN card for purchases worth Rs.2 lakh, points out its Ongole unit vice-president V. Venkateswarlu. At least 60 per cent of the jewellery shops here will have to down the shutters once and for all if the Centre does not ensure replacement of notes expeditiously as almost 97 per cent of the business is done with cash as the industry is unorganised, laments its treasurer P. Ramesh Kumar. Expressing concern over the fall in business, Tata Goldplus branch manager Boyapati Naveen Chowdhary wants the Centre to enhance the credit limit for each day to up to Rs.5 lakh to enable customers purchase gold ornaments. “No big sale could be clinched since November 9. Only some small purchases like studs, ear rings, nose studs are made,” he adds.

Plan for execution Marching from the IYC headquarters on Raisina Road towards Parliament, the Youth Congress workers protested against the way the demonetisation was executed after Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s surprise announcement on November 8. Speaking at the protest, Congress Rajya Sabha MP Anand Sharma said: “The BJP government doesn’t have any plan for execution of demonetisation.” Deaths of 47 people He added that the government had first said there was sufficient currency, but then it decreased the amount of cash that could be exchanged at banks from Rs.4,500 to Rs.2,000 per person. IYC national president Amrinder Singh Raja said the Prime Minister should be held responsible for the deaths of 47 people, who have died either while waiting in line at banks or as result of demonetisation.

Muralidhar Rao has said. On the other hand, the highly extortionist practices of daily finance would be hit to some extent, he told reporters here on Friday. Describing demonetisation as the beginning of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s war against black economy, fulfilling the 2014 election mandate, he said it would bring down inflation very soon and curb speculation in gold and land. Consequently, their rates would come down, bringing them within the reach of the common people. ‘Historic step’ Describing demonetisation as a historic step and not a decision in isolation, he said it would bring about fundamental changes in political and economic system, including simultaneous elections and State-funding of elections. The war also could later be taken to black money in the form of gold and land. People to benefit The war against black money would ultimately benefit the people and that was the reason why the Prime Minister appealed to the people to bear with the inconvenience for 50 days. He addressed the nation because he knew about the problems that would arise from demonetisation of 86 per cent of the currency in circulation. He said that the Rs.2,000 note was not a substitute for Rs.1,000 and Rs.500 notes, and RBI had not indicated the volume of Rs.2,000 notes it would print. The demand for higher denomination notes could not be estimated and the government was seized of the matter. Higher revenues Demonetisation would result in considerably higher revenues for State and Central governments, enabling them take up construction of schools, hospitals, etc., Mr. Rao said. Mr. Modi had taken up the issue of bringing back black money stashed abroad, and because of limitations in international laws it could not be achieved, he said. The government, however, would not compromise on black money abroad. A SIT was constituted at the first Cabinet meeting. The mandate against black money was not divided, Mr. Rao said.

508,2016-11-20,13.0,Demonetisation hits buffalo meat exporters,"STRICT CONTROLS: Exporters find the withdrawal limit of Rs.50,000 per week inadequate. File photo
  With the demonetisation exercise severely hitting their operations, meat exporters have asked the government to lift curbs on cash withdrawal and related transactions to help them pay the traders as well as small and marginal farmers from whom they purchase buffaloes for slaughter. The All India Meat & Livestock Exporters Association (AIMLEA), in a representation to the commerce ministry, complained that the withdrawal limit of Rs.50,000 a week from the current account was not enough for these exporters to pay the entire chain of people – including traders (middlemen who purchase the buffaloes from farmers) and subsistence farmers - for the bovines, official sources said. They added that AIMLEA wants cash withdrawal and transaction curbs to be either done away with or eased. The commerce ministry has forwarded the representation to the finance ministry for further action. According to the AIMLEA, farmers who sell the bovines are mostly poor and without any bank account, and therefore, they are paid in cash, which they in turn use for activities including purchasing seeds and fertilisers and running their households. The buffalo meat sector in the country is largely unorganised. The regulators for the sector include the Agricultural & Processed Food Products Export Development Authority that falls under the commerce ministry’s jurisdiction as well as the Food Safety & Standards Authority of India (under the health & family welfare ministry). Similar complaints from exporters in other sectors, on the problems that they are facing due to the demonetisation policy, are being compiled, sources said, adding that the commerce ministry will soon hold discussions on the issue with representatives from various Export Promotion Councils. An August 2016 report by ICRA Ltd said, “Indian buffalo meat exports have grown at a Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of 29 per cent, from Rs.3,533 crore in FY08 to Rs.26,682 crore in FY16, enabling (the country) to overtake its close competitors Brazil and Australia to become the largest exporter of buffalo meat/beef, accounting for nearly 20 per cent of the world’s total buffalo meat/beef exports (in volume terms).” Buffalo meat has been the highest agri-related export item from India for the past two consecutive years and its contribution to the total export revenues of India has almost doubled to 1.56 per cent in FY2016 from 0.76 per cent in FY2011, it said. ICRA said it estimated that buffalo meat export revenues will grow to about Rs.40,000 crore by FY21, at a CAGR of eight per cent. The Indian buffalo meat sector has boomed thanks to the buffalo population increasing to 108.7 million in 2012 (as per the 2012 all India livestock census) from 43.4 million in 1951.

509,2016-11-20,13.0,"Pawar attacks demonetisation, calls for parivartan","MUMBAI: Days after sharing stage with Prime Minsiter Narendra Modi, Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) chief Sharad Pawar attacked Mr. Modi for the Centre’s demonetisation initiative and its implementation. Mr. Pawar was addressing a Parivartan rally at Ghatkopar, ahead of upcoming BMC elections. He said, “According to the Reserve Bank of India, only notes worth Rs. 400 crore of the total Rs. 17 lakh crore are fake, which means only 0.28 per cent notes are fake. Despite this, 86 per cent notes were demonetised to get rid of the 0.28-per cent fake notes. The government has added to the problems of the common people, and our Prime Minister is claiming that black money hoarders have lost their sleep.” Claiming that such developments will pose a danger to citizens, Mr. Pawar said parivartan (change) is the only option in the upcoming Lok Sabha and Assembly polls as well. Earlier last week, Mr. Pawar had welcomed demonetisation. “If a rich person has committed a mistake, then hang him. But do not put the poor, common man in trouble by terming his honest money as black money. If the head of the country is portraying this country as one of criminals, then it is our responsibility to prove that this nation belongs to hard workers and labourers,” he said, adding that people will teach ruling party leaders a lesson when they come asking for votes. The NCP chief also ridiculed the Rs. 98,000-crore Bullet Train project, saying Mr. Modi is in a hurry to reach Ahmedabad. “If this much of money is utilised in the right place, Mumbai, Delhi, Chennai and Kolkata will get better local trains. If you do not spend money to improve Mumbai’s transport, problems will only increase. Citizens of Mumbai must decide to sideline those who are trying to harm their interests,” he said.

510,2016-11-20,13.0,Demonetisation: SCB realises a fifth of its annual revenue,"The Secunderabad Cantonment Board has realised more than a fifth of its annual revenue in the last ten days alone, thanks to the demonetisation decision. The board raked in over Rs. 6 crore, largely in property tax, after it decided to accept payments in Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,000 currency notes. The SCB began accepting the demonetised currency on November 11. Officials say that they expect more revenue in the coming days. “A large chunk of the payments are from those who had not paid earlier. After an initial dilemma over whether the old notes should be accepted or not, we began the collections,” informed an SCB official. SCB’s revenue collection has increased in the recent years, mainly through revision of property tax rates and stringent collection norms. However, the collection has remained well below Rs. 50 crore, though talk of a potential Rs. 100 crore collection is common. With four more days to go before the deadline for acceptance of old notes elapses, taxmen are hopeful of more revenue collection. The SCB’s collection of toll tax at the entry and exit points is now being questioned as the Centre has exempted toll payment till November 24. A former ward member, Jai Prakash, made a representation to the SCB asking for exemption. When contacted, an SCB official, on condition of anonymity, said the toll collection was exempted on the highway, but at other entry and exit points of the SCB, it continues to be collected. It was also informed that toll collection has reduced by more than 30 per cent as the transport sector has been affected by lack of currency.

On Sunday, a delegation of traders held a meeting with Mr. Thackeray to explain hardships being faced by the trading community. “Not only your generation, but even the next generation is going to suffer from this decision. Are you going to remain silent? Do not sit idle and shed tears. Be prepared to fight against this autocratic decision,” Mr. Thackeray said. “He (Narendra Modi) was elected by the country’s 125-crore population, which was disillusioned with Congress rule. This population should have been taken into confidence before any such decision,” he said. Earlier, a delegation of traders held a meeting with the Sena chief, where he was informed that the trading business has taken a 70-per cent hit due to demonetisation. “Our business has come to a complete standstill. November and December are usually the best profit- making months for us, but demonetisation has completely changed the picture,” Viren Shah of the Federation of Retail Traders Welfare Association said after meeting. He added that the association has conveyed its problems to the Prime Minister in the past. “The government has taken the decision without adequate homework,” he said. Biren Lambichiya, another officer bearer of the association, said retail traders helped Mr. Modi come to power. “But now he is taking steps against us,” he said. Despite these strong opinions from the trading community, the Sena chief chose to not speak out against demonetisation. When asked whether he supports the traders’ demands, he asked other Sena leaders to speak. Sena leaders have made controversial statements in the last week. Party MP Anand Adsul said the Sena will withdraw support if the District Central Co-operative Banks are not allowed to exchange old notes. He later withdrew the statement. Sena’s mouthpiece Saamana wrote an editorial claiming Mr. Modi’s decision has led to financial anarchy. Several Sena MPs even participated in the protest walk organised by Opposition parties in Delhi against demonetisation. It was rumoured that Union Home Minister Rajnath Singh had even called Mr. Thackeray asking him to not participate in the protest march. Questioning the rationale behind the Jan Dhan scheme, Mr. Thackeray said the country’s farmers have opened accounts under scheme. “Now, by bringing restrictions on district central co-operative banks, the government is harming farmers’ interests. What was the rationale behind starting this scheme if you wanted to keep an eye on them as well?” he asked.

512,2016-11-20,13.0,Demonetisation stumps England cricket fans and tourists,"England fans cheering during the fourth day of the second Test cricket match between India and England at the ACA-VDCA Cricket Stadium in Vishakhapatnam on Sunday.  
| Photo Credit: K_R_DEEPAK;K_R_DEEPAK - The demonetisation of ₹ 500 and ₹ 1,000 notes has left scores of England tourists and cricket fans stumped who find themselves in a tight spot now. “We have been making endless visits to the ATMs from the past couple of days, but at most places there’s no cash. In fact, we took out ₹ 10,000 in the denominations of ₹ 500 and ₹ 1,000 just the day the demonetisation news broke. Now, we are stuck with several notes which are useless,” said Rebecca Honeycone from Canterbury, a cathedral city in southeast England. Rebecca is in Visakhapatnam with her husband Phillip to cheer the England cricket team as part of her India tour itinerary which began from October this year. “Our everyday expenses have escalated way beyond what we planned. We had to upgrade from homestays to bigger hotels which accept credit cards. If we go to see any tourist monument, the fee for a foreign tourist is ₹ 500 but nobody is accepting the ₹ 500 notes as a result we had to skip several such tourist places because we are guarding whatever little lower denomination notes we are left with for emergency needs,” said Phillip, her husband. “Some banks refused to entertain us as we are foreigners. Tomorrow we head to Hyderabad and there again will begin a next chapter for the hunt of ₹ 100 notes!” quipped Rebecca. There are hundreds of England cricket fans, who currently in Visakhapatnam and on an India tour, including the organised cricket fan groups like the Barmy Army that are often termed as the England team’s unofficial 12th man. Most of them said that they were facing problems as they mostly have the old ₹ 500 and ₹ 1,000 notes or are given ₹ 2,000 notes at airport forex counters. In Visakhapatnam, like in many other Indian cities, majority of ATMs are still not functioning properly. Oliver Terry from Nottingham, England, who was enjoying the cricket match on Sunday with several other England fans said: “Hotels and bars are the only places where we are finding change for ₹ 2,000 notes. We are buying beer cans and food collectively as a group for a high value bill. We have also noticed that most of the local vendors and stores are not willing to part with change.” “If we want to go out and see some tourist place, we cannot go as the taxi driver or autorickshaws are demanding new currency notes or money in lower denomination. We are not able to taste local delicacies or buy a pack of cigarettes as the stores are refusing to take old notes or give us change for the few ₹ 2,000 notes we are left with,” said John, another England cricket fan. His group fears that the Indian currency they hold in ₹ 500 and ₹ 1,000 denominations may go waste. John displayed his wallet containing wads of ₹ 1,000 and ₹ 500 notes and said: “I got several British pounds changed to rupees. What will happen to those notes?” Andrew Gosden from Lymington Hampshire said that this time he may have to disappoint his friends and family members back home as he doesn’t have enough lower denomination currencies to purchase souvenirs. “It is Christmas season for us and obviously my family will be eagerly waiting for me to get them some Indian souvenirs. But I am finding it tough to get change for the souvenirs in the local shops in cities,” he added.

513,2016-11-20,13.0,Demonetisation ill-planned: CPI,"CPI State secretary K. Ramakrishna  
| Photo Credit: C.V.Subrahmanyam ONGOLE: The CPI will organise State-wide protests for two days from Monday against the “indifference” of both the Central and State governments to the plight of the people in the wake of the “ill-planned” demonetisation exercise. “It is the common people who have been finding it hard to carry on daily activities and not high net worth individuals,” CPI State secretary K. Ramakrishna said, and referred to the poor and middle class people postponing marriages. He contrasted this scenario to the “lavish” marriage performed by a former BJP Minister to his daughter without any problem. In all, 55 persons died in incidents pertaining to cash crunch post-demonetisation period, he said, and referred to the Supreme Court’s observation whether it was a surgical strike on black money or carpet bombing on common people. Making a mention of Union Minister Sujana Chowdary comparing Special Category Status (SCS) to a scrapped Rs. 500 note, he said it was the TDP-BJP combine that would become obsolete in the 2019 elections. Earlier, addressing a meeting organised by the party, he pressed for providing reservations to the SCs, STs, and BCs in the private sector in the wake of dwindling public sector and ever-expanding private sector. Social justice could be ensured only by providing quota for the depressed classes in the private sector. Accusing the State government of diverting the budgetary allocations for the SCs, STs, and BCs, he said the party would organise protests on December 12. He also wanted the State government to declare Amaravati a free zone to ensure employment for people of all the 13 districts in the State capital.

514,2016-11-20,13.0,Demonetisation woes continue,"VISAKHAPATNAM: The closure of banks, for the first time after demonetisation by the government, added to the woes of the public on Sunday. Customers were greeted by ‘not working’ boards at many of the ATMs, some ATMs downed their shutters, while others witnessed long queues. Long queues were seen at the ATMs of SBI at Dwaraka Nagar and Rednam Gardens on Sunday. The HDFC Bank ATM at Dwarakanagar also witnessed long line of customers while the ICICI ATMs at Madhavadhara and Dwarakanagar downed shutters. People were seen trying to exchange their Old High Denomination (OHD) notes at fuel stations. Small traders, fish vendors and the general public continued to face problems even after 12 days of the government’s decision on big notes. “Motorists have stopped coming for repairs unless they feel it absolutely important to go for immediate repairs. Some are bringing old Rs.500 notes for repairs costing Rs.100 or so and we cannot give them change,” said Tata Rao, a motorcycle mechanic, who has his shop beside Sankar Matham. “We are telling customers that if they give Rs.2000 note, the bill should be at least Rs.1600 or more. Our cash transactions dropped by around 50 per cent. On the positive side, however, we have noticed a quantum jump in card transactions,” said an employee of a restaurant near Diamond Park. There is a drastic fall in fish sales at the Nehru Bazaar. “Customers are giving Rs.2000 note for making purchases of Rs.200. This is for the first time that we are experiencing such a problem,” said Pydamma, who has been selling fish for the past 30 years. “We used to make sales to the tune of Rs.15,000 a day before demonetisation. Now we hardly make around Rs.5,000. You can estimate how much we are losing every day,” said Kodanda, another fish vendor. The fish market near RTC Complex presented a different picture with many vendors accepting OHD notes. “We are accepting OHD notes as we cannot afford to lose business. The dip in sales is partly due to the auspicious Karteeka masam, when many consumers avoid taking non-vegetarian food. It was a similar story at the Fishing Harbour on Sunday. The normally busy vendors were seen awaiting customers. “Demonetisation is good but the poor could have been given the OHD notes instead of dumping them in the drains,” said Lakshmi, a vendor.

515,2016-11-20,13.0,Demonetisation may hit fee reimbursement,"The present cash crunch and the huge projected decline in the State’s income in near future due to withdrawal of high-denomination notes may impact the fee reimbursement scheme in Telangana that is already in controversies over pending bills for the last two years. With Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao himself reportedly expecting a fall of Rs. 2,000 crore in the State’s revenue, college managements fear that the scheme may be hit badly. Their fears gain strength from the fact that the Government itself indicated the revenue shortfall, which will have a direct impact on welfare schemes. Apart from taxes from real the estate sector, the Government foresees taxes declining in excise, luxury and entertainment sector. The college managements say that the Government still owed them Rs. 2,050-odd crore and, after a few threats of closure, had released some amount, which was insufficient. In fact, Rs. 258 crore was released recently though the Government had promised Rs. 600 crore but the colleges say even that amount has not reached them. The Chief Minister also assured the managements, and later announced in the Assembly, that all dues would be cleared and the slate would be clean once the new academic year commenced. But not much progress had been made. In the backdrop of demonetisation, college managements met Deputy Chief Minister Kadiam Srihari and Power Minister. G. Jagadish Reddy on Saturday to seek an assurance. “We did appraise them of our fears and concerns and the Ministers assured us to do the best,” said Satish and Siddeshwar of the Degree Colleges Managements Association. Fee reimbursement has not been on the priority list of the Government that has actually found several loopholes in the system and wanted to plug them. The series of inspections done by the universities first and by the Task Force, including policemen, later actually sent a signal to the colleges that the Government wanted to dilute it or at least make changes to escape the huge burden. Senior officials in the education department agree that revenue shortfall is imminent and fee reimbursement is definitely on the non-priority list of the Government. “Unless the Central Government supports the scheme it will certainly take a hit,” a senior official, unwilling to be quoted, said. College managements fear that if the payments are delayed, an additional Rs. 2500 crore would be added to the existing dues. The uncertainty over the impact of demonetisation is likely to hit the very survival of small and medium colleges in the rural sector as they totally depend on the Government’s support.

516,2016-11-20,13.0,"Demonetisation, a badly planned move: Ajit Jogi","Former Chhattisgarh Chief Minister Ajit Jogi has criticised Prime Minister Narendra Modi for the “badly implemented” decision of demonetisation. “The PM thought that he will go down in the history as someone who got rid of black money, but now he will go down in the history as someone who was not fit to be the Prime Minister and who did not realise the meaning of demonetisation,” Mr. Jogi told The Hindu. Lashing out at the BJP government, Mr. Jogi, the chief of the Chhattisgarh Janata Congress, said the demonetisation decision was taken with an eye on the Assembly elections in Uttar Pradesh and Punjab. “It was a badly planned move. The same objective could have been achieved by planning its implementation in a better manner. When they [the BJP] realised that they could not recover the NPAs [non-performing assets] from industrialists, they thought that they would recover it from the common public. The common man has suffered badly, especially in rural areas where there are no banks. You have restricted co-operative banks from changing notes. It is becoming difficult for farmers and common people in the rural areas to manage the day-to-day life,” Mr. Jogi said. He also predicted that demonetisation would damage the prospects of the BJP in the elections. “The only saving for him [the PM] is that the elections are two-three years away and the people have a short memory. But this time, even the common public will find it difficult to forget this as they had to stand in queues for hours for their own money. There is hardly any way to deal with it apart from a partial roll back or some concessions at least in rural areas. People are being forced to walk hundreds of kilometres for their own money in rural parts,” he added. To a question on the alleged extra-judicial killings of tribals in Chhattisgarh, Mr. Jogi said the controversial officer, under whose watch the alleged excesses were happening, was “once very close to him.” “Even Narendra Modi and Chief Minister Raman Singh have no control over the administration in Bastar. The majority of encounters are fake and 75 per cent of those who are surrendering as Maoists are common people. If this continues, we will never be able to get rid of Maoist insurgency in Bastar. Being a tribal, I don’t even feel like going there [Bastar]. Both sides [the police and the Maoists] are killing people at will. Even senior journalists and academicians like Nandini Sundar are being targeted. The government’s approach is totally wrong with respect to Bastar,” Mr. Jogi said.

  Prime Minister Narendra Modi said on Sunday that the country would emerge victorious after the Centre’s demonetisation move, which he called a “trial by fire.” “As I said on the very first day when I announced the decision, it is a time-consuming process. It will cause inconvenience and a little hardship but, I believe, the nation will come out victorious from this trial by fire,” Mr. Modi said at a public rally in the city of the Taj in Uttar Pradesh. “I have asked for 50 days. It’s been just 10 days and money over over Rs. 5,000 crore has already been deposited in banks... the banks will infuse this money in the markets,” he added. Mr. Modi said he did not take the decision to trouble anyone but for the good of the coming generations. A veiled attack

 In remarks seen as a sharp attack on West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee, Mr. Modi said that political leaders behind multi-crore chit fund scams were attacking him over demonetisation as they have been hit hard by the move. He also hit out at the Congress, saying the previous governments had kept quiet on the issue of black money because they were worried about losing power. Addressing the ‘Parivartan rally, ‘Mr. Modi cautioned people holding Jan Dhan accounts not to allow themselves to be used for laundering unaccounted money. “I know what sort of people are raising their voice against me? Does the country not know whose money was invested in chit fund business? Lakhs and crores of poor people invested money in chit funds. But with the blessings of politicians, crores and crores of rupees have vanished. Due to chit fund loss, hundreds of head of families were forced to commit suicide. Look at history and they are questioning me,” he said.

After four months of excavation at the Haifeng Town in Huanghua City, the ruins of an ancient hearth, fire pits and wall footings have been uncovered among bricks, tiles and broken porcelain. Staff working at the site have also unearthed a 6-meter-wide main road, flanked on both sides by the ruins of buildings. Jin and Yuan dynasties Judging from preliminary assessment of the unearthed ruins and items, they are presumed to have been used during the Jin (960-1276) and Yuan (1271-1368) dynasties, said Lei Jianhong, director of the research office for underwater archaeology at the Hebei Cultural Relics Institute, state-run Xinhua news agency reported. The excavation area, which is 30-meter-long and 10-meter-wide, is only a small part of the building cluster of the Haifeng Town ruins. It was bustling with activity once The rich findings indicate that there was intense human activity at the site and the ancient town is likely to have had a flourishing economy and trade, said Mr. Lei, who led the dig starting in July. It is the fourth excavation of the Haifeng Town ruins. Standing at the mouth of a river, the town is thought to have been a port for the trade of porcelain and salt. Scholars have said the ancient Haifeng Town is likely to be the northern tip of the Maritime Silk Road, from which Chinese porcelain was shipped across East Asia and beyond. But this cannot be verified until further archaeological findings are made.

According to a senior official, who did not wish to be quoted, “Coming in the face of logjam in Parliament and conflicting voices from chief ministers across the country, this decision is intended to convey that there is no going back on Mr. Modi’s announcement. At the maximum New Delhi is ready to look into the possible short and medium term measures to alleviate the suffering of the people from all walks of life and of the business and industry.” Jagannath Srinivasan, a director-level officer in the Ministry of Personnel and Pension, on Friday night issued an office memorandum listing the names of the officers who have been deputed to different States and Union Territories. “The undersigned is directed to refer to the above mentioned subject and to say that the following officers are hereby deputed to undertake field visits in various States (as listed below) for making on the spot assessment of the situation and to provide feedback thereon,” the memorandum said. A senior official in the ministry told The Hindu that respective teams from each assigned State would submit a report to the government on how exactly the decision of the Prime Minister is being implemented. “They would, of course, identify the bottlenecks in the system so that whatever course correction is required from New Delhi can be applied.” The official said that the Centre is ready to look at demands from various quarters, be it the State governments or the industry and commerce circles to see how best the ‘pain’ could be minimised.

  Alleging that Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s decision to demonetise currency in the denomination of Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,000 was without a “visionary approach”, Chief Minister Siddaramaiah said here on Saturday that the step had hit the common man and not those who had stashed black money. Addressing Congress workers at the birth centenary celebrations of the former Prime Minister Indira Gandhi at the Nehru Maidan here, he said that demonetisation had worried only ordinary people and not those having black money. “Are those who have been standing in queue in front of banks and ATMs are having black money? It is the common man who has been having sleepless nights and not those having black money,” Mr. Siddaramaiah said. The Chief Minister said that the Union government should have ensured that Rs. 100 and the new Rs. 500 notes were made available in enough numbers. “Now, many ordinary people, petty traders, and patients are suffering because of the non-availability of denomination of other currency in enough number. The Prime Minister did not think about the implications of the decision and that is why it is a step lacking a visionary approach,” he said. Mr. Siddaramaiah said that when Morarji Desai was the Prime Minister, he too had demonetised some notes in 1978. Late Ms. Gandhi took a “revolutionary step” in 1969 by nationalising 14 private banks. They included SyndicateBank, Canara Bank, Corporation Bank and Vijaya Bank based in Mangaluru. The Chief Minister said that the former Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee had called late Ms. Gandhi ‘iron lady’ after India won the 1971 war with Pakistan and liberated Bangladesh. B Ramanath Rai, Minister in-charge of Dakshina Kannada said that the party workers should work hard for making the party win all eight seats in the next Assembly elections.

Ramachandran Memorial Lecture organised by The Southern India Chamber of Commerce and Industry. “Banks would be flooded with deposits, which can be used to create a multiplier effect by circulating them back in the economy,” he said. The move will increase the tax base, which is very important to curb the parallel black money economy. The flow of counterfeit currency from Bangladesh and other countries has stopped. The move will give a massive boost to the digital economy, he said. “Our economy will be less cash and more digital. This would lead to lot of digital innovation where fin-tech firms will thrive,” he noted.

525,2016-11-20,13.0,19-11-01-Demonetisation-Weddings,"New Delhi: The big, fat Delhi wedding seems to have gone on a diet thanks to the ongoing demonetisation exercise. From band wallahs to ghodi wallahs and from caterers to photographers, the crunch in liquid cash has affected every service provider with families of brides and grooms mutually agreeing to trim excess expenditure. Sixty-year-old Sunil Kashyap (name changed), whose daughter got married on November 12, said the sudden deficit in liquid cash had left fathers like him no option. “I remember sweating while I stood in line outside an ATM at 2 a.m. — my third since the announcement earlier in the evening of November 8 — wondering how, if at all, we would be able to pull it off,” he said. Fortunately for him, Mr. Kashyap said, the banquet hall owner and caterer had been paid most of their dues in advance a week ago; however, exchange gifts ranging from fruit baskets to blankets and bedsheets still needed to be purchased and led him to a local currency dealer who demanded a 10 per cent commission to exchange Rs, 100 notes for older notes. “I decided not to risk it and promised the guests that their exchange gifts would be delivered to them as soon as I could purchase them with my debit card; what I do regret is that even the milni (the ceremonial introduction of family members from both sides accompanied with an exchange of money) had to be done with old Rs. 500 and Rs. 1000 notes,” Mr. Kashyap added. Ashok Chadha, a businessman based in Noida, said the cash crunch had led him to dispense with the ceremonial ghodi ( arrival of the groom ona horse) and cut down on the contingent of band wallahs (musicians) from his son's wedding on November 25. “I've told the band company owner to spare as big or small a group that he can with the cash advance I gave him and my son's in-laws say they have no issues with him turning up in the doli (ceremonial palanquin) instead of a ghodi to pick up his bride. Postponing or cancelling a wedding is too much to handle – better a small wedding than none,” he said. Decisions like Mr. Chadha's, said Virender Singh from the popular Chawla Band in Karol Bagh, had severely affected his business. “As if the fact that walk-in customers have completely stopped making enquiries wasn't enough, bookings are being cancelled every day because of the cash crunch. We have begun taking post-dated cheques so that the entire wedding season doesn't go to waste,” he said. Gaurav from Sindhi Hira Nand Ghori Wale, one of the oldest wedding planners in the Capital based out of Beadon Pura in Karol Bagh's Band Market said the cash crunch had completely crippled business. “Business is destroyed either way because of the lack of liquidity. Even if we accept payment cheque, how will we pay our staff who work solely on a per-day and cash payment basis like daily wagers?” he complained. Mohit Birla from Mohit Birla Photography, said business had been affected “to some extent” but not as severely as one would expect. “I do not work on cash as a principle but business has been affected to a small degree; I had ten bookings this month out of which one had to be cancelled because the party seemed to have run out of cash but the others are scheduled as per plan,” he said. Vijender Singh Rawat, a caterer operating out of Kaushambi, said he was operating on credit. “A marriage isn't something that either family can afford to postpone or cancel so we are doing all we can to offer clients our services on credit basis if they can't afford to pay through cheque at the moment,” he said.

528,2016-11-20,13.0,Sculptors feel the pinch of demonetisation,"The demonetisation has put a group of families engaged in making stone idols at Nagalapuram village, bordering the Tiruchi-Perambalur districts, in a soup. At least 15 finished idols have been gathering dust at each shop -- (called ‘pattarai’ in local parlance) -- in the village, as most of those who placed orders have not come forward to take delivery for want of small denomination currencies. The village accounts for three major ‘pattarai’ each ‘pattarai’ having a strength of at least 10 labourers. Thus, as many as 30 workers have been left in the lurch as they are unable to get wages for their work. The men are involved in making idols, mostly catering to the needs of rural temples. These sculptors have learnt the art from their forefathers and are skilled in making different forms of gods and goddesses. Lord Ganapathy, Sri Perumal, Sri Chellayi Amman, Sri Ondikaruppanna Swamy and Sri Mariamman are the main deities for which there has been a consistent demand. Each idol is priced between Rs. 10,000 and Rs. 35,000 depending on its size and intricate carvings involved. “Although we had readied the idols based on orders, most of them have been idling at our shops,” says G. Venugopal, one of the ‘pattarai’ owners. The major financial set back he faces is due to the huge investment on idols of bigger size with intricate craftsmanship. Two idols -- Sri Chandikeswari and Sri Bairavar - which were priced at Rs. 1.25 lakh each are yet to be taken. The height of the idol is 5.5 feet and involves complex workmanship,” he said. Although he had taken an advance, it was just part of the expenditure meant for the stone and labour wages. Another sculptor, V. Lakshminarayanan, said that labourers were finding it difficult to eke out their livelihood, although they could manage by exchanging the old currencies. Every ‘pattarai’ disburses wages on monthly basis on the first working day every month. ‘We do not know what to do on December 1, when we should disburse wages. We only hope that the situation would ease by then,” he said. Workers who have pinned their hopes on their masters, have been working with their chisels and hammers. The sculptors said that they purchase stones from Oothukuli for making the idols. “We first ascertain the quality of stones so that we do not incur any loss due to any defect,” Mr. Venugopal says. They accept the order and work on an idol after taking an advance from the temple authorities. “We have stocked a large number of idols in our thatched shed, all awaiting delivery,” he says.

  SRIKAKULAM: Over 1.5 lakh farmers were hit with the demonetisation of the Rs.1,000 and Rs.500 notes as they are not able to deposit the currency in the branches of the Srikakulam District Cooperative Central Bank (DCCB). The Srikakulam DCCB has 15 branches across the district but they stopped taking old currency notes following a directive of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI). The development has come as a big jolt to the DCCB as well as the farmers who have been utilising the services of the cooperative bank for many years. Many DCCB account holders do not have accounts in other banks and they even did not open accounts in public sector banks when the PM’s Jan Dhan campaign was taken up vigorously two years ago. They are now moving from pillar to post to open new accounts in public sector banks but the banks are unable to offer the service due to time constraint and the heavy work load at this juncture. “We are forced to travel all the way to towns with money. But there is no use as neither the DCCB nor the PSU banks are accepting the old cash,” said J.L. Naidu, a villager of Gara in the District. Many villagers who took gold loans are not able to clear them due to the non-acceptance of old currency. Some of them wanted to close gold loan accounts and take back jewellery for the wedding season but the DCCB officials are expressing helplessness citing the RBI orders that they should not accept the scrapped currency. Protest in Vijayawada Srikakulam DCCB president Dola Jaganmohana Rao deplored the decision of the RBI. “The RBI is sending wrong signals to the people by not allowing DCCBs to accept old currency. It creates many troubles to farmers in the backward Srikakulam district,” he said. “We are going to agitate in Vijayawada to oppose the rules of RBI and Union government,” he added.

While demonetisation made black money worthless GST prevents illegal transactions using the new currency. Under the new GST there is a low possibility of unreported transactions, he opined. From recording transactions to checking their validity, the new GST provides for an automated process that is foolproof. “While the earlier policy had these provisions the new one makes the provisions more effective,” he said. The expert recommended a 12 per cent tax rate across all commodities. While there are close to four broad tax baskets that can further be divided into three more sub-baskets, it is advisable for the government to make it a unified tax with direct benefits for the less privileged, Mr. Poddar added.

531,2016-11-20,13.0,Banks worried over safety of demonetised currency,"Banks operating in the four districts — Adilabad, Kumram Bheem Asifabad, Mancherial and Nirmal — are now worried over safety of the building stock of demonetised currency notes in different branches as most of the over 300 bank branches in the four districts do not have ‘proper’ strongrooms. On an average, the main branch of State Bank of Hyderabad in Adilabad town, which is also the Lead Bank, is receiving demonetised currency notes with a face value of Rs. 8 crore every day while some others in important centres like Mancherial and Nirmal are receiving about Rs. 3 crore in old Rs 500 and Rs 1000 notes. The rest of the branches of the 31 banks have received the demonetised notes with a face value of about Rs. 1.5 to Rs. 2 crore by way of exchange during the last 10 days. Piling up “Many of our branches in rural areas have about Rs. 2 crore each of demonetised currency notes and safety is the main concern as these branches operate out of private premises which do not have proper strongrooms,” pointed out an official of the Telangana Grameena Bank, which has over 100 branches under its two Regional Offices operating in the rural areas of the four districts. “The SBH, our sponsor bank and the chest branch, should take the notes as our bank will stand to lose heavily in case of any eventuality,” added the worried officer. “Banks can transport the banned currency notes to their own chests as we too are flooded with the exchanged notes. We will accept once RBI clears our pile,” clarified SBH Assistant General Manager P. Umamaheswara Rao. Allocation of notes The TBG has also accused the SBH of discrimination in apportioning of cash for day-to-day operations in its branches. “We are disbursing cash judiciously because of the crunch we are facing,” the AGM explained. “The SBH main branch disburses about Rs. 10 lakh to each of the 10 banks which have their accounts with it while it gives Rs. 50 lakh to the TGB which operates 21 branches. It is not enough for our operations as we have a large customer base and serve in rural areas,” the TGB official noted. The constraint imposed by demonetisation on banking operations is likely to ease somewhat as the government has restricted the quantum value of exchange of old notes to Rs. 2,000. “The move will certainly bring down the demand for valid currency notes,” Mr. Umamaheswara Rao agreed.

532,2016-11-20,13.0,Demonetisation hits liquor sale in Odisha,"The demonetisation of high value currency notes has adversely affected the sale of liquor across Odisha with most of the outlets reporting a decline in sales even as queues outside ATMs and banks continued to swell. Of the total 3,843 liquor shops in the state, 50 per cent have reported a decline in sales following banning of Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 currency notes from November 8 mid-night, an official at the excise department said. In this backdrop Excise Revenue collection is likely to be badly hit even as the State government has set a target of Rs 3,300 crore collection during the ongoing fiscal. While the excise collection in 2015-16 was Rs 2,568 crore, this time the government expected an additional Rs 800 crore. The liquor is supplied to the licensed shops through Odisha State Beverage Corporation Limited (OSBC). The business of the Corporation has been considerably less during November in several districts as compared to earlier months, the official said, adding that the volume of liquor sale has also slipped in hotels and restaurants. The excise personnel on the basis of feedback received from sale counters acknowledged that the IMFL and country liquor sale plummeted drastically. “Though we do not maintain weekly sale records, the sale of both IMFL and country spirit has made a nosedive drastically. The officials at the ground level have informed regarding the fall of sale of liquor of all varieties,” said Kendrapara district Excise Superintendent, Ram Narayan Seth. Jagatsinghpur Excise Superintendent Rajat Kuamar Praharaj also reported about a similar situation in his district. “The number of consumers visiting the shop has dropped considerably since the November 8 announcement. The average daily sale in our counter was more than Rs 5,000 earlier. But now it has come down to Rs 2,000 or less. We are not entertaining customers who are visiting to buy liquor with demonetised notes,” said the manager of an IMFL counter in Kendrapara, Sudam Charan Sahu. “We do not want to disappoint the regular customers. We are accepting scrapped notes for liquor. However we have fixed a ceiling for purchase of Rs 350 or more. We are forced to do so as there is possibility of regular customers skipping visit to our shop in future,” a staffer in another retail IMFL shop, Rajani Mohanty, said. Decline in liquor sale is also affecting small eateries. “I was earning about Rs 5000 daily prior to November 8. It has now come down to Rs 1000,” said Brundaban Sahu, a roadside eatery owner near an IMFL shop. - PTI “We are not entertaining customers visiting to buy liquor with demonetised notes” Printable version | Jan 7, 2017 1:26:33 AM | http://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/Demonetisation-hits-liquor-sale-in-Odisha/article16668700.ece © The Hindu The Hindu revisits the gruesome December 2012 gang-rape to examine if Delhi is any safer for the average woman today"

MustafahK_K_Mustafah
  Normal life in the plantation town of Nelliampathy has been crippled as the lone automated teller machine (ATM) and a minor banking institution with hardly three employees have stopped functioning in the wake of the currency crisis. Among the 56 plantations in the hill station located close to the Parambikulam tiger reserve, hardly 15 are functioning now and most of the employees are daily wagers. Following demonetisation, most of the plantations are yet to pay October month’s salary to the workers. On the other hand, tourism in the hill station has also been badly affected due to the crisis. With none of the shops and eateries in Nelliampathy accepting plastic money, travellers are facing much difficulty. The nearest ATMs are located 40 km away in Nenmara, but there too, these are not functioning. According to managerial staff at AVT Group’s Manaloor Estate, the largest in the Nelliampathy hills, the wages for 800 workers was deposited in the bank two days before the demonetisation was announced. The lone Syndicate Bank branch is unable to release the wages because of the deficiency of currencies. The hill station has more than 6,000 plantation workers. Each tea worker gets daily wages of Rs.310.70 apart from a weekly allowance of Rs 60. In coffee and cardamom estates, there is slight variation. “Most workers prefer to get the money by cash from the bank counter. Majority of them do not have debit cards,” says C. Koyakkutty, a member of the local grama panchayat. “Among the workers, a huge portion are migrant labourers from North Indian states. They would lose a day’s salary if they take buses to Nenmara or Alathoor to withdraw from banks there. Shops are releasing provisions on credit. But that also is a temporary mechanism,” said Balan Nair, who runs a tea shop. “The troubles of plantation workers doubled after the currency crisis started hitting rural India.

  Like ever year, Tibetan refugees from Odisha, Karnataka and other parts of the country came to the city a month ago with loads of winter wear. They had set up shops on the canal bund, near Alankar Centre, and began sale a fortnight ago with the hopes of making profits at the end of the season. Unfortunately, the announcement of demonetisation and the subsequent fall in sales of their products only indicates a dull business for them. Post announcement of withdrawal of the Old High Denomination bank notes, the sales at these special stalls plummeted. One of the traders from Chandragiri in Odisha, Tenzil Dorjee, says, “Business is very dull since the day one. Post withdrawal of high value currency, the number of visitors too came down. It seems the situation continues further.” The traders are also finding it difficult to exchange their cash which they got through sales before November 8. “Only a few customers are giving Rs. 2,000 notes and buying stuff worth that much. Otherwise we are unable to given change in Rs. 100 notes or accept Rs. 500 and Rs. 1000 denominations,” said another trader. All the traders, in an understanding, fix the prices of their products ranging from shawls to sport jackets, including hand woven products. Not just demonetisation, but also lack of cool weather is affecting the sales. “The temperature is not cool enough for people to buy woollen wear yet. Even this is a reason for poor sales and we faced this the last year too,” Mr. Dorjee, a full-time farmer said. Each trader makes a business of Rs. 3 lakh to Rs. 4 lakh during their three-month stay here. The sale ends in mid of January next year. Interestingly all the products are sold at fixed prices and there will be no chance for bargain.

Ramachandran Memorial Lecture organised by The Southern India Chamber of Commerce and Industry. “Banks would be flooded with deposits, which can be used to create a multiplier effect by circulating them back in the economy,” he said. The move will increase the tax base, which is very important to curb the parallel black money economy. The flow of counterfeit currency from Bangladesh and other countries has stopped. The move will give a massive boost to the digital economy, he said. “Our economy will be less cash and more digital. This would lead to lot of digital innovation where fin-tech firms will thrive,” he noted.

  As currency crisis is sweeping all over, people have also taken recourse to smart ways to beat it. In the City of Destiny not to be cowed down due to shortage of currency notes, many having Rs.500 and Rs.1,000 notes which were demonetised on midnight of November 8, have started approaching e-seva centres, BSNL and certain bank counters to pay their dues. Some of them were seen striking a deal with others by convincing them to hand over their Rs.100 notes in exchange of paying their dues by swiping their credit/debit cards. “I came here for treatment of my father-in-law. As we were left with high denomination notes which were declared not a legal tender, I asked one person with two Rs.2,000 notes to give them to me. In exchange, I swiped my credit card,” Sandhya Choudhury, home-maker from Sagarnagar, said. Andhra Bank and a few other banks offering acceptance of old notes for clearing credit dues also came as a big relief to many. “I could pay my entire dues by depositing 10 notes of Rs.1,000,” admitted Ramasubba Rao, private sector employee. Some were seen requesting customers at BSNL MVP Colony service centre to hand over them new note of Rs.2,000 in exchange of old notes. E-seva centres all over the State are accepting property tax and other payments due to the government with old notes. By crowd-sourcing, a Bengaluru-based startup cashnocash.com is providing information on ATMs where cash is available pan India. “Since Monday, the day we launched the website which provides information by typing area pin core, we are getting an overwhelming response,” Hiree co-founder Manjunath Talwar said. NASSCOM 10k startup programme manager Vijay Bawra said the website gives information on ATMs in any city where there is not much rush to enable people to draw cash. Meanwhile, online campaign through social media on not to hide Rs.20, Rs.50 and Rs.100 currency notes and circulate them in the market is fast catching up.

Freedom fighters sacrificed their lives to make India independent. Those who are supporting demonetisation are freedom fighters for economic independence...There are people who are opposing the move. They are nothing but anti-nationals,” said Mr. Fadnavis. The CM went on to compare the plight of citizens facing the cash crunch to the Army jawans. “Our jawans stand at the border to protect the country. They do not have any personal animosity with Pakistan. If they can do it, can’t you suffer for 50 days for the country’s benefit?” Reacting to his comments, the Congress said declaring the opposition as anti-national is nothing but an attempt to shift the democratic country towards dictatorship. “For the last two years, the Sangh parivar and the BJP have been playing the game of patriotism. All those who are talking against Mr. Modi are being termed anti-nationals. Protesting the irresponsible government and lousy bureaucracy cannot be anti-national,” said party spokesperson Sachin Sawant. He said the government has taken the decision without proper homework and adequate measures. “The actual black money hoarders are out in the open, but common citizens are standing in queues to withdraw their honestly-earned money.” Printable version | Jan 7, 2017 1:27:06 AM | http://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/Those-against-demonetisation-are-anti-nationals-Fadnavis/article16671677.ece © The Hindu SamBar, the new resto-bar that’s replaced Khar’s Loca Loca, has inventive cocktails and fun finger food inspired by the cuisine from south of the Vindhyas"

Ms. Banerjee would be in Delhi on November 23 and 24 and hold a rally at Lucknow on November 29 followed by events in Bihar on December 1 and 2 and also visit Punjab. ‘No personal interest’ “We are ready to join any political programme and anyone can join our programme. This is a movement of people. I have no personal interest in this,” she said. Her announcement came 72 hours after her deadline in Delhi that she would go for nationwide protests if the government did not withdraw demonetisation. In West Bengal, her party Trinamool Congress (TMC) had already announced plans of a State-wide protest on Wednesday. While she raised questions on the “hidden agenda” for demonetisation, she accused Prime Minister Narendra Modi of threatening the opposition. “The Prime Minister is threatening other parties who are raising their voices against demonetisation. PM should be sober. PM should behave like a PM. If necessary, he should convene an all-party meeting on the issue,” she said, adding that she would not be “cowed down by such threats.” “Don’t take it like an ego fight.

The agitation will begin at 10 am on November 24 and end at 10 am the next day. In a statement here, LDF convenor Vaikkom Vishwan said the Centre and the Bharatiya Janata Party were trying to strangle Kerala’s cooperative sector which has been a life line of the people of Kerala. The LDF’s stand is to organise a general platform of protest cutting across political affiliation. It wanted all persons active in the cooperative sector to stand united in the attempts to save it. Mr. Vishwan said the Centre had failed to solve the difficulties faced by the people as a result of the demonetisation of the high value currency notes. The crisis became acute because sufficient precautionary steps were not taken prior to withdrawing the notes from circulation. He alleged that the attempts to undermine the cooperative sector was pre-planned . The sector had been able to attract the trust of people and attempt was to destroy this by creating panic situation. The CPI(M) state secretariat issued a statement expressing solidarity with the day and night agitation called by the LDF. It said that the entire state, irrespective of politial affiliation, was opposed to the moves to undermine the cooperative sector. It wanted all other political parrites to cooperate with the LDF’s agitation and convert into an unanimous voice against the Cetnre’s decision. The CPI state secretary Kanam Rajendran issued a statement extending his party’s full support to the LDF agitation against the Centre’s attempt to paralyse the rural economy of the State.

  Worried that the demonetisation exercise may hit the output of India's labour-intensive export sectors in the short-term, the commerce ministry on Monday said it will take up with the finance ministry a proposal to enhance the weekly cash withdrawal limit of Rs 50,000 from the current account for these exporters. This followed various Export Promotion Councils (EPC) informing the commerce ministry that the demonetisation policy has resulted in difficulties in disbursing wages to seasonal & migrant workers in labour-intensive sectors such as agriculture, carpet, handicrafts, handloom, leather, textiles and engineering, in addition to problems in cash payment to truckers & their support-staff. These EPCs wanted the government to raise the weekly cash withdrawal limit of Rs 50,000 to as high as Rs 5 lakh. However, the apex exporters’ body -- the Federation of Indian Export Organisations (FIEO) -- told the commerce ministry that the withdrawal limit may be increased from Rs 50,000 per week to a monthly limit of one per cent of the previous year's turnover of each company/firm. “The said (higher) limit can easily be operated by the banks as they have access to the balance sheet and turnover details of each firm/company. The supply of smaller denomination notes may also be increased,” FIEO said. After holding a meeting with EPCs that lasted for over an hour, commerce minister Nirmala Sitharaman told reporters that she will soon take up with the finance ministry the demands put forward by labour-intensive export sectors to raise the weekly cash withdrawal ceiling of Rs 50,000 from the current account. Sectors such as handloom, handicrafts, textiles and carpet employ a large number of seasonal and migrant workers who do not have a bank account, and therefore, their wages are paid in cash, she said, adding that even engineering sector firms procure some inputs such as scrap metal from people in the informal/unorganised sector and without bank accounts. Citing the difficulties due to the government's surprise move to withdraw the legal tender status of high-value currency notes in the denomination of Rs 500 and Rs 1000 from the midnight of November 8, these labour-intensive export sectors said they will be reducing their production capacity by as much as 40 per cent in the short-term, which in turn will lead to a lower output. “We have assured the exporters that we will soon send our report to the finance ministry so that quick remedial measures can be taken,” Ms. Sitharaman said. Economic losses However, the minister said so far no one has quantified the economic losses incurred by the export sectors due to the demonetisation exercise. She added that the impact is unlikely to last beyond a fortnight as the government is speeding up the process of ensuring cash at the ATMs as well as taking other necessary remedial measures such as lower denomination notes. Ravi Sehgal, Senior Vice Chairman of the apex engineering exporters’ body EEPC India, said: “This (weekly withdrawal limit of Rs 50,000) is inadequate and is affecting most of the small and medium scale units. Some companies have a weekly system of wages where workers seek payment in cash. Though the workers have bank accounts, they are unwilling to accept direct payment to their banks largely because if the amount exceeds Rs. 50,000 this would lead them to forfeit their subsidy benefits for below poverty line (BPL) account.” Besides, with the transport sector being affected by demonetisation, the movement of export cargo has been hit, Mr Sehgal said. According to the FIEO, the demonetisation policy may lead to the economy slowing down particularly in the sectors primarily dealing in cash, but it would be a course correction for larger inclusive growth and greater push to Indian economy in the long-term. “For micro and small companies and those dealing with unorganised sector, payment of wages to workers is currently a challenge as the workers are not keen to take the wages through cheque. Many of them coming from distant areas may not have bank account at their place of work. Those exporters procuring in small quantities like fruits & vegetables from farmers or handicraft from artisans or sending goods for job work, are also reporting the same problem,” the FIEO said. It added that in some cases where firms were looking at capacity expansion, there are delays in construction work as contractors are seeking payments in cash to in turn pay their workers.

543,2016-11-21,14.0,Demonetisation hits farm sector hard,"A farmer of Kandlkonda in Prakasam district pouring out his woes following demonetisation.
  ONGOLE: Demonetisation has come at an inopportunate time for the farming community as November is the month when khariff crop harvest picks up pace, coinciding with the sowing of rabi crop in Prakasam district. Farm sector is among the worst-affected with farmers badly in need of cash to complete the harvest of khariff crops saved against odds in view of drought and start sowing of the winter crops like Bengal gram and tobacco. Thanks to tight liquidity position, the price of vegetables and other crops are falling. Cotton growers are in an unenvious position with the price of white gold crashing to about Rs. 4,100 per quintal in the market from about Rs. 5,600 per quintal in the pre-demonetisation period. “Adding to our woes, the traders are asking us to accept payments in scrapped notes of Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,000,” says a group of cotton growers from Inkollur who have deferred plucking hoping that the cash crunch will ease in the next one week to 10 days. They welcomed the Centre’s decision to allow scrapped notes for purchase of seed and fertilisers during the rabi season. The monetary crisis has brought to the fore the resilience of the farming community in the post-demonetisation phase. Farmers, who have been hitherto used to cash transactions mostly, are exploring all ways to stay afloat and undergo pain in the fond hope that better days will come. “No doubt, we are facing severe cash crunch. We will bear it as the nation will be benefited in the long run as a result of weeding out of black money and counterfeit notes,” says a farmer leader, Jagarlamudi Anil Babu, from the rice-rich Karamchedu village. With only Rs. 2,000 notes made available in banks, there is a huge shortage of notes in Rs. 100 and Rs. 50 denomination needed to make payments to farm workers and purchase of farm inputs. “We have found a solution to the persistent problem by deferring payments to farm workers and paying partly in the form of rice,” he says. “We have started paying the workers partly in the form of rice and stand guarantee to small loans extended to them by the local grocery shops to buy other essential commodities,” says Palaparthi Srinivasa Rao, a farmer from Nagulapupadu. The trust they enjoy with suppliers of farm inputs have ensured uninterrupted supply of pesticides to their farms on credit. “The fertiliser dealers also oblige us by accepting scrapped Rs. 500 and Rs.1,000 notes,” says another farmer, G.Veeraragavalu from Chadalavada. “With no access to institutional credit, tenant farmers, who are mainly depend upon private money lenders, faced difficulty in raising capital for the rabi crop,” says Kuvulu Rythu Sangam State secretary N. Ranga Rao. The farmers needed about Rs. 3,200 crore in cash, particularly lower denomination of Rs. 50 and Rs. 100 notes to pay farm workers and complete the harvest of khariff crop in about 40 lakh hectares in the State without any hassles, according to YSRC farmers’ wing State president N.V.S. Nagi Reddy. He wants the Central and State governments to release crop loans sanctioned for growers on a top priority basis to go for Bengal gram and other crops in 25 lakh hectares during the rabi season.

Speaking to the media persons, he said the co-operative banking sector was the worst-hit as the availability of money made was less. “Co-operative banking sector is the backbone of the rural India and the Banking Regulation Act that govern the commerical banks is applicable to it. Now that the khariff season has ended, the farmers have no money to give to the farm hands. To raise the second crop they have no money to buy seed, pesticides and fertilizers,” he said. He blamed the Centre for its ham-handed executing of demonetisation exercise and felt that more number of Rs. 500 and Rs. 100 notes must have been available to the public. “Releasing Rs. 2,000 is a big mistake. No one is giving change for Rs. 2,000 and for the past 12 days people across India are suffering. The badly hit are those in the lower section of the society,” he said. He felt corruption cannot be stopped even after the initiative. “It is an open secret that in all public works and projects, kickbacks up to 5 and 7 per cent were being paid.” Citing an example at Amaravati, he said while per acre at the capital city was around Rs. 4 crore, the government was doling out land for the corporate sector for a paltry Rs. 50 lakh.

547,2016-11-21,14.0,"Mamata targets Modi, to hit Delhi streets against demonetisation","West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee at a press conference at Chief Minister's office at Nabanna, Howrah on Monday.
  West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee on Monday alleged that Prime Minister Narendra Modi was threatening other parties raising voices against demonetisation and said she would hit the streets of Delhi tomorrow to protest against the Centre’s move which caused immense hardship to the people. “The Prime Minister is threatening other parties who are raising their voices on demonetisation. PM should be sober. PM should behave like a PM. If necessary, he should convene an all-party meeting on the issue,” Ms. Banerjee told a press conference at the state secretariat. “There is no ego fight. There should be a plan of action on demonetisation. My humble submission is that let us work together to solve the issue. The people are suffering,” the Trinamool Congress supremo said. Claiming that some political parties were unable to raise their voices because the “PM is threatening them”, she said, “But I will not be cowed down. I will continue to protest. He can put me in jail. He (Modi) is even threatening his own party.” Mr. Modi at a rally in Agra yesterday said that political leaders behind multi-crore chit fund scams were attacking him because they had been hit hard by demonetisation, indirectly referring to Mamata Banerjee. Alleging that there was a ‘scam’ behind this move, she said, “There must be some hidden agenda. What is the hidden agenda? Let them bring it to the public domain,” she said. Ms. Banerjee said that she would hit the streets in Delhi on Tuesday and visit other states also on this issue. “I will be in Delhi on November 23,24 and in Lucknow on November 29. I will also go to Bihar and Punjab,” she announced. “This is not a political issue. We are speaking on behalf of commoners. Markets are closed. Small traders are hit,” she remarked and said “I have no personal interest. I am doing this for the sake of the people of the country“. She said that she was not alone in her fight and added at least three other parties had gone with her to the President. “I will request all (opposition) political parties to be with the people”, she said. The Chief Minister said that the Centre is allowing demonetised notes in various sectors like railways, aviation, petroleum, etc. but not for state government sectors.

The Opposition asserted that no discussion on demonetisation would take place till the House mourns the nearly 70 deaths caused by hardships due to the withdrawal of higher denomination currency notes. While Congress, BSP, TMC and CPI(M) among others wanted a resolution condoling the deaths to come from the Chair, Leader of the House and Finance Minister Arun Jaitley charged the Opposition of running away from the demonetisation debate. Slogan-shouting opposition members rushed into the well of the House, forcing Deputy Chairman P.J. Kurien to first adjourn the proceedings till 1130 hours and then again till noon. “Why are they (opposition parties) running away from debate,” Jaitley asked. “This is clear now that the opposition is not ready for debate and is coming up with new excuses to disrupt the House.” Stating that the notice for suspension of business under Rule 267 was accepted on first day of the winter session and a debate had started, he said the reported deaths could come up during the course of this debate and the reply to it. No sooner that the House mourned the death of 130 persons in the derailment of Indore-Patna Express near Kanpur yesterday, Sitaram Yechury (CPI0-M) said an obituary reference condoling the death of 70 people due to hardships caused by the demonetisation should be moved by the Chair. He was supported by Mayawati (BSP) who said people have died standing in queues because of hunger, want of medicines and waiting for currency for marriage. Leader of the Opposition Ghulam Nabi Azad (Cong) said while condolences have been expressed for those killed in yesterday’s train accident, the same should be done for the 70 people who have lost their lives in last 15 days. “They are also citizens of this country. We want such an obituary reference to come from the Chair,” he said, adding that Prime Minister Narenda Modi should also come to the House for the debate. Kurien said if the members were ready, the discussion on demonetisation issue can resume immediately. “I would like to make it very clear that the Chair is ready for discussion if you are ready,” he said. Stating that 11 bank employees were among the 70 who lost their lives, Yechury asked the Chair to take the opinion of the House on moving a resolution condoling their death. He said the debate could be held after the obituary reference is made by the Chair. Kurien however virtually ruled it out saying “condolences are not done on demand. That has to come spontaneously. You can approach the Chairman (on that).” To this, Yechury said “take consensus of the House”. At this point, opposition Congress, BSP and TMC members rushed into the Well shouting slogans. “Narendra Modi sharam karo, sharam karo (shame on Narendra Modi)”, “Modi sadan mein jawab do (Modi please reply in the House)”, “poonjiwadio ki yeh sarkar nahi chalegi (this government of capitalists will not be tolerated)”, “Jan virodhi Narendra Modi sharma karo, sharam karo (shame on anti-people Narendra Modi),” they shouted. TMC members carried placards with “Financial Emergency” written. Kurien then adjourned the proceedings till 1130 hours. Second adjournment No sooner did Deputy Chairman Kurien occupy the Chair and call Dilip Tirkey (BJD) to start his Zero Hour mention, Congress members trooped into the Well. Kurien suggested that members could continue the discussion on demonetisation of currency, but Congress members kept shouting slogans and other opposition members were seen standing on the aisles. Amid din, Minister of State for Parliamentary Affairs Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi too pitched for continuation of the debate. “Many members want to speak (on the demonetisation),” he said. Yechury (CPI-M) again asked the Chair for an obituary reference for those who died while standing in queues outside banks due to the demonetisation move. Kurien said there is a procedure for such references and suggested that the members to approach Rajya Sabha Chairman. “What is the authenticity of numbers (of dead) you are speaking,” he said, adding that obituary references cannot be taken up suo motu. As Naqvi pressed for continuation of the debate on currency notes, the vociferous protests continued while BJP members kept shouting “We want discussion. We want discussion”. Kurien then adjourned the House till noon. Third adjournment As soon as House met at noon for the Question Hour, Opposition members again rose from their seats and started shouted slogans over demonetisation of currency. Rajya Sabha Chairman Hamid Ansari asked the members to let the Question Hour continue, but the Opposition did not relent. Members including those from the Congress, TMC and BSP were seen standing along their seats with many of them shouting slogans. Following the din in the House, Ansari adjourned the proceedings for the third time on Monday for 30 minutes. When Rajya Sabha reassembled at 1234 hours, Opposition members rose from their seats raising slogans over the demonetisation issue. Ansari tried to pacify the members so that the Question Hour could be taken up but his efforts were futile.

When Rajya Sabha reassembled at 1234 hours, Opposition members rose from their seats raising slogans over the demonetisation issue. Ansari tried to pacify the members so that the Question Hour could be taken up but his efforts were futile. Members including those from the Congress, TMC and BSP were seen standing along their seats and several were seen shouting anti-government slogans. Amidst the din, Naqvi shouted “the sense of the country is against black money. Sense of the country is in favour of Prime Minister Narendra Modi“. As the uproar continued, the House was adjourned till 1400 hours.

  There is likely to be no let up in Opposition’s protest over the demonetisation issue in the second week of the Winter Session of Parliament. At a meeting of opposition parties this morning, it was decided that they will continue to press for an adjournment motion on demonetisation amid suggestions that House may begin discussions under a separate rule which does not entail voting and moving a formal motion. “The meeting at the outset noted with concern the insensitivity of the government regarding the train accident. On an earlier occasion, the Prime Minister had rushed to an accident site in Kerala. But on Sunday he was in Agra and did not go to the site,” said CPI(M) leader Mohd Salim. He said the opposition would also press for an obituary and adjournment of proceedings as a mark of respect for the people who are said to have died standing in queues at banks and ATMs victims. Leader of Congress in Lok Sabha Mallikarjun Kharge agreed that there is no precedent but added that the opposition would still press for it. He also said the opposition may organise a dharna on the issue of demonetisation at Mahatma Gandhi’s statue outside Parliament House but a final call could be taken this evening or tomorrow. Discussions also took place on meeting the President after the dharna, but no final decision could be arrived at. “The PM can speak on Cold Play but not address the Opposition on demonetisation, demands for a JPC on (alleged) leakage of demonetisation information to some corporates and deaths of people standing in queue to get money from banks and ATMs,” said Mr. Salim.

554,2016-11-21,14.0,?Never seen such a crisis like demonetisation?,"N Chandrababu Naidu
 
| Photo Credit: K_R_DEEPAK Chief Minister N. Chandrababu Naidu on Sunday made no bones about the tardy progress in providing relief to people facing multitude of problems arising from demonetisation of Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,000 currency notes. “I never came across a crisis that could not be solved for so many days in my entire political career,” he said in a teleconference with officials and bankers from his residence here. The State government could tide over the Hudhud cyclone impact and restore normalcy in just eight days. It was on high alert following a setback on the first day of the Godavari pushkarams ensuring the event went off smoothly thereafter. It was unfortunate the problems of demonetisation had remained unsolved even after 12days, he said. “I myself feel impatient over the predicament. Despite all hardships, the people are exhibiting patience and endurance. Really, we need to appreciate it.” The bankers and the finance department officials should get up and go. “It is time the people got their much needed relief from cash crunch.” Exchange of old currency and non-availability of sufficient small denomination notes were impacting all walks of life, including the poor and the rich. The bankers must see the crisis as an opportunity and prove their efficiency. It was time to meet the expectations of the public and work overcoming rules and regulations, he said. “Address every complaint received at the command control room.” The banks also need to set up call centres to reach out to the consumers and address their grievances. They can use the available infrastructure and resources. They can also depute senior officials who can guide the staffers and the public in the right direction in every district. They would have to assess the cash requirements in every district for effective monitoring and see that rural areas would not suffer due to cash crunch, he said. Mr. Naidu said the Reserve Bank had dispatched Rs. 2,000 crore worth currency to the State. Of this, Rs. 100 notes amounted to Rs. 400 crore. So, there was a possibility that the people would have some respite. Special Chief Secretary (Finance) Ajeya Kallam, DGP N. Sambasiva Rao, RBI GM Subbaiah and others were present at the teleconference. The Chief Minister would convene a special State Level Bankers Committee (SLBC) meeting on Monday to take stock of the situation.

555,2016-11-21,14.0,"People clueless on smaller notes, currency-dispensing fuel stations","TIRUPATI: There is a lot of confusion among the people now with regard to the prevailing situation on exchange of scrapped notes and release of new currency notes, which is attributed to the lack of communication. People are clueless on the fate of the new Rs.500 notes that are yet to be received by the banks, the swipe-accepting fuel stations and the latest status on indelible ink. With the demonetisation having sucked the Rs.500 and Rs.1,000 notes from the market, the RBI was expected to infuse fresh stock of currency in the lower denominations in its place immediately. While the Rs.2,000 notes have saturated the market, the new Rs.500 notes are yet to arrive, leaving the people scurrying for small change. The retail market, which has been reeling under the currency crisis, has in the last couple of days felt agitated. “The people have so far been cooperative with us. But, the inflow of Rs.10, Rs.50 and Rs.100 denomination notes by Monday is quite essential to prevent them from turning restive,” a bank manager said on condition of anonymity. Admittedly, the bankers are also in a fix as to when the currency notes would arrive or at which level they have reached. Though the Centre announced that the public can swipe and get currency notes in 'some' fuel stations, people are not sure about their location. As expected, every fuel station turned its back to the public citing non-availability of smaller change. Similar is the dilemma with indelible ink and the current status on its usage, after the Election Commission cautioned the RBI. On Saturday, which was kept open for senior citizens, a bank in Tirupati reportedly denied exchange of old notes, citing non-availability of indelible ink.

556,2016-11-21,14.0,Demonetisation badly implemented: Jogi,"RAIPUR: Former Chhattisgarh Chief Minister and Chhattisgarh Janata Congress (CJC) chief Ajit Jogi on Sunday criticised Prime Minister Narendra Modi for the ‘badly-implemented’ decision of demonetisation. “The PM thought that he will go down in the history as someone who got rid of black money. But now he will go down in the history as someone who was not fit to be the Prime Minister of the country, and who did not realise the meaning of demonetisation,” Mr. Jogi, who is now wheelchair-bound, told The Hindu. He also said the decision of demonetising the now outdated Rs. 500 and Rs. 100 currency notes was taken with an eye on upcoming assembly elections in Uttar Pradesh and Punjab. “The objective [of demonetisation] could have been achieved by planning its implementation in a better manner. When they [Bharatiya Janata Party] realised that they could not recover the NPAs [Non Performing Assets] from industrialists, they thought that they would recover it from the common public. You have restricted co-operative banks from changing notes. It is becoming difficult for farmers and common people in the rural area to manage the day to day life,” Mr. Jogi claimed. He also said that the move would damage the BJP in the upcoming elections. “ The common public will find it difficult to forget this as they had to stand in queues for hours [to get] their own money. There is hardly any way to deal with it apart from a partial rollback or some concessions, at least in rural areas, ” he added. Tribal deaths in Bastar When asked about the current situation in Bastar region of Chhattisgarh and the alleged extra-judicial killings of tribals, Mr. Jogi said the controversial officer, under whose watch the alleged excesses are happening, was “once very close to him.” “Even Narendra Modi and [Chhattisgarh] Chief Minister Raman Singh have no control over the administration in Bastar. The majority of the encounters are false and fake, and 75 per cent of those who are surrendering as Maoists are common people. If this continues, we will never be able to get rid of Maoist insurgency in Bastar. I always believe that there will be officers who will go their own way if the political leadership fails to control them; the government’s approach [in Bastar] is totally wrong,” Mr. Jogi told The Hindu.

557,2016-11-21,14.0,Currency crisis: Farmers worry ahead of harvest season,"Farmers in some parts of Kabini command area in the district are wondering how to pay labourers who come to harvest their paddy crop (in the irrigated area) in the aftermath of the currency crisis. With most banks dispensing only Rs. 2,000 notes with a limit on withdrawal, farmers are in a state of worry with no sufficient low-value cash available for making the payments. The impact could have been more if the agriculture season in the district was good and the areas had not been under the grip of drought, they feel. “Already, traders from neighbouring States have cut down purchase of vegetables owing to the cash crunch. Also, prices of most vegetables have fallen. Though the long-term benefits of demonetisation could be more, farmers are not spared from the immediate impact of the move,” Kurubur Shanthakumar, president, Karnataka Sugarcane Growers’ Association, said. Mr. Shanthakumar, also a sugarcane and paddy grower, told The Hindu that farmers are unable to go to banks for either cash exchange or withdrawal ahead of the harvest season. In some places, vegetables have remained unsold with traders not buying the produce for want of cash. Some farmers don’t have the money to buy fertilizers for their standing crop. All this have impacted the price of farmers’ produce, he said. Devaraj, a farmer from Attahalli in Bannur hobli, said farmers may face cash crunch when the paddy crop comes for the harvest. It may not be a problem for farmers with big land holdings, but will be an issue for those with small land holdings who cannot afford to go for harvester machines. “I myself had a few old Rs. 500 notes. But I could not go to the bank for exchange because of rush and work in the fields. Difficulty in getting the change for Rs. 2,000 has also affected the day-to-day work,” he said. Mr. Devaraj, however, hoped that the situation would ease by next week when paddy growers turn busy for the harvest season. “By and large, harvest of most crops is over ... otherwise the impact would have been more with lack of cash for payments to farm workers,” he added. While welcoming the Union government’s move for a special withdrawal provision for farmers, Mr. Devaraj said many farmers in his area feel that crunch might ease only when the new Rs. 500 currency was made available.

558,2016-11-21,14.0,Opportunity to convert stashed currency into white,"Demonetisation has badly affected several businessmen but some are finding opportunities to make profitable ‘loan deals’ out of it. Both the borrowers and lenders are at an advantage in these new agreements albeit they are happening only between persons known to each other. Plywood shop owner Sriram (name changed) from Suchitra bus-stop area had been looking out for loan of nearly Rs. 50 lakh to meet his business expansion plans. He burnt his fingers earlier having borrowed money at high interest rate for investment in the business. Though returns on investment in plywood and interior decoration items are good, high interest rate ate off major chunk of his profit. Ban of high value currency notes affected him like many other businessmen. While insufficient availability of currency notes of smaller denomination brought down his daily turnover, business expansion plan almost fell flat with financiers struggling to transform their unaccounted sums into ‘white money’. Interestingly, a casual meeting with one such financier struggling for ideas on what to do with the huge sums of cash he possessed. “Bhai saab, give that one crore rupees to me without demanding any interest. I will start paying you back after some six months,” he proposed. No financier would have agreed to that but the repeated advisories from the Government that persons hoarding money had to face the music compelled him to agree to Sriram’s plan. Firstly, his black money would become white and the customer was reliable. All that he would lose is the interest. That too not more than six months or at the most a year. “Unaccounted sum would become official. No need to bother about exchanging old currency. Above all, it is a great escape for tax related tangles,” he said. The only problem in the deal was he would get his money back on installment basis. Out of the Rs 1 crore, Sriram decided to clear his debt of Rs. 50 lakh he had borrowed from others earlier. “Not just me. Many are entering into such deals,” he said citing some more such deals he had knowledge of. Both the borrower and lender are happy. For them, demonetisation is a blessing in disguise.

560,2016-11-21,14.0,Farmers of Malnad region grappling with after effects of demonetisation,"With paucity of cash to pay labourers for harvesting work and the decline in the price of agriculture produce, farmers in rural areas of Malnad region are grappling with the after effects of demonetisation of Rs. 1,000 and Rs. 500 notes. It may be mentioned here that immediately after the announcement of demonetisation, the prices of arecanut registered a slump by around 10 percent in the Shivamogga market. Arecanut trading had come to a standstill from November 10 to 17. Though the trading of arecanut has resumed, no improvement in the price can be seen. Decline in yield There was decline in the yield of arecanut in the region this year owing to moisture stress caused by drought prevalent from the past two years. Tirthappa, a farmer from Holalur village near here, said that arecanut prices were expected to escalate owing to a decline in the yield. It is unfortunate that owing to demonetisation, there has been sharp decline in the price. The decline is attributed to confusion at multiple levels, including at firms engaged in making products from arecanut and owners of local mandis, on making payments for purchases following demonetisation. Maize and paddy Not only arecanut, the prices of maize and paddy have also declined owing to demonetisation. The centres involved in procuring paddy have not yet commenced functioning in the district. The price of paddy that was at Rs. 1,600 per quintal and had declined to around Rs 1,500 after demonetisation. The price of maize has fallen to around Rs. 1,310 from Rs. 1,400 per quintal. Yogish, a farmer from Anavatti village said that middlemen, who purchase produce from the doorsteps of farmers, are citing paucity of cash as the reason for the decline in the price. He said that the government should immediately commence the procurement of agriculture produce at minimum support price to arrest the decline in the prices. Tankachan Andrews, who is engaged in integrated farming in Ripponpet village near here, said that he had postponed the work of harvesting arecanut, ginger and tapping trees at his rubber plantation owing to the non-availability of cash to pay wages to labourers. Agricultural activities have faced serious setbacks owing to the restrictions on withdrawal of cash from banks. Banana Mr. Andrews said that he had even postponed the work of providing additional an dose of fertiliser to his banana plants. The shops engaged in selling agricultural inputs are not accepting demonetised currency. The delay in providing additional dosage of fertiliser will affect the yield of banana. Withdrawal limits In the wake of commencement of harvesting activities, farmers should be exempted from the weekly withdrawal limits of Rs. 24,000 from savings accounts, he said.

561,2016-11-21,14.0,Farming community struggling to cope with demonetisation in Hassan,"Lakshman, a ginger grower, has delayed the harvest of his crop as there are no buyers.   The withdrawal of high denomination notes has severely affected cash flow in the district, leaving the farming community in dire straits. Farmers, who already marketed their kharif harvest, cannot spend the cash they have earned to prepare the ground for rabi cultivation, while the rest are not finding traders to purchase their produce. Many ginger growers have left their produce on the farmland, waiting to sell at a suitable price. Similarly, maize growers have delayed the harvest hoping that the situation will get better soon. Steep fall in price Rajaiah, of Boovanahalli in Hassan taluk, has cultivated maize. “No merchants are buying maize as they do not have cash. Besides this, the price has also come down in the market as there is no cash flow. After the demonetisation came into effect, the price of maize came down by Rs. 1,700 to Rs. 1,350 per quintal, within a few days,” he said. Harvest postoned Similar is the case of ginger growers. Many of them have decided to leave the yield in the field for some more time, hoping that the situation will improve soon. Lakshman, of Shantigrama village, has grown ginger in his two-acre farm. The yield is ready for harvest, but he has delayed it. “The price of ginger has come down in the last eight days from Rs.1,200 per bag to Rs.900 per bag of 62 kgs,” he said. The delay in harvest will have adverse effects. Kanagal Murthy, a maize grower at Dodda Kanagal in Alur taluk, said even if it rained for a day, the standing crop would go waste. Like him, many are finding it difficult to arrange for labourers for harvest as there is no cash on hand to pay them. The farmers who delay the harvest of ginger also face the loss, as tubers become dry and lose weight. “I have been providing sufficient water to the ginger tubers so that weight is not lost,” said Lakshman. However, not every ginger grower can afford the luxury of watering the tubers for a long period. The farmers, who sold their products early, are not getting cash for household expenses or for preparations for rabi cultivation. They have had to deposit cash in their accounts as they had received cash in the old currency.

As in most of the estates, their family gets a weekly advance of Rs. 1,200 and a salary at the end of the month. “We have not been paid the advance for the last two weeks in cash,” Anand told The Hindu. The estate manager informed the workers that the advance of Rs. 1,200 had been credited to their bank accounts (Jan Dhan accounts). “When I went to the bank, I was told that as only Rs.1,200 was in the account, I could not withdraw it. The officials at the bank said they did not have smaller currency to give us Rs.1,200. I need to withdraw a minimum of Rs. 2,000. For this, I will have to wait for one more week,” he said. For the last two weeks, Anand, who has two children, has received no payment. This is situation hundreds of workers in the estates are facing. They have been purchasing grocery and vegetables from shopkeepers on loan. Anand said he did ask the estate manager for cash and was told that owners did not have any cash. “The estate managers do not have cash to distribute among the workers. When we insist on cash, they tell us to take our demands to Prime Minister Narendra Modi instead,” he said.

564,2016-11-21,14.0,Demonetisation: SCB realises a fifth of its annual revenue,"The Secunderabad Cantonment Board has realised more than a fifth of its annual revenue in the last ten days alone, thanks to the demonetisation decision. The board raked in over Rs. 6 crore, largely in property tax, after it decided to accept payments in Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,000 currency notes. The SCB began accepting the demonetised currency on November 11. Officials say that they expect more revenue in the coming days. “A large chunk of the payments are from those who had not paid earlier. After an initial dilemma over whether the old notes should be accepted or not, we began the collections,” informed an SCB official. SCB’s revenue collection has increased in the recent years, mainly through revision of property tax rates and stringent collection norms. However, the collection has remained well below Rs. 50 crore, though talk of a potential Rs. 100 crore collection is common. With four more days to go before the deadline for acceptance of old notes elapses, taxmen are hopeful of more revenue collection. The SCB’s collection of toll tax at the entry and exit points is now being questioned as the Centre has exempted toll payment till November 24. A former ward member, Jai Prakash, made a representation to the SCB asking for exemption. When contacted, an SCB official, on condition of anonymity, said the toll collection was exempted on the highway, but at other entry and exit points of the SCB, it continues to be collected. It was also informed that toll collection has reduced by more than 30 per cent as the transport sector has been affected by lack of currency.

565,2016-11-21,14.0,"Currency crunch hits farmers, labourers","A few days ago, Pullikar, a labourer hailing from Assam and working in a farm land in Belthangady, got Rs. 9,000 as wages from the land owner. Three days ago, she went to the post office near Mogaru village and sent Rs. 6,000 as money order to her family in Assam. Though the money has reached them, the family members have not been able to encash it because of shortage of currency, said Dinakar Gowda, the land owner. He said the bank in his village has gone for a token system to issue cash. “It issues 130 tokens a day,” he said. Ramesh Kaintaje, a farmer from Mani, said shortage of Rs. 50 and Rs. 100 notes in his village has not only hit farm labourers but also farmers. “A farm labourer quarrelled with my neighbour last week because he could get only Rs. 300 of the Rs. 660 due to him,” he said. Harvesting affected “Arecanut harvesting season has begun. A skilled harvester of arecanut demands Rs. 1,000 a day. In addition, a farmer has to pay at least one or two assistant labourers. Non-availability of Rs. 500 and Rs. 100 notes has aggravated the problem, resulting in delay in harvesting,” he said. “Last week, I visited a bank in Puttur thrice to get Rs. 12,000 for paying labourers.” “If farmers sell arecanut to co-operative societies, they are making payment in cheque and not cash. If we go to the bank for encashing the cheques, we are not getting the full amount because of shortage of cash,” he said. Ravikirana Punacha, another farmer from near Vitla, said that many private arecanut traders have either stopped purchase of arecanut or are making use of the low prices quoted now. A private trader recently quoted Rs. 220 for a kg of old arecanut (single chol), instead of prevailing rate of Rs. 260,” he said. Manohar Shetty, a farmer from Kuppepadavu, said the impact of shortage of currency in his village has not been felt much now as a nationalised bank has notes of Rs. 10 and Rs. 50 denominations. “There was scarcity a week ago, but not now,” he said.

  Like bank employees, fuel outlet attendants too have had a harrowing time these past few days since people come to them with notes of large denominations. Many of them said their patience was exhausted talking to customers who were often rude in their demand for change. “Most of the middle class customers have exhausted their Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,000 notes and are bringing in Rs. 2,000 notes. If they tank up for Rs. 1,000, we are forced to give them Rs. 1,000 in change and that would mean ten notes of Rs. 100, which is just not possible,” said a fuel pump attendant. Fuel outlet managers said they were not getting enough change from banks though they knew their sales volume was high. “We easily require around Rs. 30,000 in notes of Rs. 100 a day. But we get notes for only Rs. 5,000-Rs. 6,000 and that too from other customers. Some people wait for a few minutes so that we can get Rs. 100 notes when others pay. But some others just refuse to wait and they also don’t tell us they have only notes of higher denominations. We cannot take back the petrol just because we don’t have change,” said an outlet manager. Added to this is the recent announcement that cash can be withdrawn using electronic data capturing machines. These are outlets that are linked with State Bank of India accounts and debit cards can be used. However, customers do not realise that only a few outlets have such facilities. “On Saturday, we had a tough time telling people they can’t withdraw cash at our outlet since we don’t bank with SBI. What we do at present is withdraw cash from our current account by cheque and the amount gets credited to our account the next day. However, on Sunday, none of the fuel outlets dispensed cash as banks were closed,” said a dealer. Officials of Bharat Petroleum Corporation said that talks were on to tie up with other banks to dispense cash.

Although they had sold the produce to the traders or agents from the adjoining Salem district, they could not do any transaction due to demonetisation of Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,000 currency notes. According to these farmers they are forced to come down from the hills to the plains at Uppliyapuram or Shobanapuram to get their currency exchanged. Most farmers possessed currency notes in the high value denomination. Residents of Pachamalai told The Hindu on Sunday that they had to run from pillar to post to get their old currencies exchanged. One of the residents K. Murugesan, said that though the farmers relied on post offices, the quantum of currencies exchanged was far less and was too inadequate to meet their expenses.

To get back whatever they had invested on the crop, growers with small land holdings have started direct sale of their produce along the main roads, highways, hobli headquarters, and towns. Such scenes are becoming common, especially on the outskirts of Mysuru, with the produce being carried in goods vehicles to reach out to buyers. Beans, tomato, brinjal, cabbage and other major vegetables are prominently sold and offered at a price less than the market price. “Growers have no other option but to go for direct marketing ... otherwise the crop will rot with not many traders coming forward to buy the produce,” a farmer leader said. In places such as K.G. Koppal, growers, using public address system, market their produce and this measure seems to have worked for them.

  The normal business at the weekly ‘santhais’ in the rural areas in the districts of Salem and Namakkal remained crippled for the second consecutive week, thanks to the shortage of lower denomination currency. The ‘santhais’ used to be overflowing with traders, mainly the farmers, and consumers from across the districts every week. The weekly cattle ‘santhais’ in these two districts which attract a large number of traders from the neighbouring states of Karnataka, Kerala and Andhra Pradesh have also been affected. The ‘santhai’ at Konganapuram near Edappadi, which meets on Saturdays, is a major cattle market of the western region. Every week, about 5,000 goats are brought here from the surrounding villages and all were sold out instantly for good price. On Saturday, only 2,000 goats were in the market and they too were quoted very lesser price compared to the previous occasions. “The present scenario is something unprecedented which we have not witnessed in the last many decades”, laments S. Marisamy, a 65-year-old farmer of Konganapuram. The Sinna Tirupathi weekly ‘santhai,’ about 20 km from Omalur town, is another major market of the district. The market which met on Saturday did not attract many consumers. The farmers who had brought the cattle in the morning left in huff within a couple of hours with the cattle, due to the absence of any trader to purchase them. “We have not witnessed such a poor scenario in the ‘santhai’ in many years. This is something peculiar. It will take a long time for the normal situation to return”, says Pakkiam, who had put up a vegetable stall in the ‘santhai’. Taramangalam ‘santhai’ near Salem city which met on Thursdays is another major weekly market. The traders complain that there were no takers even for the regular grocery items and vegetables, which were not very costly. Similar is the case in other weekly markets too in Salem and Namakkal districts. The business and the weekly auctions of copra, plantain, cotton, turmeric, too have been affected due to shortage of currency with the trading community. The copra auction at Paramathivelur regulated market was cancelled for the past two weeks, due to poor traders turn up.

  The demonetisation of Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,000 notes has left scores of England tourists and cricket fans stumped as they find themselves in a tight spot now. “We have been making endless visits to the ATMs from the past couple of days, but at most places there’s no cash. In fact, we took out Rs. 10,000 in the denominations of Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,000 just the day the demonetisation news broke. Now, we are stuck with several notes which are useless,” said Rebecca Honeycone from Canterbury, a cathedral city in southeast England. Rebecca is in Visakhapatnam with her husband Phillip to cheer the England cricket team as part of her India tour itinerary which began from October this year. “Our everyday expenses have escalated way beyond what we planned. We had to upgrade from homestays to bigger hotels which accept credit cards. If we go to see any tourist monument, the fee for a foreign tourist is Rs. 500 but nobody is accepting the Rs. 500 notes as a result we had to skip several such tourist places because we are guarding whatever little lower denomination notes we are left with for emergency needs,” said Phillip, her husband. “Some banks refused to entertain us as we are foreigners. Tomorrow we head to Hyderabad and there again will begin a next chapter for the hunt of Rs. 100 notes!” quipped Rebecca. There are hundreds of England cricket fans, who currently in Visakhapatnam and on an India tour, including the organised cricket fan groups like the Barmy Army that are often termed as the England team’s unofficial 12th man. Most of them said that they were facing problems as they mostly have the old Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,000 notes or are given Rs. 2,000 notes at airport forex counters. In Visakhapatnam, like in many other Indian cities, majority of ATMs are still not functioning properly. Oliver Terry from Nottingham, England, who was enjoying the cricket match on Sunday with several other England fans said: “Hotels and bars are the only places where we are finding change for Rs. 2,000 notes. We are buying beer cans and food collectively as a group for a high value bill. We have also noticed that most of the local vendors and stores are not willing to part with change.” “If we want to go out and see some tourist place, we cannot go as the taxi driver or autorickshaws are demanding new currency notes or money in lower denomination ,” said John, another England cricket fan. Andrew Gosden from Lymington Hampshire said that this time he may have to disappoint his friends and family members back home as he doesn’t have enough lower denomination currencies to purchase souvenirs. “It is Christmas season for us and obviously my family will be eagerly waiting for me to get them some Indian souvenirs. But I am finding it tough to get change for the souvenirs in the local shops in cities,” he added.

  Farmers in some parts of Kabini command area in the district are wondering how to pay the labourers who come to harvest their paddy crop (in the irrigated areas) in the aftermath of the currency crisis. With most banks dispensing only Rs. 2,000 notes and with a limit on withdrawal, farmers are in a state of worry as they don’t have enough low denomination notes to make the payments. The impact would have been more if the agricultural season in the district was good and the areas had not been under the grip of drought, they felt. “Already, traders from neighbouring States have cut down on the purchase of vegetables owing to the cash crunch. Also, prices of most vegetables have fallen. Though the long-term benefits of demonetisation could be more, farmers are not spared from the immediate impact of the move,” Kurubur Shanthakumar, president, Karnataka Sugarcane Growers’ Association, said. Mr. Shanthakumar, also a sugarcane and paddy grower, told The Hindu that farmers are unable to go to banks to exchange cash and withdraw money ahead of the harvest season. In some places, vegetables have remained unsold with traders not buying the produce for want of cash. Some farmers don’t have the money to buy fertilizers for their standing crop. All these have impacted the price of farmers’ produce, he said. Devaraj, a farmer from Attahalli in Bannur hobli, said farmers may face cash crunch when the paddy crop comes for harvest. It may not be a problem for farmers with big land holdings, but will be an issue for those with small land holdings who cannot afford to go for harvester machines. “I myself had a few old Rs. 500 notes. But I could not go to the bank for exchange because of the rush and work in the fields. Difficulty in getting the change for Rs. 2,000 has also affected day-to-day work,” he said. Mr. Devaraj, however, hoped that the situation would ease by next week when paddy growers become busy for the harvest season. “By and large, harvest of most crops is over ... otherwise the impact would have been more owing to the lack of cash to pay farm workers,” he added. While welcoming the Union government’s move for a special withdrawal provision for farmers, Mr. Devaraj said many farmers in his area feel that the crunch might ease only when the new Rs. 500 currency is made available.

On Sunday, a delegation of traders held a meeting with Mr. Thackeray to explain hardships being faced by the trading community. “Not only your generation, but even the next generation is going to suffer from this decision. Are you going to remain silent? Do not sit idle and shed tears. Be prepared to fight against this autocratic decision,” Mr. Thackeray said. “He (Narendra Modi) was elected by the country’s 125-crore population, which was disillusioned with Congress rule. This population should have been taken into confidence before any such decision,” he said. Earlier, a delegation of traders held a meeting with the Sena chief, where he was informed that the trading business has taken a 70-per cent hit due to demonetisation. “Our business has come to a complete standstill. November and December are usually the best profit- making months for us, but demonetisation has completely changed the picture,” Viren Shah of the Federation of Retail Traders Welfare Association said after meeting. He added that the association has conveyed its problems to the Prime Minister in the past. “The government has taken the decision without adequate homework,” he said. Biren Lambichiya, another officer bearer of the association said that retail traders helped Mr Modi to achieve power. “But now he is taking steps against us,” he said. Despite these strong opinions from the trading community, the Sena chief chose to not speak against the move. When asked whether he supports traders’ demands, he point to other Sena leaders, asking them to speak.

574,2016-11-21,14.0,"People clueless on smaller notes, currency-dispensing fuel stations","There is a lot of confusion among the people now with regard to the situation on exchange of scrapped notes and release of new currency notes, which is attributed to the lack of communication. People are clueless on the fate of the new Rs.500 notes that are yet to be received by the banks, the swipe-accepting fuel stations and the latest status on indelible ink. With the demonetisation having sucked the Rs.500 and Rs.1,000 notes from the market, the RBI was expected to infuse fresh stock of currency in the lower denominations in its place immediately. While the Rs.2,000 notes have saturated the market, the new Rs.500 notes are yet to arrive, leaving the people scurrying for small change. The retail market, which has been reeling under the currency crisis, has in the last couple of days felt agitated. “The people have so far been cooperative with us. But, the inflow of Rs.10, Rs.50 and Rs.100 denomination notes by Monday is quite essential to prevent them from turning restive,” said a bank manager on condition of anonymity. Admittedly, the bankers are also in a fix when the currency notes would arrive or at which level they have reached. Though the Centre announced that the public can swipe and get currency notes in 'some' fuel stations, people are not sure about their location. As expected, every fuel station turned its back to the public citing non-availability of smaller change. Similar is the dilemma with indelible ink and the current status on its usage, after the Election Commission cautioned the RBI. On Saturday, which was kept open for senior citizens, a bank in Tirupati reportedly denied exchange of old notes, citing non-availability of indelible ink.

  Demonetisation has badly affected several businessmen but some are finding opportunities to make profitable ‘loan deals’ out of it. Both the borrowers and lenders are at an advantage in these new agreements albeit they are happening only between persons known to each other. Plywood shop owner Sriram (name changed) from Suchitra bus-stop area had been looking out for loan of nearly Rs. 50 lakh to meet his business expansion plans. He burnt his fingers earlier having borrowed money at high interest rate for investment in the business. Though returns on investment in plywood and interior decoration items are good, high interest rate ate off major chunk of his profit. Ban of high value currency notes affected him like many other businessmen. While insufficient availability of currency notes of smaller denomination brought down his daily turnover, business expansion plan almost fell flat with financiers struggling to transform their unaccounted sums into ‘white money’. Interestingly, a casual meeting with one such financier struggling for ideas on what to do with the huge sums of cash he possessed. “Bhai saab, give that one crore rupees to me without demanding any interest. I will start paying you back after some six months,” he proposed. No financier would have agreed to that but the repeated advisories from the Government that persons hoarding money had to face the music compelled him to agree to Sriram’s plan. Firstly, his black money would become white and the customer was reliable. All that he would lose is the interest. That too not more than six months or at the most a year. “Unaccounted sum would become official. No need to bother about exchanging old currency. Above all, it is a great escape for tax related tangles,” he said. The only problem in the deal was he would get his money back on installment basis. Out of the Rs 1 crore, Sriram decided to clear his debt of Rs. 50 lakh . “Not just me. Many are entering into such deals,” he said citing some more such deals he had knowledge of. Both the borrower and lender are happy.

The decision came as a bolt from the blue for the realty sector with construction activity almost coming to a standstill. The steel industry, already faced with tough challenges due to world-wide slump in the industry and dumping of cheap steel by China and the Commonwealth of Independent States, expects net losses during the third quarter. The jewellery and garment sector is also facing the heat. The famous jaggery market at Anakapalle has been temporarily shut down. With curbs on withdrawal of money from banks continuing, the crisis is expected to continue for another month or two. Sources say steel and cement sectors have witnessed almost 70 per cent fall in sales in the past few days. By and large, all the industrial managements welcomed Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s decision to declare a war on black money. At the same time, they think something is missing in implementing a contingency plan to cope with the situation. post-demonetisation. Net loss The Rashtriya Ispat Nigam Limited, corporate entity of the Visakhapatnam Steel Plant, recorded a net loss of Rs.1421 crore during 2015-16, first time after a gap of 13 years due to volatile market and flooding of domestic market with cheap steel. After demonetisation, its impact on construction sector will reduce the demand for steel for all the major producers including SAIL and JSW. “Steps are required to mitigate the currency crisis. Moreover the transformation from cash economy to banking economy and emphasis on use of digital transactions will bring into focus the demand for measures on cyber security,” said Confederation of Indian Industry zonal chairman V. Murali Krishna. He told The Hindu that on whole the decision on demonetisation was praiseworthy as it would paralyse the circulation of black money and terror funding.

579,2016-11-21,14.0,Demonetisation hits farmers of Malnad region,"With paucity of cash to pay labourers for harvesting work and the decline in the price of agriculture produce, farmers in rural areas of Malnad region are grappling with the after effects of demonetisation of Rs. 1,000 and Rs. 500 notes. It may be mentioned here that immediately after the announcement of demonetisation, the prices of arecanut registered a slump by around 10 percent in the Shivamogga market. Arecanut trading had come to a standstill from November 10 to 17. Though the trading of arecanut has resumed, no improvement in the price can be seen. Decline in yield There was decline in the yield of arecanut in the region this year owing to moisture stress caused by drought prevalent from the past two years. Tirthappa, a farmer from Holalur village near here, said that arecanut prices were expected to escalate owing to a decline in the yield. It is unfortunate that owing to demonetisation, there has been sharp decline in the price. The decline is attributed to confusion at multiple levels, including at firms engaged in making products from arecanut and owners of local mandis, on making payments for purchases following demonetisation. Maize and paddy Not only arecanut, the prices of maize and paddy have also declined owing to demonetisation. The centres involved in procuring paddy have not yet commenced functioning in the district. The price of paddy that was at Rs. 1,600 per quintal and had declined to around Rs 1,500 after demonetisation. The price of maize has fallen to around Rs. 1,310 from Rs. 1,400 per quintal. Yogish, a farmer from Anavatti village said that middlemen, who purchase produce from the doorsteps of farmers, are citing paucity of cash as the reason for the decline in the price. He said that the government should immediately commence the procurement of agriculture produce at minimum support price to arrest the decline in the prices. Tankachan Andrews, who is engaged in integrated farming in Ripponpet village near here, said that he had postponed the work of harvesting arecanut, ginger and tapping trees at his rubber plantation owing to the non-availability of cash to pay wages to labourers. Agricultural activities have faced serious setbacks owing to the restrictions on withdrawal of cash from banks. Banana plantation Mr. Andrews said that he had even postponed the work of providing additional an dose of fertiliser to his banana plants. The shops engaged in selling agricultural inputs are not accepting demonetised currency. The delay in providing additional dosage of fertiliser will affect the yield of banana. Withdrawal limits In the wake of commencement of harvesting activities, farmers should be exempted from the weekly withdrawal limits of Rs. 24,000 from savings accounts, he said.

It was unfortunate the problems of demonetisation had remained unsolved even after 12days, he said. “I myself feel impatient over the predicament. Despite all hardships, the people are exhibiting patience and endurance. Really, we need to appreciate it.” The bankers and the finance department officials should get up and go. “It is time the people got their much needed relief from cash crunch.” Exchange of old currency and non-availability of sufficient small denomination notes were impacting all walks of life, including the poor and the rich. The bankers must see the crisis as an opportunity and prove their efficiency. It was time to meet the expectations of the public and work overcoming rules and regulations, he said. “Address every complaint received at the command control room.” Rs. 2,000 crore worth currency The banks also need to set up call centres to reach out to the consumers and address their grievances. They can use the available infrastructure and resources. They can also depute senior officials who can guide the staffers and the public in the right direction in every district. They would have to assess the cash requirements in every district for effective monitoring and see that rural areas would not suffer due to cash crunch, he said. Mr. Naidu said the Reserve Bank had dispatched Rs. 2,000 crore worth currency to the State. Of this, Rs. 100 notes amounted to Rs. 400 crore. So, there was a possibility that the people would have some respite. Special Chief Secretary (Finance) Ajeya Kallam, DGP N. Sambasiva Rao, RBI GM Subbaiah and others were present at the teleconference. The Chief Minister would convene a special State Level Bankers Committee (SLBC) meeting on Monday to take stock of the situation.

  The little space outside Alam’s shanty, where he would relax after a long day of collecting household waste from door-to-door, is dotted with empty plastic bottles and metallic scrap. These heaps of plastic waste are only getting bigger with each passing day, as are the lines on Alam’s forehead. After repeatedly trying to call someone, the 20-year-old turns to his mother and says, “Phone abhi bhi band hai [the mobile phone is still switched off].” Shutting shop Most shops that deal in scrap near Seemapuri slums in north-east Delhi, which is where Alam lives with his family, have shut shop since Prime Minister Narendra Modi demonetised the Rs.1,000 and Rs.500 currency notes. The reason being that the scrap dealers have no change to pay for the waste plastic they buy from garbage collectors. Caught off-guard “The few shops that are open are buying it for half the price and forcing us to accept old notes. What do we do with these notes?” said Alam, the youngest of five siblings. The news of demonetisation took Alam and his family by surprise. Their immediate worry was the few thousand rupees they had saved over the past few years. A day after the announcement, Alam was among those who lined up outside a bank with Rs.10,000 in his pocket. “There was a huge rush. Like hundreds others, I skipped work and stood in a line to exchange the old notes. My turn didn’t come. I went again the next day and waited several hours, only to be told that I couldn’t get Rs.10,000 exchanged, and that I would have to deposit the money instead. I came back empty-handed as I don’t have an account,” he said. So demoralised were Alam and his family that they joined their neighbours in an impromptu protest. Reality, however, dawned on Alam the next day when he required the new currency to take care of his family’s daily expenses. His family includes two differently-abled nephews. Alam then met a bank employee, who told him that he could get Rs.4,000 exchanged at a time. “I reached the bank with a blanket at 8 p.m. and slept in the queue with several others. Next morning, I managed to get two Rs.2,000 notes,” he said with a smile. Short-lived joy But his happiness was short-lived. He was in for a shock when he reached the market the next day. “The shopkeepers refused to accept the new currency. They claimed not to have change. Ultimately, I had to buy a big sack of rice worth Rs.1,000 and get some grocery from another shop. Thankfully, I now have a few Rs.100 notes,” he said.

582,2016-11-21,14.0,Demonetisation woes continue,"The closure of banks, for the first time after demonetisation by the government, added to the woes of the public on Sunday. Customers were greeted by ‘not working’ boards at many of the ATMs, some ATMs downed their shutters, while others witnessed long queues. Long queues were seen at the ATMs of SBI at Dwaraka Nagar and Rednam Gardens on Sunday. The HDFC Bank ATM at Dwarakanagar also witnessed long line of customers while the ICICI ATMs at Madhavadhara and Dwarakanagar downed shutters. People were seen trying to exchange their Old High Denomination (OHD) notes at fuel stations. Small traders, fish vendors and the general public continued to face problems even after 12 days of the government’s decision on big notes. “Motorists have stopped coming for repairs unless they feel it absolutely important to go for immediate repairs. Some are bringing old Rs.500 notes for repairs costing Rs.100 or so and we cannot give them change,” said Tata Rao, a motorcycle mechanic, who has his shop beside Sankar Matham. “We are telling customers that if they give Rs.2000 note, the bill should be at least Rs.1600 or more. Our cash transactions dropped by around 50 per cent. On the positive side, however, we have noticed a quantum jump in card transactions,” said an employee of a restaurant near Diamond Park. Fall in fish sale There is a drastic fall in fish sales at the Nehru Bazaar. “Customers are giving Rs.2000 note for making purchases of Rs.200. This is for the first time that we are experiencing such a problem,” said Pydamma, who has been selling fish for the past 30 years. “We used to make sales to the tune of Rs.15,000 a day before demonetisation. Now we hardly make around Rs.5,000. You can estimate how much we are losing every day,” said Kodanda, another fish vendor. The fish market near RTC Complex presented a different picture with many vendors accepting OHD notes. It was a similar story at Fishing Harbour. The normally busy vendors were seen awaiting customers.

583,2016-11-21,14.0,"Demonetisation is to divert dissent of the public, says Ramakrishnan","G. RamakrishnanR_Shivaji Rao
  CPI (M) state secretary G. Ramakrishnan has said that the demonetisation exercise in its present form was not genuinely aimed at eradicating black money but only to divert the overall dissent of people on Union Government. “Considering the apparent hardships faced by the common man, the authorities should allow to use the now withdrawn Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,000 as legal tenders till December 30 before phasing them out. “The buffer period could be utilised to inject adequate replacement currencies into the system. At the same time, all other scrutiny procedures meant for monitoring of any unaccounted money flowing into the system can be continued up to December 30,” he told reporters here on Sunday. On why he felt that the present measures will not wipe out entire black money, Mr. Ramakrishnan claimed that according to the authentic studies, only six per cent of the black money generated in the country was stored in cash. “The remaining 94 per cent have been either stashed in banks abroad or invested in properties, gold, equities and other investment destinations. Similarly, the issue of counterfeit notes is also not at any worrisome levels to warrant any demonetisation exercise of the kind. A report of Indian Statistical Institute says that counterfeit notes comes to only 0.025 per cent of the legal currencies in circulation,” he contended. The CPI (M) leader wondered why the Union Government opted for such an exercise when it is not even listed among the eight steps suggested by the special investigation team (SIT) constituted for tackling black money. He asked why the Union Government, which shows much concern about wiping out black money, has waived off loans given to the corporate houses to the tune of Rs. 1,12,000 crore during 2014-15 fiscal. On the sufferings of the agrarian community due to the monetary curbs imposed on co-operative sector credit institutions post-monetisation, Mr. Ramakrishnan pointed out that agrarian community in the State had plunged into a predicament as they obtain nearly Rs 6,000 crore worth agriculture loans from these institutions. He appealed to the State Government to take steps to conduct civic body polls (stalled by the Madras High Court) at the earliest.

584,2016-11-22,15.0,Demonetisation?s positives unlikely to be strong: Fitch,"Fitch Ratings said on Tuesday the government’s decision on demonetisation that had created a cash crunch would constrain economic activities in the short-term forcing the credit rating agency to cut its GDP forecast for the fourth quarter. “The impact on GDP growth will increase the longer the disruption continues,” it said. Fitch also said benefits from the withdrawal of high-denomination currencies were unlikely to be enduring enough to result in a change in the outlook for India’s sovereign rating. Government revenue “The move has the potential to raise government revenue and encourage bank lending, but Fitch Ratings believes the positive effects are unlikely to be strong and sufficiently enduring to support credit profiles,” Fitch said in a statement. “Demonetisation is a one-off event. People that operate in the informal sector will still be able to use the new high-denomination bills and other options (like gold) to store their wealth. There are no new incentives for people to avoid cash transactions. The informal sector could soon go back to business as usual,” it said. On the impact of the move on the banking sector, Fitch said while banks would gain low-cost deposits, it remained to be seen whether the deposits would stay with banks beyond a few months. “The positive impact on funding conditions will depend on deposits remaining in banks beyond the next few months. There is nothing to prevent them being withdrawn again,” it said. reaffirming its negative outlook on the banking sector. Banks have received more than Rs.5 lakh crore since November 9. Asset quality “Demonetisation could also affect the ability of borrowers in sectors that rely on cash transactions to service their loans, with negative effects on bank asset quality, which is why the RBI has temporarily allowed banks to give small borrowers more time to repay loans.” Under-capitalisation of state-owned banks and weak investment demand were also among factors holding back lending, Fitch said.

585,2016-11-22,15.0,Steel flyover vs. demonetisation in Assembly,"The Legislative Assembly on Tuesday saw the Opposition BJP and the Congress choosing steel flyover and demonetisation issues, respectively, to politically outsmart each other. Irked over BJP member C.T. Ravi’s remarks that the government has given more attention to construction of the controversial steel flyover in Bengaluru and paid only a lip service to drought in villages, the Congress members raised the issue of demonetisation. Participating in the discussion on drought and drinking water problem, Mr. Ravi remarked: “Let the government build a steel or silver flyover when there is abundance wealth. But now, more than three-fourths of the taluks in the State have been declared drought-hit and there is no need to spend on construction of the flyover.” Congress members countered by saying that farmers have not been able to withdraw money from their accounts and purchase seeds and other inputs owing to demonetisation. The Centre was more responsible for sufferings of rural people, said Bengaluru Development Minister K.J. George and Transport Minister Ramalinga Reddy. This resulted in a heated exchange of words between the Congress and the BJP members. Earlier, Opposition JD (S) members sought permission to discuss the impact of demonetisation on District Credit Co-operative Banks through an adjournment motion. When the Speaker asked them to wait till the completion of discussion on drought, JD(S) members trooped into the well of the House and commenced a dharna leading to adjournment of the House for some time.

This exemption should apply equally for payments at private hospitals too. We hope the government will step in quickly to resolve this anomaly,” said Manish Mattoo, Zonal Director of Fortis Hospitals, who recently wrote to the Centre in this regard. New modes of payment Meanwhile, all private hospitals have relented on accepting payments from patients through cheque, online transfers or net banking. Sudarshan Ballal, Chairman of Manipal Hospitals, said following the new rule, the hospital has seen a 20 per cent dip in patient flow. “Apart from accepting cheques, which we normally don’t, and allowing online and debit/credit payments, we are also facilitating opening of bank accounts for patients in our hospital’s bank so that they can deposit payments easily,” he said. Some hospitals are also offering discretionary credit to patients. Sudhir Pai, Executive Director and Chief Executive Officer of Vikram Hospital, said the hospital is accepting cheques (including post-dated), online transfers, RTGS and card payment. Columbia Asia Hospitals is offering an EMI option for in-patient procedures. The hospital’s Chief Finance Officer Jagannath M.S. said, “We are also working on integrating mobile wallets and providing a payment gateway on our website.” Printable version | Jan 7, 2017 1:28:51 AM | http://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/Private-hospitals-seek-permission-to-accept-old-currency/article16679667.ece © The Hindu The lack of biodiversity has proved detrimental to native species, flora and fauna"

Official sources told The Hindu that the team members would hold discussion with bank officials, District Collector, officials of various departments and people from various walks of life to get a feedback on the situation from five different angles. The special team officials would initially check the currency availability in bank branches and ATMs across the district and the facilities set up at banks for withdrawal, deposit and exchange of currency notes. Already, widespread complaints were there from the industrial clusters across the district about the lack of adequate currencies in the ATMs with many of the machines remaining non-operational for long time. Even the ATM situated next door to the Lead Bank office in Tirupur Collectorate has not been opened for the past few days due to the non-availability of currencies especially in the denomination of Rs 100. The team members would then examine whether the calibration of the ATMs to dispense Rs. 2,000 and the new Rs. 500 currency notes was going at the desired pace. The impact of demonetisation on households, industrial and informal sectors, transportation, farmers and daily wage earners would be studied separately. A report will be submitted to the government on the situation, sources said.

But it turned out to be the other way round. “There is sudden drop in the cyber crime rate and in the last 10 days no fresh case has been reported. In normal times, we would record at least two cases per day”, Inspector of Cyber Crime Police Station K. Satyanarayana Rao said. After notifying that the Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,000 notes would no longer be legal tender there has been a huge rush at the banks to exchange the old notes and withdraw small change. “Many have switched to online banking to save time and avoid the rush, and this prompted us to be cautious, as there were many first time online bankers, who included senior citizens and from rural areas. Keeping this in mind we expected a spurt in the crime rate,” he added. DCP (Crime) T. Ravi Kumar Murthy attributes the drop in crime rate to the cautious approach by people or it may be just a lull before the criminals strike it rich. “And what is needed at this moment is educating the people on the online usage,” said the DCP. This year, the Cyber Crime Police Station recorded about 250 cases till October 30 and of them 190 pertain to cases where criminals could persuade the victims to divulge their OTP (One Time Password). According to Head of the Department of Computer Science of Andhra University College of Engineering P.V.G.D. Prasada Reddy, online transactions would increase from now and cyber criminals will be on the prowl. Apart from securing the systems, the process must be more user-friendly. The authorities concerned should think of incorporating regional language in the user interface. Rural people will benefit from this move, he said. Moreover, to make the system more simpler and security-proof, the interface should also be made voice enabled. This apart, the government should now also think of organising mass training camps to educate the people, especially the rural people, to enable them to use the online system more securely, said Prof. Prasada Reddy. As per the National Crime Record Bureau Visakhapatnam city, has been ranked second after Bangalore in the country to record maximum number of cyber crimes since 2011.

Retail sale of its products, including highly popular Girijan honey, flower tamarind, red rajma, turmeric powder, shikakai, soapnut and ‘Triphala churnam’ have come down by 50 per cent since the announcement of demonetisation of high-value notes from the midnight of November 8. GCC was formed to rescue tribal forest-dwellers from the clutches of middlemen who used to exploit them taking advantage of their innocence. It procures non-timber forest produce from them by offering remunerative price. The retail sale has come down by 50 per cent. GCC has set a target of Rs.367 crore for 2016-17 of which the retail sale is estimated at Rs.35 crore. It also sells essential commodities like kerosene, rice, oil and pulses through depots run by it in all tribal villages. The turnover from the depots is originally expected to cross Rs.150 crore in addition to Rs.100 crore from fuel stations. Sale at fuel stations, managed by GCC, has not been hit as they are accepting old notes as per the government directive. GCC Vice-Chairman-cum-Managing Director A.S.P.S. Ravi Prakash has told The Hindu on Tuesday that they had taken the demonetisation move and the subsequent currency crisis as a challenge and are taking steps on a war-footing for popularising digital transactions. “We are in talks with banks and initiating measures to install swiping machines at retail outlets including our shops run at Millennium Bunk, Ushodaya junction and Gajuwaka in the city. At the franchisee outlets across Andhra Pradesh, we want to install swiping machines.” Mr. Ravi Prakash has said they are also keen on accepting digital wallets so as to popularise e-payments at all the outlets in the cities and towns.

They are also facing trouble in depositing and exchanging their money in banks. Around 3,000 families out of 12,500 in the tribal mandals under ITDA-Sithampet region could get Jan-Dhan bank accounts under financial inclusion programme. NABARD and local NGOs had explained them about the benefits of the banking system and made them to open accounts in nearby mandal headquarters such as Sithampet, Palakonda, Kotturu, Bhamini, and Veeraghattam. However, they have to travel at least 30 km to reach the bank from hilly areas. Many villages do not have road network and transport facility. In fact, many farmers are having regular income with the sale of their produces in shandies in places like Sithampet, Kusumi, Polla, and Dhonubhai. “We used to get around Rs.8 per piece of cauliflower. Its price has gone down to Rs.5 with the traders reluctant to buy them due to non-availability of Rs.100 notes. Many of them are not taking even on credit basis as they are also facing troubles to transport them to cities like Srikakulam and Visakhapatnam,” says Arika Durgarao, a tribal farmer in Kotturu. “With great difficulty, we could arrange Rs.800, all Rs.100 notes, to families in places like Dhonubhai and Kusumi. The local trader agreed to take old currency notes and give Rs.100 notes to the needy families,” says Nuka Sanyasi Rao, director of ARTS, a non-governmental organisation. People representatives of all parties urged the ITDA to provide exchange of notes for the tribal families since a majority of them don’t have banking facility. Srikakulam Collector P. Lakshmi Narasimham has suggested the ITDA officials to reach out to the tribal people with the support of designated business correspondents of the banks concerned.

591,2016-11-22,15.0,Demonetisation impacts aquabusiness in Krishna district,"MACHILIPATNAM: Demonetisation has paralysed the flourishing aqua business in Krishna district where export of the freshwater fish production has come to a halt. Harvesting of two freshwater fish species – rohu and catla – had to be postponed in over one lakh hectares of aqua ponds in Krishna district and in the areas of its neighbouring West Godavari district. Rohu and catla are the most economically important fish species which are cultivated in Krishna district. Above 80 per cent of the production of freshwater fish species is being exported to Kolkata and Odisha states. “Price of rohu and catla at the domestic market has fallen drastically owning to the impact of demonetisation. The price fall of the two species this year is 20 per cent when compared to the last season,” Central Institute of Freshwater Aquaculture senior scientist B. Seshagiri has told The Hindu. However, Mr. Seshagiri has opined that the impact of the demonetisation will be less on those who could manage the expenditure to postpone the harvesting of the fish. Ironically, farmers of Kaikaluru, Mandavalli and other areas surrounding the Kolleru lake are the worst affected as freshwater aquaculture has been thriving in this region over the years. Aquaculture farmers have observed that they are unable to provide the work for those who depend on aquaculture due to lack of work in the wake of postponement of fish harvesting. Several thousands of workers directly depend on aquaculture ponds for daily work including collection and loading of the fish.

594,2016-11-22,15.0,Demonetisation may cost them dear,"There are 226 spotted deer and 27 sambar deer at the one-and-a-half-acre enclosure on the Hill Palace campus at Thripunithura.
  Demonetisation is likely to hit captive animals very dearly. Hundreds of spotted deer and sambar deer of the deer park on Hill Palace campus, Thripunithura, may go hungry if the restriction on cash withdrawal from banks continues beyond the month end. There are 226 spotted deer and 27 sambar deer at the one-and-a-half-acre enclosure on the campus. The weekly ceiling of Rs.24,000 on withdrawal of cash from banks is threatening to deny feed to the caged animals. Each month, the Centre for Heritage Studies (CHS), which is managing the deer park, pays a significant amount for the purchase of fodder and cattle feed. If the restrictions are not eased, it could lead to a possible stoppage of the purchase of feed. The monthly payment for fodder and feed, which would come to around Rs.1.25 lakh, is advanced to the agencies concerned on the first day of every month. Since the payment for the current month was paid earlier, feed and fodder would be available till this month end. “If the contractor who supplies the fodder and the agency from where the feed is purchased refuse to accept the cheques, as there is a ceiling on withdrawal, the animals may go hungry,” said an official of the CHS. Salary not paid The CHS functioning from the Hill Palace Campus is already reeling under severe financial crisis and the salary of the 39 casual labourers could not be disbursed last week. A cheque issued to a worker for clearing some dangerously hanging branches of trees had to be presented twice. When the Centre imposed the restriction, the labourers who sweated it out under the sun to keep the campus and museum clean and presentable for the visitors had to go without the wages last week. Uncertainty looms large over the payment of salary for the coming weeks too. The workers are paid Rs.350 a day and by weekend, the CHS needs around Rs.75,000 for their wages. It has become impossible to meet the other expenses too with the curb on cash withdrawal, said the Registrar of CHS. Besides the casual workers, the salary of the Director General, guest faculty, teachers and regular employees of the CHS are paid in cash, which is monthly withdrawn from the bank. The ceiling may affect the salary disbursement too. “If the salaries have to be credited to their personal bank accounts, the Board of Management of the CHS will have to take a decision on it ,” he said.

  : The Tamil Nadu Congress Committee on Monday protested against the Central government’s “lack of preparedness” after calling for the withdrawal of Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,000 notes. TNCC president Su. Thirunavukkarasar said that meetings were held outside various central government offices in all districts. The protest in Chennai was organised adjacent to the district collector’s office. The TNCC president said that the protest would not be a one-day affair, as, “Modi will give us more chances.” He blamed both the Central and State governments for the plight of those who have been affected by demonetisation. “We do not know if the Tamil Nadu government is walking, sitting or sleeping at this moment. It is a bad government,” he said. He reminded his audience that it was Rahul Gandhi who had raised the issue of demonetisation as a people’s problem. “The PM will have to be a family man to know how this move affects families,” he said.

DINUKA LIYANAWATTE As India grapples with the implications of demonetisation, many Sri Lankans are watching it keenly. Not just those planning a trip across the Palk Bay but also others who remember a similar exercise undertaken by the Sri Lankan government in the early 1970s to declare 50 and 100 rupee notes illegal tender. It was the initiative of N.M. Perera, a renowned Left politician who was then Finance Minister. The Trotskyist Lanka Sama Samaja Party (LSSP) he led was in the coalition government, led by Sirimavo Bandaranaike of the Sri Lanka Freedom Party. The LSSP’s current leader, Tissa Vitharana, said the initiative came when there was evidence that large amounts of money had been out of the banking system. “There was a feeling that people had not declared their wealth for taxation,” said Mr. Vitharana, who served as a Cabinet Minister in the government of Mahinda Rajapaksa. Unique exercise Many economists have deemed the exercise unique in Sri Lanka’s monetary history. “In the process, the details of the owner were passed on to the Department of Inland Revenue. With this information, it was possible to rope in additional sums of tax,” wrote economist Saman Kelegama, in his commentary on N.M. Perera’s Policies and Achievements as Finance Minister, a book authored by senior academic Buddhadasa Hewavitharana. “There was not as much chaos as there seems to be in India now,” said former cricket administrator and businessman Chandra Shaffter, who was on a visit to India, when The Hindu contacted him. “At that time in Sri Lanka, ordinary citizens were not inconvenienced, only the rich who had hoarded money complained,” he recalled. According to W.D. Lakshman, economist and former Vice-Chancellor of the University of Colombo, the exercise brought a substantial amount back into the banking sector and helped maintain a healthy tax-to-GDP ratio. “It was a very innovative attempt. N.M. Perera had a long history of activism,” he said. “Ordinary people responded positively, while the upper middle class, particularly those who had kept money hoarded, had an issue,” Prof. Lakshman said. It was, some observed, part of a general resentment at the Leftist leader whom the wealthier classes saw as bad for business. Not very long after, Prime Minister J.R. Jayawardene, who won a massive mandate in the next general election, liberalised the economy in 1977. The positive response of the ordinary citizens was also to do with the strong banking sector in the early 1970s, Prof. Lakshman said The move hurt only those who had a lot of cash on hand, not others, said Devanesan Nesiah, a civil servant at that time. .

597,2016-11-22,15.0,Mamata to take protest to States against demonetisation,"Extending an invite to Opposition parties to join her protest against demonetisation, West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee on Monday announced plans of rallies in Delhi, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar and Punjab on the issue in next few weeks. Ms. Banerjee would be in Delhi on November 23 and 24 and hold a rally at Lucknow on November 29 followed by events in Bihar on December 1 and 2 and also visit Punjab. “We are ready to join any political programme and anyone can join our programme. This is a movement of people. I have no personal interest in this,” she said. Her announcement came 72 hours after her deadline in Delhi that she would go for nationwide protests if the government did not withdraw demonetisation. In West Bengal, her party Trinamool Congress (TMC) had already announced plans of a State-wide protest on Wednesday. While she raised questions on the “hidden agenda” for demonetisation, she accused Prime Minister Narendra Modi of threatening the opposition. “The Prime Minister is threatening other parties who are raising their voices against demonetisation. PM should be sober. PM should behave like a PM. If necessary, he should convene an all-party meeting on the issue,” she said, adding that she would not be “cowed down by such threats.” “Don’t take it like an ego fight. Did we not support GST [Goods and Services Tax] for the interest of the country knowing that State earnings will drop,” Ms Banerjee said. Meanwhile, the Communist Party of India (Marxist) marched with the Chit Fund Sufferers Forum during the day and gave a deputation to Governor Keshari Nath Tripathi. “There is an understanding between the BJP and her [Ms. Banerjee] and she is there to destroy the rest of the Opposition. This is true for Bengal and now rest of the country is also understanding this,” CPI(M) State Secretary Surjya Kanta Mishra said. Dr. Mishra said the Prime Minister had raised the chit fund issue in the past but nothing had been done in this regard.

  “On this 9/11 (Indian style)”, somebody tweeted, “the USA (oldest democracy in the world, according to some experts) and India (by far the largest democracy in the world) moved from black to white, overnight.” In both cases the public came out on the streets. But of course for different reasons. In the U.S. there was ‘anger on the streets’, with protestors displaying placards with the message ‘Not My President’. More than a thousand CEOs urged Donald Trump to ‘stop divisive politics’. It was really ‘shock and awe’, and a news magazine had reportedly prepared its issue in anticipation of a Hillary victory. In India, people were on the street, fretting and fuming about the delay in exchanging their old notes with new ones and over malfunctioning of or non-availability of cash in ATMs. Even after three days I found several ATMs closed or non-functional, while others had not seen the cash delivery van since the demonetisation demon was unleashed. The cash crunch led to sporadic violence, and ration shops in some places were looted. While there were some cases of dire distress, there were others of philanthropic humanitarianism, where shopkeepers extended credit facility to their customers. Nevertheless, there was a general public perception that the initiative, though welcome since it could have a positive domino effect on the economy over the long term, had been launched without adequate preparation and hence the arrangements for implementation left much to be desired. Some remedial measures were, of course, introduced subsequently; but given the small size of the premises of most of the bank branches and the logistics of queue management, I wonder how many of them could actually be implemented. One thing is, however, certain; everyone was made to fall in line. It also reinforced the virtue of frugality and established the supremacy of small currency. People were found ‘flaunting’ hundred rupee notes. Politicians had their own take on the event. The decision was variously described as ‘Tuglaqi farman’, an anti-poor measure and an undeclared financial emergency. It was alleged that having made arrangement for itself, the ruling party had attempted to stymie the Opposition in the coming elections. On a more sober note, it was also suggested that the withdrawal of the currency should have been preceded by an announcement a few days earlier. Three of them  At a personal level, I belong to that generation that has been witness to three demonetisations so far. I actually felt nostalgic, since the realigned composition of my wallet reminded me of an era gone by, when it used to consist of mostly ten rupee notes and coins, and an occasional hundred rupee note. But I did not have to rush to banks or ATMs. As a pensioner, my monthly pension gets credited into my bank account a few days before the end of the month. I therefore make it a point to withdraw the money required for the next month, during the last couple of days of the previous month. I also ask my bank to give me the money in notes of different denominations, including at least one bundle of 100 rupee notes. When the bolt from the blue came, I had a considerable stock of 100 rupee notes to defray the daily milk and vegetable charges for a few months. But my plan was found wanting on one count. Since I had withdrawn currency notes of higher denominations too just a few days ago, I had to put them back in the bank. For a variety of reasons, including demonetisation of currency in India and the unexpected result of the elections in the U.S., some individuals wanted to drown their sorrows (also known as gam galat karana in Hindi, popularised by such icons as Devdas) in their favourite brand of the bubbly. But they were in for a shock on two counts. First, since the shops would not entertain high denomination notes; and, second, if someone bought a small measure with lower currency and tried to down it in public in Delhi, he would have been fined Rs. 5,000 for the offence in the first instance. The collectors of old coins and currency notes too were licking their lips in anticipation of a windfall in future. Cases of small thefts perceptibly declined; in one case the snatched purse was returned with a slap. In case of temples, the old notes are still current and the government is unlikely to ask any questions because, in a sense, it amounts to payment of tax directly to God, the original source of the coffers of the Reserve Bank of India.

599,2016-11-22,15.0,Campaign for circulating small currency catches up,"Campaign by many educated persons on social media for circulating small currency to help street vendors and petty businessmen not to suffer post-demonetisation is catching up. Micro-blogging sites like Whatsapp, Facebook and Twitter are being used to spread the word after noticing that some consumers are trying to make small purchases by insisting on change by producing newly launched Rs.2,000 notes. Secretary of Steel Executives’ Association Anil Kumar said in a Whatsapp post: “Please buy items you need like fruits and vegetables from small vendors and not from malls or super markets. We can easily use cards, but for them, getting 100 rupees for a few days is tough and will help them reinvest again in their business. Buy some from them, may be for just 100 rupees per day or on alternate days and it will help them in a big way. Thank you and please forward to others as well.” For want of change, many in Rythu Bazaars, fish markets at Fishing Harbour, MVP Colony, Railway New Colony, Gajuwaka and Ukkunagaram are facing untold hardship. As realty sector has been hit hard, daily wage workers are not able to earn anything. Faced with dull sales during Karthika Masam, fish vendors are finding it difficult to meet their both ends met. “Many come to us and offer Rs.2,000 notes for a purchase of Rs.200. There are some who insist that we should accept old Rs.500 notes,” remarked Pydamma, who sells fish at Nehru Bazaar for past 30 years. “The need is not to hide small currency notes and coins at home. We should circulate them into the market so as to help street vendors and small-time businessmen,” said AP Chambers of Commerce and Industry State president-elect G. Sambasiva Rao. Mr. Rao said high value notes should be used only during transactions made at malls and big shops. As it is, he said one should prefer to shift to digital mode by making payment from digital wallets or credit/debit cards. Fishermen activist and advocate Ganta Papa Rao said it was responsibility of every citizen not to trouble roadside vendors and before making any purchase, it was better to come prepared with Rs.50 and Rs.100 notes to offer them.

601,2016-11-22,15.0,Behind demonetisation,"Demonetisation was to strike at the roots of black money, counterfeit notes and terror funding. But the fact is that an all-cash currency economy is not evil or bad but essential for our type of economy. Demonetisation must strike at the roots of those who have accumulated wealth through corrupt practices. It will be a success when the common man gains, the middle class is confident, the corrupt are struck by fear and the wealthy know they have to abide by the laws of the land. Mathew George, Thiruvananthapuram The popular explanation is that demonetisation is a surgical strike to remove black money, to paralyse the terrorist and to weed out fake currency. This argument is very convincing but the purpose appears to be multifold. The main benefit is to increase the value of rupee relative to other international currencies such as the dollar, the euro and the yen. In a cash economy, currency is parked and the Reserve Bank has to keep printing more money to keep the economy going. The total value of national wealth must be declared regularly and accounted. One waits for the day when the Indian rupee can be floated as an international currency. But for this, there has to be an attempt to raise productivity. Mohammed Yousuff, Glen Waverley, Victoria, Australia “Politicians behind chit fund scams are now attacking me, says Modi” (Nov.21) may be a catchy heading but the Prime Minister cannot forget that in a democratic set-up, the Opposition plays an important role in raising genuine issues/concerns regarding ongoing policies. Specific answers should be given to the Opposition. The Opposition has collectively raised a genuine concern and citizens expect a specific and relevant answer to the point raised. Lalita Ramakrishnan, Gurugram It is shocking that black money hoarders are now heading to temples to make those they worship partners in crime (“Demonetised notes pour into TTD temple hundis”, Nov.21). The TTD administration should send all such notes to the Enforcement Directorate where they should be destroyed. It should also make an announcement that demonetised notes will not be accepted. V.

602,2016-11-22,15.0,High Court to hear plea against demonetisation,"The Delhi High Court on Monday admitted a plea against demonetisation of Rs.500 and Rs.1,000 notes and will hear the petition on Tuesday. The petition has been moved by Pooja Mahajan, who runs a showroom here. Ms. Mahajan has said that since the two notes have been declared as illegal tender, the government cannot direct hospitals and petrol pumps to accept the old notes. The petitioner has also urged that the new Rs.2,000 note be discontinued. The petitioner’s counsel pleaded that the matter needed urgent hearing as Ms. Mahajan was facing a problem earning her livelihood and it was an infringement of her fundamental rights. ‘Against the Constitution’ The petitioner urged the court to quash various notifications regarding demonetisation, saying they are in contravention of the Constitution and the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) Act. Section 24 of the RBI Act deals with denomination of notes, which empowers the RBI and the Centre to issue bank notes of various denominations as mentioned in Section 24 (1) and (2) of the Act, the plea said. “Till date, the government has not issued any notification under Section 24 (2) of the RBI Act for discontinuing currency notes of Rs.500 and Rs.1,000,” the plea said, adding that the Rs.2,000 notes were being circulated by the government against the mandate of Section 24(1). The petitioner also alleged that “on the pretext of exchange of notes, the government cannot prosecute and misuse the provisions of the Income Tax Act by treating the cash deposit for exchange as unaccounted money”. A Bench headed by Justice B. D. Ahmed will hear the matter on Tuesday.

604,2016-11-22,15.0,Denizens find it tough to beat demonetisation blues,"Endless wait: Large crowds continue to throng ATMs even as banks report shortage of cash.
  Ever since the night of November 8, Kalyan J. tried a few times to draw some money from the ATMs and another time through the cheque across the counter. He failed both times, once baulking at the huge queues. But, he could not keep out the demonetisation blues from hitting him. After his SUV got serviced, the automotive centre wanted to know the mode of payment. “No cash...err...what about a cheque?,” he asked. “No cheques sir.” So, it can be moved online to your office account? “We have opened another account for servicing, please send to it.” But, then its already past online banking hours and next transaction is next day. “There is no money in the banks and I have accounts in a top private and a nationalised bank. They are refusing to accept cheques to give cash across the counter. I am unable to pay my staff and even they are not able to do any transactions,” he bemoans. “I am a regular tax payer and I am not getting access to my money,” he sniggers. More than dozen days after the ‘D’ bomb dropped by Prime Minister Modi, rarely does one come across anyone not suffering any collateral damage even as the banking system struggles to get going due to the heavy demand on their services. “There is no money irrespective of whether I try from my savings account or my current account. A token is being issued when cheques are presented and not the amount sought,” sighs Mr. Kalyan, running an ad agency. And, he found it was not that easy to open accounts for his staff to credit salaries as cheque from an existing bank account was sought as “introduction amount”! As is clear, those not in a hurry to queue up for exchanging old notes or draw money too are feeling the pinch. “People are used to cash and payment through cheques mean a waiting period of three to four working days. Digital payments has its own limitations in the sense of timings and amount while banks are unable to cope up with the sudden surge,” says M. Raj Kumar, a director of a BPO/retailer firm. Not just in the city, at Mall, 60 km away, banks are not aware of allowing farmers to withdraw Rs.24,000 too. “They are giving Rs.4,000 to Rs.6,000 only,” claims Narasimha, a tenant farmer. Adds Srinivas, a farm house manager: Half the workers are standing outside banks for cash on any given day to draw money.

Terming India’s demonetisation move as one of the “most sweeping change in currency policy that has occurred anywhere in the world in decades”, Mr. Summers said, “…For the government to expropriate from even a few innocent victims who, for one reason or another, do not manage to convert their money is highly problematic.”  “We strongly suspect that those with the largest amount of ill-gotten gain do not hold their wealth in cash but instead have long since converted it into foreign exchange, gold, bitcoin or some other store of value. So it is petty fortunes, not the hugest and most problematic ones, that are being targeted,” Mr. Summers, currently Charles W. Eliot Professor and President Emeritus at Harvard, said.

608,2016-11-22,15.0,Flower business takes a hit post-demonetisation,"The usually bustling flower market in the century-old Devaraja Market has seen a drop in its business since over a week after the Union government demonetised Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,000 notes. This is the time when florists and flower designers usually work overtime to meet the orders for weddings, village festivals and so on. Even retail business has registered dull business. Flower business has recorded a 50-60 per cent drop owing to the currency crisis in the aftermath of the demonetisation of Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,000 notes, claim flower vendors who are into the business since many years. Mujahid Pasha, a flower designer at the market, said, “Those engaged in flower decorations and garland-making used to get a lot of orders, especially in November, from Mysuru and other places in view of weddings. I heard people are putting off weddings owing to cash crunch and this has impacted our business too.” Jasmine price falls With the fall in demand for flowers, jasmine growers are not getting suitable price for their produce. Despite the fall in production, jasmine is being sold at Rs. 350-400 a kg whose price should have been in such a situation between Rs. 1,000 and Rs. 1,200 a kg, flower vendors said. Moreover, supply of jasmine variety from Tamil Nadu, which is among the popular variety and an integral part of flower business here, has been affected post-demonetisation. “The daily supply from cities and towns bordering the State has been cut owing to currency shortage. The vendors don’t give credit and this is one issue which needs to be addressed soon,” said Noor Pasha, a flower vendor. Noor Pasha said both wholesale and retail business has been dull. “Owing to the issue of change, retail business has seen a fall since we don’t have sufficient change for transactions for a higher denomination note,” Noor Pasha added. Khalid, a flower decorator, who along with Mujahid Pasha designs decorative garlands, said a bunch of ornamental roses, which used to cost Rs. 150 (for 20 pieces), is now available for Rs. 40 a bunch. “You can just imagine how the scenario is. Remember, this is the marriage season and the demand should have been more,” he added. For Swamy Gowda and Raje Gowda and Kumara hailing from Bookanakere hobli and Hoskote respectively, who have grown chrysanthemum, their daily earnings from flowers have fallen by 50 per cent. The market has been flooded with chrysanthemum, but there is no demand and not many takers. “After paying to labourers for plucking flowers in the fields, we end up earning a meagre Rs. 100 a day growing flowers. Glut and currency crisis has eaten into our revenue,” claim the growers, while searching for flower buyers opposite the Dufferin Clock here.

  : The Delhi Congress on Sunday held protests across the Capital against the Centre’s demonetisation exercise. The demonstrations, termed ‘Jan Aakrosh March’, were held in all the 70 Assembly constituencies. Speaking at one such rally near the Jahangirpuri metro station, Delhi Congress president Ajay Maken said there was a scam behind the decision to withdraw Rs.500 and Rs.1,000 notes as “poor people’s money is being given to the rich through this exercise”. ‘Fall in productivity’ He further said the country had been brought to a standstill with people queuing up at banks to withdraw or exchange money. He claimed that had led to a fall in productivity across sectors. The protesters also demanded the setting up of a Joint Parliamentary Committee to look into the alleged scam. Party to approach PM Mr. Maken added that Congress workers would march to the Prime Minister’s residence on Wednesday to “explain to him the problems being faced by people”.

610,2016-11-22,15.0,Demonetisation may cost them dear,"Demonetisation is likely to hit captive animals very dearly. Hundreds of spotted deer and sambar deer of the deer park on Hill Palace campus, Thripunithura, may go hungry if the restriction on cash withdrawal from banks continues beyond the month end. There are 226 spotted deer and 27 sambar deer at the one-and-a-half-acre enclosure on the campus. The weekly ceiling of Rs.24,000 on withdrawal of cash from banks is threatening to deny feed to the caged animals. Each month, the Centre for Heritage Studies (CHS), which is managing the deer park, pays a significant amount for the purchase of fodder and cattle feed. If the restrictions are not eased, it could lead to a possible stoppage of the purchase of feed. The monthly payment for fodder and feed, which would come to around Rs.1.25 lakh, is advanced to the agencies concerned on the first day of every month. Since the payment for the current month was paid earlier, feed and fodder would be available till this month end. “If the contractor who supplies the fodder and the agency from where the feed is purchased refuse to accept the cheques, as there is a ceiling on withdrawal, the animals may go hungry,” said an official of the CHS. Salary not paid The CHS functioning from the Hill Palace Campus is already reeling under severe financial crisis and the salary of the 39 casual labourers could not be disbursed last week. A cheque issued to a worker for clearing some dangerously hanging branches of trees had to be presented twice. When the Centre imposed the restriction, the labourers who sweated it out under the sun to keep the campus and museum clean and presentable for the visitors had to go without the wages last week. Uncertainty looms large over the payment of salary for the coming weeks too. The workers are paid Rs.350 a day and by weekend, the CHS needs around Rs.75,000 for their wages. It has become impossible to meet the other expenses too with the curb on cash withdrawal, said the Registrar of CHS. Besides the casual workers, the salary of the Director General, guest faculty, teachers and regular employees of the CHS are paid in cash, which is monthly withdrawn from the bank. The ceiling may affect the salary disbursement too. “If the salaries have to be credited to their personal bank accounts, the Board of Management of the CHS will have to take a decision on it ,” he said.

Svoboda’s ‘Aghora: At the Left Hand of God’ to Ruskin Bond’s The Laughing Skull, Kavita Kane’s Sita’s Sister to Devdutt Pattanaik’s Mahabharata, Turner’s Choultry appears to be an apt place for book lovers to browse an array of popular titles. The on-going annual book exhibition, presented by Visalandhra Book House, primarily aims at rekindling the joy of reading. A major part of the fair includes Telugu titles stocked in different sections. However, a good number of English titles have also been on display at the venue. Of all, ‘Sagaragosha’ written by Garikipati Narasimha Rao, ‘Ardhanareeswarudu’ written by Perumal Murugan and translated by L.R. Swamy, ‘Vibhajana Katha’ by Vundavalli Arunkumar and ‘Runam’ by Gollapudi Maruthi Rao are flying off the shelves like hot cakes. Though the organisers of the book fair are accepting old currency notes, they mentioned that the sales dropped by 40 per cent when compared to previous exhibitions. “Customers can pay Rs.1,000 or Rs.500 for the purchase provided they buy books worth Rs.900 or Rs.400 in exchange of demonetised notes,” P.A. Raju, manager of the book house, said and added that a portion of the stock could not reach the city in time after the Centre’s demonetisation move. Bookworms, who came to stuff the bags with their favourite titles, said the government’s demonetisation decision did not impact their purchase power. “Ardent readers will always find a way out. I prefer spending my pocket money for books. With the acceptance of demonetised notes, shopping turns out to be a hassle-free experience,” shares T. Madhu, M.Sc student of Andhra University.

612,2016-11-22,15.0,Demonetisation hits farm sector,"Demonetisation has come at an inopportune time for the farming community as November is the month when khariff crop harvest picks up pace, coinciding with the sowing of rabi crop in Prakasam district. Farm sector is among the worst-affected with farmers badly in need of cash to complete the harvest of khariff crops saved against odds in view of drought and start sowing of the winter crops like Bengal gram and tobacco. Thanks to tight liquidity position, the price of vegetables and other crops are falling. Cotton growers are in an unenvious position with the price of white gold crashing to about Rs. 4,100 per quintal in the market from about Rs. 5,600 per quintal in the pre-demonetisation period. “Adding to our woes, the traders are asking us to accept payments in scrapped notes of Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,000,” says a group of cotton growers from Inkollur who have deferred plucking hoping that the cash crunch will ease in the next one week to 10 days. They welcomed the Centre’s decision to allow scrapped notes for purchase of seed and fertilisers during the rabi season. The monetary crisis has brought to the fore the resilience of the farming community in the post-demonetisation phase. Farmers, who have been hitherto used to cash transactions mostly, are exploring all ways to stay afloat and undergo pain in the fond hope that better days will come. Note shortage “No doubt, we are facing severe cash crunch. We will bear it as the nation will be benefited in the long run as a result of weeding out of black money and counterfeit notes,” says a farmer leader, Jagarlamudi Anil Babu, from the rice-rich Karamchedu village. With only Rs. 2,000 notes made available in banks, there is a huge shortage of notes in Rs. 100 and Rs. 50 denomination needed to make payments to farm workers and purchase of farm inputs. “We have found a solution to the persistent problem by deferring payments to farm workers and paying partly in the form of rice,” he says. “We have started paying the workers partly in the form of rice and stand guarantee to small loans extended to them by the local grocery shops to buy other essential commodities,” says Palaparthi Srinivasa Rao, a farmer from Nagulapupadu. The trust they enjoy with suppliers of farm inputs have ensured uninterrupted supply of pesticides to their farms on credit. “The fertiliser dealers also oblige us by accepting scrapped Rs. 500 and Rs.1,000 notes,” says another farmer, G.Veeraragavalu from Chadalavada. “With no access to institutional credit, tenant farmers, who are mainly depend upon private money lenders, faced difficulty in raising capital for the rabi crop,” says Kuvulu Rythu Sangam State secretary N. Ranga Rao. The farmers needed about Rs. 3,200 crore in cash, particularly lower denomination of Rs. 50 and Rs. 100 notes to pay farm workers and complete the harvest of khariff crop in about 40 lakh hectares in the State without any hassles, according to YSRC farmers’ wing State president N.V.S. Nagi Reddy.

613,2016-11-22,15.0,Over Rs 1 crore in old currency notes looted from bank in Odisha,"Currency notes of Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,000 may have ceased to be legal tender, but are still in demand when it comes to bank robbers. Miscreants decamped with cash worth Rs. 1.10 crore, which were in old Rs. 500 and R. 1000 denominations, from the Dhenkanal Gramya Bank. The incident came to light when the bank reopened on Monday. Following announcement of demonetisation, people had deposited about Rs. 12 crore in Rs. 500 and Rs. 1000 notes in the bank. Of this, around Rs. 3 crore cash had already been transferred to Reserve Bank of India. Miscreants committed the theft by breaking 13 locks including lock of main door and five strong room locks. “When we came to bank on Monday, everything was found open. We immediately informed police who found old currency notes worth Rs. 1.10 crore missing,” said Naba Krishore Sahoo, branch manager of Dhenkanal Gramya Bank, on Monday. “All preparation had been completed for transferring the money to RBI on Saturday. But due to some technical problem, the cash could not be despatched,” said Mr. Sahoo. “We are checking CCTV footage. We are wondering what would have been the intention of robbers. The miscreants cannot immediately encash this high volume of old notes. In this light, we are deciding our line of investigation,” said Basant Panigrahi, Dhenkanal Superintendent of Police. “The incident has come to our notice. We have sought details of the incident. In wake of the incident, banks have been requested to send cash deposits to RBI immediately. They should not invite unnecessary risk by keeping cash with them,” said Sarada Prasanna Mohanty, General Manager at RBI’s regional centre here.

614,2016-11-22,15.0,Demonetisation: Congress stages protests,"Congress workers staged a protest near the Coimbatore Railway Junction on Monday against the Central Government’s move to demonetise high value currency notes. The party’s Coimbatore Urban District president V.M.C. Manoharan, who along with his rural counterpart K. Mahesh Kumar led the protest, said that after announcing demonetisation, the Government did not take enough steps to mitigate the plight of the common man. People continued to queue up outside banks and ATMs. But it was of no use as both banks and ATMs ran out of cash by noon. Adding to the worry was the Government giving new instruction every day. It first fixed the exchange limit at Rs. 4,000, then increased it to Rs. 4,500 and now reduced it to Rs. 2,000. Mr. Manoharan said that what the Government was doing was taxing common man in the name of fighting black money. The Congress, therefore, wanted to protest to highlight the common man’s suffering, he added. The police removed around 100 protesters from the venue. They also removed another 110 protesters, who staged a similar protest in Singanallur under the State General Secretary Mayura Jayakumar’s leadership.

He failed both times, once baulking at the huge queues. But, he could not keep out the demonetisation blues from hitting him. After his SUV got serviced, the automotive centre wanted to know the mode of payment. “No cash...err...what about a cheque?,” he asked. “No cheques sir.” So, it can be moved online to your office account? “We have opened another account for servicing, please send to it.” But, then its already past online banking hours and next transaction is next day. “There is no money in the banks and I have accounts in a top private and a nationalised bank. They are refusing to accept cheques to give cash across the counter. I am unable to pay my staff and even they are not able to do any transactions,” he bemoans. “I am a regular tax payer and I am not getting access to my money,” he sniggers. More than dozen days after the ‘D’ bomb dropped by Prime Minister Modi, rarely does one come across anyone not suffering any collateral damage even as the banking system struggles to get going due to the heavy demand on their services. “There is no money irrespective of whether I try from my savings account or my current account. A token is being issued when cheques are presented and not the amount sought,” sighs Mr. Kalyan, running an ad agency. And, he found it was not that easy to open accounts for his staff to credit salaries as cheque from an existing bank account was sought as “introduction amount”! As is clear, those not in a hurry to queue up for exchanging old notes or draw money too are feeling the pinch. “People are used to cash and payment through cheques mean a waiting period of three to four working days. Digital payments has its own limitations in the sense of timings and amount while banks are unable to cope up with the sudden surge,” says M. Raj Kumar, a director of a BPO/retailer firm. Not just in the city, at Mall, 60 km away, banks are not aware of allowing farmers to withdraw Rs.24,000 too. “They are giving Rs.4,000 to Rs.6,000 only,” claims Narasimha, a tenant farmer.

617,2016-11-22,15.0,Campaign for circulating small currency catches up,"Campaign by many educated persons on social media for circulating small currency to help street vendors and petty businessmen not to suffer post-demonetisation is catching up. Micro-blogging sites like Whatsapp, Facebook and Twitter are being used to spread the word after noticing that some consumers are trying to make small purchases by insisting on change by producing newly launched Rs.2,000 notes. Secretary of Steel Executives’ Association Anil Kumar said in a Whatsapp post: “Please buy items you need like fruits and vegetables from small vendors and not from malls or super markets. We can easily use cards, but for them, getting 100 rupees for a few days is tough and will help them reinvest again in their business. Buy some from them, may be for just 100 rupees per day or on alternate days and it will help them in a big way. Thank you and please forward to others as well.” For want of change, many in Rythu Bazaars, fish markets at Fishing Harbour, MVP Colony, Railway New Colony, Gajuwaka and Ukkunagaram are facing untold hardship. As realty sector has been hit hard, daily wage workers are not able to earn anything. Faced with dull sales during Karthika Masam, fish vendors are finding it difficult to meet their both ends met. “Many come to us and offer Rs.2,000 notes for a purchase of Rs.200. There are some who insist that we should accept old Rs.500 notes,” remarked Pydamma, who sells fish at Nehru Bazaar for past 30 years. “The need is not to hide small currency notes and coins at home. We should circulate them into the market so as to help street vendors and small-time businessmen,” said AP Chambers of Commerce and Industry State president-elect G. Sambasiva Rao. Mr. Rao said high value notes should be used only during transactions made at malls and big shops. As it is, he said one should prefer to shift to digital mode by making payment from digital wallets or credit/debit cards. Fishermen activist and advocate Ganta Papa Rao said it was responsibility of every citizen not to trouble roadside vendors and before making any purchase, it was better to come prepared with Rs.50 and Rs.100 notes to offer them.

618,2016-11-22,15.0,Hoarders ?cash? in on demonetisation,"Black money hoarders in Adilabad seem to be posing an additional problem for bankers, that of weeding out the pre-2005 currency notes from the demonetised Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,000. They are trying to take advantage of the current system and slipping the pre-2005 notes, which were banned by the Reserve Bank of India in 2014, aiming to exchange them for legal tender. The issue has been noticed by bankers here, but nothing much is being done about it as they are under tremendous pressure owing to demonetisation. They are, however, able to weed out such currency thanks to the note counting machines which are programmed to detect the silver thread pieces printed before 2005. The chief cashier at State Bank of Hyderabad, Adilabad main branch, K. Dharmender, singled out one note when an individual came to him to exchange demonetised notes. “This has ceased to be legal tender since long,” he admonished the person on Saturday. A few days earlier, the staff at Andhra Bank in the town found an individual trying to deposit a few Rs. 500 notes which were banned by the Reserve Bank of India in 2014. Some of the staff members took strong objection to it . In another instance which took place four days back, the note counting machine at Indian Bank beeped furiously as it detected pieces of lapsed currency notes in a bundle which was submitted by a seed dealer to be deposited in his account. The dealer, who swore the money was given to him by farmers, ended up poorer by Rs. 4,500 as the machine refused to accept 7 of the Rs. 500 notes and one of the Rs. 1,000 bill as they belonged to the series which were banned two years back and can now be exchanged only at the RBI. According to bankers, the number of older banned notes is much smaller where an individual is concerned, but considerably higher when big business houses or industrialists come into play. Though the old money left with hoarders cannot be quantified at this stage, it is being assumed that they were left with huge stockpiles of the silver thread currency having failed to exchange in the earlier instance, they point out. The cotton market in Adilabad is an ideal place to launder even the older scrapped currency notes as farmers are being paid in Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,000 notes.

TNCC president Su. Thirunavukkarasar said that meetings were held outside various central government offices in all districts. The protest in Chennai was organised adjacent to the district collector’s office. He said that the protest would not be a one-day affair as “Modi will give us more chances.” He blamed both the Central and State governments for the plight of those who have been affected by demonetisation. “We do not know if the Tamil Nadu government is walking, sitting or sleeping at this moment. It is a bad government,” he said. He reminded his audience that it was Rahul Gandhi who had raised the issue of demonetisation as a people’s problem. “The PM will have to be a family man to know how this move affects families,” he said. Mr. Thirunavukkarasar’s predecessor E.V.K.S. Elangovan criticised the move, saying it had been done without any planning. “People who support this move ask why there haven’t been more protests against it. How can the people protest when their stomachs are empty,” he said.

620,2016-11-22,15.0,Capital?s scrap market feels the heat of demonetisation,"Worried:Garbage collectors like Alam are a concerned lot as scrap dealers have no change to pay them for the waste plastic and metallic scrap they collect.Photo: Special Arrangement
  The little space outside Alam’s shanty, where he would relax after a long day of collecting household waste from door-to-door, is dotted with empty plastic bottles and metallic scrap. These heaps of plastic waste are only getting bigger with each passing day, as are the lines on Alam’s forehead. After repeatedly trying to call someone, the 20-year-old turns to his mother and says, “Phone abhi bhi band hai [the mobile phone is still switched off].” Shutting shop Most shops that deal in scrap near Seemapuri slums in north-east Delhi, which is where Alam lives with his family, have shut shop since Prime Minister Narendra Modi demonetised the Rs.1,000 and Rs.500 currency notes. The reason being that the scrap dealers have no change to pay for the waste plastic they buy from garbage collectors. Caught off-guard “The few shops that are open are buying it for half the price and forcing us to accept old notes. What do we do with these notes?” said Alam, the youngest of five siblings. The news of demonetisation took Alam and his family by surprise. Their immediate worry was the few thousand rupees they had saved over the past few years. A day after the announcement, Alam was among those who lined up outside a bank with Rs.10,000 in his pocket. “There was a huge rush. Like hundreds others, I skipped work and stood in a line to exchange the old notes. My turn didn’t come. I went again the next day and waited several hours, only to be told that I couldn’t get Rs.10,000 exchanged, and that I would have to deposit the money instead. I came back empty-handed as I don’t have an account,” he said. So demoralised were Alam and his family that they joined their neighbours in an impromptu protest. Reality, however, dawned on Alam the next day when he required the new currency to take care of his family’s daily expenses. His family includes two differently-abled nephews.

He was in for a shock when he reached the market the next day. “The shopkeepers refused to accept the new currency. They claimed not to have change.

PCC president Sachin Pilot, who held a meeting of the party leaders to discuss the issue, said people were facing a tough time due to the currency crisis and no relief measures were taken by the government for the convenience of people who are lined up in queues to exchange currency notes. Referring to various reports, he said that close to 100 people have died due to the decision of the government and people have to wait for hours in bank queues to change the notes. “Production and business in the entire country has been badly affected. Daily wagers are without work, farmers are not getting buyers for their agriculture produce and they also have no money to buy seeds and fertilizers which would create crisis of food in the days to come,” Mr. Pilot said. He said that the government’s decision to not charge toll tax should be continued and free distribution of ration should be there in slum areas and to BPL families who are short of money. “There is resentment among people which is being ignored by the government. Trade and industry stakeholders are also in trouble due to the decision,” he said. Pilot said that the Congress welcomes the decision of demonetisation but the hardship faced by the people cannot be ignored or tolerated.

Hanumantha Rao said here on Monday. Prime Minister Narendra Modi demonetised the higher denominations notes without providing an alternative or putting in place proper method to compensate their absence in the market subjecting the people to a lot of hardships, Mr. Hanumantha Rao said at a press conference. There were also divergent statements on the situation coming under control. While Mr. Modi said it would take about 40 days, Union Minister M.

623,2016-11-22,15.0,Flower business takes a hit post-demonetisation,"The usually bustling flower market in the century-old Devaraja Market has seen a drop in its business since over a week after the Union government demonetised Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,000 notes. This is the time when florists and flower designers usually work overtime to meet the orders for weddings, village festivals and so on. Even retail business has registered dull business. Flower business has recorded a 50-60 per cent drop owing to the currency crisis in the aftermath of the demonetisation of Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,000 notes, claim flower vendors who are into the business since many years. Mujahid Pasha, a flower designer at the market, said, “Those engaged in flower decorations and garland-making used to get a lot of orders, especially in November, from Mysuru and other places in view of weddings. I heard people are putting off weddings owing to cash crunch and this has impacted our business too.” Jasmine price falls With the fall in demand for flowers, jasmine growers are not getting suitable price for their produce. Despite the fall in production, jasmine is being sold at Rs. 350-400 a kg whose price should have been in such a situation between Rs. 1,000 and Rs. 1,200 a kg, flower vendors said. Moreover, supply of jasmine variety from Tamil Nadu, which is among the popular variety and an integral part of flower business here, has been affected post-demonetisation. “The daily supply from cities and towns bordering the State has been cut owing to currency shortage. The vendors don’t give credit and this is one issue which needs to be addressed soon,” said Noor Pasha, a flower vendor. Noor Pasha said both wholesale and retail business has been dull. “Owing to the issue of change, retail business has seen a fall since we don’t have sufficient change for transactions for a higher denomination note,” Noor Pasha added. Khalid, a flower decorator, who along with Mujahid Pasha designs decorative garlands, said a bunch of ornamental roses, which used to cost Rs. 150 (for 20 pieces), is now available for Rs. 40 a bunch. “You can just imagine how the scenario is. Remember, this is the marriage season and the demand should have been more,” he added. For Swamy Gowda and Raje Gowda and Kumara hailing from Bookanakere hobli and Hoskote respectively, who have grown chrysanthemum, their daily earnings from flowers have fallen by 50 per cent. The market has been flooded with chrysanthemum, but there is no demand and not many takers. “After paying to labourers for plucking flowers in the fields, we end up earning a meagre Rs. 100 a day growing flowers. Glut and currency crisis has eaten into our revenue,” claim the growers, while searching for flower buyers opposite the Dufferin Clock here.

The petition has been moved by Pooja Mahajan, who runs a showroom here. Ms. Mahajan has said that since the two notes have been declared as illegal tender, the government cannot direct hospitals and petrol pumps to accept the old notes. The petitioner has also urged that the new Rs.2,000 note be discontinued. The petitioner’s counsel pleaded that the matter needed urgent hearing as Ms. Mahajan was facing a problem earning her livelihood and it was an infringement of her fundamental rights. ‘Against the Constitution’ The petitioner urged the court to quash various notifications regarding demonetisation, saying they are in contravention of the Constitution and the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) Act. Section 24 of the RBI Act deals with denomination of notes, which empowers the RBI and the Centre to issue bank notes of various denominations as mentioned in Section 24 (1) and (2) of the Act, the plea said. “Till date, the government has not issued any notification under Section 24 (2) of the RBI Act for discontinuing currency notes of Rs.500 and Rs.1,000,” the plea said, adding that the Rs.2,000 notes were being circulated by the government against the mandate of Section 24(1). The petitioner also alleged that “on the pretext of exchange of notes, the government cannot prosecute and misuse the provisions of the Income Tax Act by treating the cash deposit for exchange as unaccounted money”.

Speaking to the media persons, he said the co-operative banking sector was the worst-hit as the availability of money made was less. “Co-operative banking sector is the backbone of the rural India and the Banking Regulation Act that govern the commerical banks is applicable to it. Now that the khariff season has ended, the farmers have no money to give to the farm hands. To raise the second crop they have no money to buy seed, pesticides and fertilizers,” he said. He blamed the Centre for its ham-handed executing of demonetisation exercise and felt that more number of Rs. 500 and Rs. 100 notes must have been available to the public. “Releasing Rs. 2,000 is a big mistake. No one is giving change for Rs. 2,000 and for the past 12 days people across India are suffering. The badly hit are those in the lower section of the society,” he said.

  Like bank employees, fuel outlet attendants too have had a harrowing time these past few days since people come to them with notes of large denominations. Many of them said their patience was exhausted talking to customers who were often rude in their demand for change. “Most of the middle class customers have exhausted their Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,000 notes and are bringing in Rs. 2,000 notes. If they tank up for Rs. 1,000, we are forced to give them Rs. 1,000 in change and that would mean ten notes of Rs. 100, which is just not possible,” said a fuel pump attendant. Fuel outlet managers said they were not getting enough change from banks though they knew their sales volume was high. “We easily require around Rs. 30,000 in notes of Rs. 100 a day. But we get notes for only Rs. 5,000-Rs. 6,000 and that too from other customers. Some people wait for a few minutes so that we can get Rs. 100 notes when others pay. But some others just refuse to wait and they also don’t tell us they have only notes of higher denominations. We cannot take back the petrol just because we don’t have change,” said an outlet manager. Added to this is the recent announcement that cash can be withdrawn using electronic data capturing machines.

636,2016-11-23,16.0,Impact of demonetisation hits milk producers too,"Milk producers across Mysuru district have not been spared from the impact of demonetisation. The cooperative milk producers’ societies had been finding it difficult to pay producers once a week or 10 days upon getting payment to their respective bank accounts from the Mysore Milk Union owing to the ceiling fixed on cash withdrawal. Since the withdrawal limit a week had been fixed at Rs. 24,000, the societies have been unable to withdraw sufficient cash to pay milk producers registered under it. The producers’ are either given part payment or their consent taken to transfer money to their accounts if they don’t need the money immediately. Though almost all the milk producers have bank accounts since the government subsidy of Rs. 4 a litre was directly credited to their accounts, the producers mostly prefer cash payments owing to limited banking facility. Sources at the Mysuru Milk Union told The Hindu that the societies had been asked to manage the crisis locally and credit the producers’ payment to their accounts henceforth. “Milk producers have been affected by the cash crisis. Each society gets at least Rs. 1 lakh a week as payment towards milk supply to the union. With the withdrawal limit being Rs. 24,000 a week, it is difficult to make payments to all,” the sources said. About 89,580 milk producers are registered with the Mysuru union, which procures milk from them daily through the milk producers’ cooperative societies. Mysuru district alone has over 950 cooperative milk producers’ societies. The union’s current daily milk procurement stands at 6.5 lakh litres. Production had been affected owing to drought and scarcity of fodder. An officer at the Mysore Milk Union said that around Rs. 7 crore was paid to producers through their respective societies once a week or within 10 days. “By and large, cash transactions had been most preferred by the producers as many are averse to visiting banks for deposits or withdrawals. The currency crisis and restrictions in withdrawal for farmers’ cooperatives are being managed locally,” he said.

638,2016-11-23,16.0,Ensure circulation of small currencynotes: Rayapati,"Tirumala: Rayapati Sambasiva Rao, Member of Parliament from Narasaraopet constituency, on Wednesday urged the government to ensure availability of the lower denomination notes like Rs.500 and Rs.100 to all sections of the society failing which there would be a civil war-like situation in the country. The new Rs.1,000 currency note which the government was planning to introduce also should be made available to the public, he said. “Though the demonetisation move is good for the country, the scarcity of lower denomination currency notes has aggravated the problems of the people. The government should immediately review the situation that has led to the severe cash crunch and pump sufficient money into the bank chests and ATMs,” he said. In reply to a question, the MP said that Chief Minister N. Chandrababu Naidu already appealed to the Centre to rush lower denomination currency notes to help the State overcome the cash crisis. “There is no use of the newly introduced Rs.2,000 note. You can’t even buy a plate of idly with the high denomination note as the hoteliers are demanding only lower currency notes at their eateries,” the MP said.

Post demonetisation, the total balance on Jan Dhan accounts stood at Rs 66,636 crore. As of November 9 — the day from which higher denomination currency ceased to be legal tender — the balance in about 25.5 crore such accounts was Rs 45,636.61 crore. On November 8, Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced demonetisation of 500 and 1,000 rupee notes and since then, long queues before banks and post offices are seen to deposit or exchange these currencies. Mamata Banerjee-ruled West Bengal leads the pack of States, which has seen the highest deposits so far followed by Karnataka. With a view to increasing banking penetration and promoting financial inclusion and with the main objective of covering all households with at least one bank account per household across the country, Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojna (PMJDY) was launched on August 28, 2014. Such accounts have a deposit limit of Rs 50,000. Earlier, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley had said the government is looking into sudden ‘popping up’ of money into zero-balance Jan Dhan accounts.

  Demonetisation of Rs. 500 and Rs. 1000 notes is likely to affect 82nd Akhila Bharata Kannada Sahitya Sammelan scheduled to be held in the first week of December in Raichur in more than one way. As per well-placed sources closely associated with the organisation of the literary event, the target of mobilising Rs. 2 crore from local sources cannot be met as the potential donors - businessmen, rice mill owners, traders and alike – themselves are in financial trouble. “Businessmen usually donate in cash as they have huge unaccounted money which is normally in the form of Rs. 500 and Rs. 1000 notes. With the demonetisation of these high value notes, they are unable to make donations. They are not so generous to donate their accounted money through cheques and electronic transfer. The major source of fund mobilisation has thus dried up with the demonetisation,” an organiser associated with the Sammelana activities said. Sasikanth S. Senthil, Deputy Commissioner of Raichur, who looks after financial matters, is confident of organising the literary event with the funds provided by the State government. He is of the opinion that Rs. 4 crore that the government has allocated for the event is a “decent amount” for neat conduct of the event. Considering the demonetisation and resultant crunch of fund mobilisation, he has approached the potential donors appealing to them to offer their contributions in the form of goods and services required for the event instead of cash donations. “Hundreds of hotel rooms have been booked for providing accommodation to guests. In a normal condition, we would have collected donations and pay for the rooms. Now, upon our request in view of demonetisation, the hotel owners have agreed to provide rooms free of cost. Similarly, several other responsibilities and tasks that require money are being entrusted to many people,” Mr. Senthil told The Hindu. Vishnukanth Budadi of Shilpa Medicare Limited and Raichur Rice Millers Association have similarly agreed to provide food to guests and general public for three days, Mahantesh Maski, former district president of the Kannada Sahitya Parishat said. In order to manage with limited financial resources, the organising committee is planning drop many proposals to cut costs. “We will have to use the funds judiciously. We will put money on unavoidable expenditure such as erecting stage and cultural teams. We may have to avoid providing jackets to mediapersons and other such expenditures,” Mr. Senthil said. Using the surplus money after the Sammelana, a Kannada Bhavana is normally built for the parishat at the town where sahitya sammelan is organised. But this time, the organisers are not sure that they can save some money for purpose.

641,2016-11-23,16.0,"Villagers in Hassan district have new currency, but are unable to use it","The villagers in Hassan district are encountering a new problem with the introduction of Rs.2000 currency note. Many shopkeepers are refusing to accept the new currency as they do not have sufficient small denomination notes to give as change. As a result, there has been very minimum transactions. When The Hindu visited Shettinahalli on Wednesday afternoon, most of the shops in the village were either closed or half-closed. The common reason for closing the shops early in the day was non-availability of small denomination currency notes for daily transactions. The Canara Bank branch in the village does not have any other notes than Rs 2,000 currency notes. “Every person in the village has Rs.2,000 currency notes as no other note is being provided by the bank for last few days,” said William, who runs a retail shop in the village. Within a few minutes, at least eight people gathered at his shop to share their experience of having the Rs. 2,000 currency note, which is not accepted by many shops. Shivashankar of Manjunath Bakery in the village also closed his shop around 12 noon for the same reason. “Before the demonetisation came into effect I was doing a daily business of over Rs.2,000. Now it is not even Rs.200-300. Shoppers carry the new currency note and we do not have sufficient change,” he said. Similar was the opinion of Rajanna, who runs a hotel in the village. “Yesterday, two people came to my hotel for lunch. Before offering them lunch I enquired if they have sufficient change. They had only Rs. 2,000 note. I had no option but to send them back without food.” The villagers alleged that the bank officers were not cooperating with the villagers by making arrangements for small denomination currency notes. “I visited the bank with an intention to withdraw Rs.2,500. The bank officials told me that I can only withdraw either Rs.2,000 or Rs.4,000. I can’t get Rs.2,500 as they do not have currency notes of other denomination,” said Mari Joseph, a resident of the village. The majority of the villagers call the demonetisation process a way to penalise the poor, not the rich people with black money.

The milk production has come down by around one lakh litres per day owing to lack of green fodder and water. While the average milk procurement two-three months ago was around 10.80 lakh litres per day, the quantity now stands at around 9.80 lakh litres, Kochimul Managing Director N. Hanumesh told The Hindu on Wednesday. However, sale has not come down despite demonetisation. Kochimul’s daily sales stood at around 2.95 lakh litres. “The demonetisation process has not affected the dairy sector so far,” Mr. Hanumesh said. “Neither procurement nor sales was affected as we were allowed to take Rs. 500 and Rs. 1000 notes from the customers till November 24,” Mr. Hanumesh added.

    The Supreme Court on Wednesday refused to stay proceedings in cases filed in High Courts and lower courts against the demonetisation of Rs. 500 and Rs. 1000 notes. A bench. led by Chief Justice of India T.S. Thakur, said the petitions in the various courts highlight ""the different inconveniences highlighted in the various cases filed across the country, maybe some relief can be had by these people"". The Supreme Court had refused to ""shut its door"" to the ""frantic and affected"" public. The court allowed cash-starved co-operative banks to approach their respective High Courts for succour. The Centre, however, maintained that the demonetisation policy, an exercise meant to weed out black money and cripple terror funding, is a success. ""So is it [demonetisation] a success?"" Chief Justice Thakur asked Attorney General Mukul Rohatgi. ""No doubt. Rs. 6 lakh crore has been deposited in banks. The banks are flush with money and lending rates will come down,"" Mr Rohatgi responded. The AG said queues in front of banks and ATMS have thinned and the situation would resume normality in the next 20 days. The court asked whether farmers are able to buy seeds at the peak of the rabi season. Mr. Rohatgi informed that alternate arrangements have been made, special teams sent to all the States and the situation was monitored on an hourly basis. The Supreme Court issued notice to all petitoners on a Centre's plea to transfer all the demonetisation cases in various courts to either the apex court or an High Court, and not have it spread in courts all over the country. The court will have hearing on this aspect on December 2.

Official sources told The Hindu that the team members would hold discussion with bank officials, District Collector, officials of various departments and people from various walks of life to get a feedback on the situation from five different angles. The special team officials would initially check the currency availability in bank branches and ATMs across the district and the facilities set up at banks for withdrawal, deposit and exchange of currency notes. Already, widespread complaints were there from the industrial clusters across the district about the lack of adequate currencies in the ATMs with many of the machines remaining non-operational for long time. Even the ATM situated next door to the Lead Bank office in Tirupur Collectorate has not been opened for the past few days due to the non-availability of currencies especially in the denomination of Rs 100. The team members would then examine whether the calibration of the ATMs to dispense Rs. 2,000 and the new Rs. 500 currency notes was going at the desired pace. The impact of demonetisation on households, industrial and informal sectors, transportation, farmers and daily wage earners would be studied separately. A report will be submitted to the government on the situation, sources said.

| Photo Credit:  Special Arrangement Daily-wage labourers have been hit the hardest by the Centre’s decision to demonetise the Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,000 currency notes, as workers are not able to find work or are not being paid on time, said Ramon Magsaysay award winner Bezwada Wilson on Wednesday. Mr. Wilson said that no one is employing daily-wage labourers and other Safai-Karmachari (manual scavengers) who have been rehabilitated in the recent past. “Some of them who have become vegetable sellers are not seeing a huge dip in their business due to loss of customers. People who have money now either buy things online or prefer to use cash for other things,” he noted. Dalits real sufferers Mr. Wilson was in Hyderabad to address prison officials as part of a guest lecture at the Chanchalguda Central Jail. “The real sufferers of demonetisation are the poorest and the most marginalised like Dalits. Their lives have collapsed as people are getting a chance to tell them no and deny their daily earnings,” he asserted. On manual-scavenging, Mr. Wilson said that though the Supreme Court had passed an order in 2014 to all State Governments to pay Rs. 10 lakh to families of people who died while working in sewers, only a few States had paid the amount so far. “Punjab has paid some families the amount. Recently, the Tamil Nadu Government told the Supreme Court that it cannot pay the amount, but finally agreed,” he added. Biodegradable toilets He also said that the Indian Railways was the biggest employer of manual-scavengers, as a majority of the rain coaches still do not have biodegradable toilets. “About 500 coaches are being fitted with those toilets each year. There are about 1,70,000 train coaches currently. So fitting 500 of them a year will take many years to finish the task,” he pointed out.

646,2016-11-23,16.0,Demonetisation: Udupi Co-ops. Union to approach High Court,"Office-bearers of cooperative societies participating in a meeting to discuss reduced cash inflow in Udupi on Tuesday.
  The Udupi District Co-operatives Union on Tuesday decided to approach the High Court of Karnataka on the issue of reduced cash inflow to cooperative societies in the district due to the Union government’s move to demonetise Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,000 notes. Jayakar Shetty Indralli, director of the union, said that all the members of the union had agreed to approach the High Court on this issue as they had exhausted all other options. Earlier, addressing a meeting of the office-bearers of all co-operative societies of the district, Kishan Hegde Kolkebail, president of the Udupi District Co-operatives Union Ltd., said that the co-operative societies were choking due to the Union government’s demonetisation move. The co-operatives union was not against the demonetisation move. But this had reduced the cash inflow at cooperative societies drastically and it had become difficult for them to carry out their day-to-day business. The cash inflow to the societies was just 0.9 per cent. After the government demonetised Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,000 notes on November 8, the union had directed all co-operative societies not to accept these denomination notes for either deposits or loan repayment. With the result, most of the business of the societies had come to a standstill. The constant change of guidelines by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) on acceptance of currency notes had created an atmosphere of confusion. There were 53 agricultural credit co-operative societies and 253 credit co-operative societies in the district with over 3.75 lakh members. Most of the activities of the credit co-operative societies were concentrated in the rural areas. The societies were not able to provide services to the rural people after the demonetisation move. As money in circulation had gone down, loan repayment too was affected. For the last 12 days, it had become difficult for the societies to either provide money from the deposit-holders’ savings accounts. The District Co-operatives Union had approached both the Union and State governments and written several letters to them about the reduced cash inflow, but these attempts had not yielded any fruit. “All co-operative societies have enough funds to repay the depositors and there has been no Income Tax raids on any of the cooperative societies in the district. People should not get taken in by rumours,” Mr. Kolkebail said. S.K. Manjunath, Gopikrishna Rao, Chandrashekhar Shetty and Y. Sudhir Kumar, directors of the union, were present.

647,2016-11-23,16.0,Demonetisation leaves construction workers jobless,"A fallout of demonetisation is that construction industry has come to a grinding halt and labourers find the going tough. The Golden Jubilee Pillar roundabout in Tiruvannamalai is a labour shandy of sorts. Hundreds of construction workers from in and around Tiruvannamalai throng the place to be picked up by employers. In the morning, the place would be humming with activity. The spot popularly referred to as ‘park’ by construction workers these days wears a gloomy look with labourers anxiously waiting to be hired. Murugan, a mason from Kilipattu village, says, “I had no work all through last week. Somehow, I need to run my family. I accepted an old Rs.500 note. But I cannot stand the whole day in front of the bank to change it. Hence, I gave it to a shopkeeper. He agreed to take it on the condition that I purchase provisions for at least Rs.200. I had no option but to agree. I cannot blame it on either contractors or people, who construct buildings since they themselves have no money,” he said. Jayavel, also a mason, said only 20 out of hundred workers who turn up in the park get work. Several ongoing construction works were suspended, he says. Nehru, state president of Tamil Maanila Kattida Thozhilalar Sangam, based in Tiruvannamalai, a labour contractor, says he normally employed 50-60 labours a day at different project sites. But now he could hardly employ 10 per cent of them. “Almost all the projects I have been involved in have been completely suspended. As far as construction of houses is concerned, house owners could not mobilise money in smaller currencies. We need to give wages in cash and no other form is acceptable to labours. It became impossible to buy materials with little cash to spare,” he added. Hardware and cement shops too face a slump. Subashchandrabose, proprietor of a hardware shop, said that they virtually had no business ever since the demonetisation was launched. “We get only a little fraction of our original business, that too in small volumes. People are ready to buy only if we accept old Rs.1,000 and Rs.500 notes. We don’t how long we can manage. We need to pay labourers, rent, electricity etc. It has definitely affected businessmen, workers and contractors”. M. Srinivasan, another merchant selling cement, hardware and paints said, “Eighty per cent of business has gone. Nobody wants to start new construction. Ongoing works continue only in pockets. The sales has slumped drastically”.

649,2016-11-23,16.0,Modi destabilised many sectors with demonetisation: Chinta Mohan,"CHITTOOR: Former Union Minister and senior Congress leader P. Chinta Mohan on Tuesday flayed Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Chief minister Chandrababu Naidu over demonetisation issue, and predicted that the NDA government at the Centre and the TDP government in AP would be routed in 2019 elections. Addressing a press conference here, Mr. Chinta Mohan said that the demonetisation of big currency had affected over 80% of people in India, particularly the agrarian and urban poor. He observed that the adverse impact of demonetisation would take over six years to clear. ""The Modi government move had destabilised the health, business, agriculture and allied sectors in the country,"" he said. The former MP said that the prime intention of Modi in announcing demonetisation of big currency was to encourage the corporate sector as he was hand in glove with them. Modi was spreading falsehood that he was a tea-master. ""In fact, Modi never sold tea. He was fostered by the RSS and he happened to work in a tea bunk for a while. He is also a school dropout at fourth class, but got his degrees while he was the Chief Minister of Gujarat,"" Mr. Chinta Mohan said. The Congress leader alleged that Modi was anti-poor, as he had over five thousand dress materials worth over Rs 50 crore. Terming Modi as ""icon of black money,"" Mr. Chinta Mohan alleged that during 2014 elections, Modi had pooled up black money to the tune of Rs 3,000 crore and the deal was struck with corporate groups at a star hotel in New Delhi. ""As Advani could not move ahead with the deal of pooling up black money, he lost the opportunity of becoming the Prime minster and the post went in favour of Modi,"" the Congress leader alleged. ""At present, there is a rethinking on Modi leadership in BJP, and some are favouring Rajnath Singh to be their future leader. The Cabinet colleagues are facing a tough time with Modi as he doesn’t bother at all to respect their feelings,"" Mr. Chinta Mohan maintained. Referring to AP, the former MP faulted Chandrababu Naidu for his stand on demonetisation. ""Mr. Naidu is frequently going to New Delhi to prompt handing over of a private port in Srikakulam to Modi's associate Gowtham Adani. Naidu exposed his corruption with Rs. 11 crore deposits in his infant grandson's account,"" he said. The former Union minister demanded that the Centre should take prompt steps to issue salaries to all employees, besides overcoming the adverse impact of demonetisation in 15 days. He also opposed the AP government's move to merge the Sri City SEZ in Chittoor district with Nellore district, allegedly to help foster the interests of Municipal Administration Minister P. Narayana.

650,2016-11-23,16.0,Currency crisis: Aqua business in Krishna district badly affected,"Demonetisation has paralysed the flourishing aqua business in Krishna district where export of the freshwater fish production has come to a halt. Harvesting of two freshwater fish species – rohu and catla – had to be postponed in over one lakh hectares of aqua ponds and in the areas of its neighbouring West Godavari district. Rohu and catla are the most economically important fish species which are cultivated in Krishna district. Above 80 per cent of the production of freshwater fish species is being exported to Kolkata and Odisha states. “Price of rohu and catla at the domestic market has fallen drastically owning to the impact of demonetisation. Price fall The price fall of the two species this year is 20 per cent when compared to the last season,” Central Institute of Freshwater Aquaculture senior scientist B. Seshagiri has told The Hindu. However, Mr. Seshagiri has opined that the impact of the demonetisation will be less on those who could manage the expenditure to postpone the harvesting of the fish. Ironically, farmers of Kaikaluru, Mandavalli and other areas surrounding the Kolleru lake are the worst affected as freshwater aquaculture has been thriving in this region over the years. Aquaculture farmers have observed they are unable to provide work to those who depend on aquaculture due to lack of work in the wake of postponement of fish harvesting. Several thousands of workers directly depend on aquaculture ponds for daily wages including collection and loading of the fish.

The TDP took the credit for demonetisation claiming that Mr. Naidu had advised Prime Minister Narendra Modi on pulling out of the higher denomination notes. The party was trying to shift the blame to the Centre after the move backfired resulting in huge public outcry. “There is no point in criticising the Centre as long as the TDP continues to be an alliance partner of the NDA. It has to take the blame equally,” he said. Referring to the alleged sale of shares of Heritage Group owned by Mr. Naidu’s family ahead of the announcement on demonetisation, he faulted Agriculture Minister P. Pulla Rao for trying to defend the move. The Minister was speaking like spokesperson of the company or else how could anyone justify the significant rise in share price of the company in just two and a half years, he asked.

653,2016-11-23,16.0,"Currency crisis: GCC sale, retail business down by 50 per cent","Demonetisation has cast its shadow on the retail sale of Girijan Cooperative Corporation, which is known for bringing nature’s purity to homes since its inception in 1956 and providing remunerative price to tribal forest-dwellers across the State. Retail sale of its products, including highly popular Girijan honey, flower tamarind, red rajma, turmeric powder, shikakai, soapnut and ‘Triphala churnam’ have come down by 50 per cent since the announcement of demonetisation of high-value notes from the midnight of November 8. GCC was formed to rescue tribal forest-dwellers from the clutches of middlemen who used to exploit them taking advantage of their innocence. It procures non-timber forest produce from them by offering remunerative price. The retail sale has come down by 50 per cent. GCC has set a target of Rs.367 crore for 2016-17 of which the retail sale is estimated at Rs.35 crore. It also sells essential commodities like kerosene, rice, oil and pulses through depots run by it in all tribal villages. The turnover from the depots is originally expected to cross Rs.150 crore in addition to Rs.100 crore from fuel stations. Sale at fuel stations, managed by GCC, has not been hit as they are accepting old notes as per the government directive. Digital transactions GCC Vice-Chairman-cum-Managing Director A.S.P.S. Ravi Prakash told The Hindu on Tuesday that they had taken the demonetisation move and the subsequent currency crisis as a challenge and are taking steps on a war-footing for popularising digital transactions. “We are in talks with banks and initiating measures to install swiping machines at retail outlets including our shops run at Millennium Bunk, Ushodaya junction and Gajuwaka in the city. At the franchisee outlets across Andhra Pradesh, we want to install swiping machines.” Mr. Ravi Prakash said they were also keen on accepting digital wallets so as to popularise e-payments at all the outlets in the cities and towns. On the whole, GCC target for the current fiscal might be hit by 20 per cent with indications that the currency crisis will be set right in a few days.

654,2016-11-23,16.0,Steel flyover vs. demonetisation,"The Legislative Assembly on Tuesday saw the Opposition BJP and the Congress choosing steel flyover and demonetisation issues, respectively, to politically outsmart each other. Irked over BJP member C.T. Ravi’s remarks that the government has given more attention to construction of the controversial steel flyover in Bengaluru and paid only a lip service to drought in villages, the Congress members raised the issue of demonetisation. Participating in the discussion on drought and drinking water problem, Mr. Ravi remarked: “Let the government build a steel or silver flyover when there is abundance wealth. But now, more than three-fourths of the taluks in the State have been declared drought-hit and there is no need to spend on construction of the flyover.” Congress members countered by saying that farmers have not been able to withdraw money from their accounts and purchase seeds and other inputs owing to demonetisation. The Centre was more responsible for sufferings of rural people, said Bengaluru Development Minister K.J. George and Transport Minister Ramalinga Reddy. This resulted in a heated exchange of words between the Congress and the BJP members. Earlier, Opposition JD (S) members sought permission to discuss the impact of demonetisation on District Credit Co-operative Banks through an adjournment motion. When the Speaker asked them to wait till the completion of discussion on drought, JD(S) members trooped into the well of the House and commenced a dharna leading to adjournment of the House for some time.

655,2016-11-23,16.0,Demonetisation drive leaves construction workers jobless,"A fallout of demonetisation is that construction industry has come to a grinding halt and labourers find the going tough. The Golden Jubilee Pillar roundabout in Tiruvannamalai is a labour shandy of sorts. Hundreds of construction workers from in and around Tiruvannamalai throng the place to be picked up by employers. In the morning, the place would be humming with activity. The spot popularly referred to as ‘park’ by construction workers these days wears a gloomy look with labourers anxiously waiting to be hired. Murugan, a mason from Kilipattu village, says, “I had no work all through last week. Somehow, I need to run my family. I accepted an old Rs.500 note. But I cannot stand the whole day in front of the bank to change it. Hence, I gave it to a shopkeeper. He agreed to take it on the condition that I purchase provisions for at least Rs.200. I had no option but to agree. I cannot blame it on either contractors or people, who construct buildings since they themselves have no money,” he said. Jayavel, also a mason, said only 20 out of hundred workers who turn up in the park get work. Several ongoing construction works were suspended, he says. Nehru, state president of Tamil Maanila Kattida Thozhilalar Sangam, based in Tiruvannamalai, a labour contractor, says he normally employed 50-60 labours a day at different project sites. But now he could hardly employ 10 per cent of them. “Almost all the projects I have been involved in have been completely suspended. As far as construction of houses is concerned, house owners could not mobilise money in smaller currencies. We need to give wages in cash and no other form is acceptable to labours. It became impossible to buy materials with little cash to spare,” he added. Hardware and cement shops too face a slump. Subashchandrabose, proprietor of a hardware shop, said that they virtually had no business ever since the demonetisation was launched. “We get only a little fraction of our original business, that too in small volumes. People are ready to buy only if we accept old Rs.1,000 and Rs.500 notes. We don’t how long we can manage. We need to pay labourers, rent, electricity etc. It has definitely affected businessmen, workers and contractors”. M. Srinivasan, another merchant selling cement, hardware and paints said, “Eighty per cent of business has gone. Nobody wants to start new construction. Ongoing works continue only in pockets. The sales has slumped drastically”.

656,2016-11-23,16.0,?Daily labourers hardest hit by demonetisation?,"Daily-wage labourers have been hit the hardest by the Centre’s decision to demonetise the Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,000 currency notes, as workers are not able to find work or are not being paid on time, said Ramon Magsaysay award winner Bezwada Wilson on Wednesday. Mr. Wilson said that no one is employing daily-wage labourers and other Safai-Karmachari (manual scavengers) who have been rehabilitated in the recent past. “Some of them who have become vegetable sellers are not seeing a huge dip in their business due to loss of customers. People who have money now either buy things online or prefer to use cash for other things,” he noted. Dalits real sufferers Mr. Wilson was in Hyderabad to address prison officials as part of a guest lecture at the Chanchalguda Central Jail. “The real sufferers of demonetisation are the poorest and the most marginalised like Dalits. Their lives have collapsed as people are getting a chance to tell them no and deny their daily earnings,” he asserted. On manual-scavenging, Mr. Wilson said that though the Supreme Court had passed an order in 2014 to all State Governments to pay Rs. 10 lakh to families of people who died while working in sewers, only a few States had paid the amount so far. “Punjab has paid some families the amount. Recently, the Tamil Nadu Government told the Supreme Court that it cannot pay the amount, but finally agreed,” he added. Biodegradable toilets He also said that the Indian Railways was the biggest employer of manual-scavengers, as a majority of the rain coaches still do not have biodegradable toilets. “About 500 coaches are being fitted with those toilets each year. There are about 1,70,000 train coaches currently. So fitting 500 of them a year will take many years to finish the task,” he pointed out.

657,2016-11-23,16.0,Demonetisation: Tribals too feel the pinch,"Thousands of tribal people feel the pinch of the demonetisation of Rs.1,000 and Rs.500 notes as they are not able to sell their produce for the last two weeks. They are also facing trouble in depositing and exchanging their money in banks. Around 3,000 families out of 12,500 in the tribal mandals under ITDA-Sithampet region could get Jan-Dhan bank accounts under the financial inclusion programme. NABARD and local NGOs had explained them the benefits of the banking system and made them to open accounts in nearby mandal headquarters such as Sithampet, Palakonda, Kotturu, Bhamini, and Veeraghattam. However, they have to travel at least 30 km to reach the bank from hilly areas. Many villages do not have road network and transport facility. In fact, many farmers have regular income with the sale of their produce in shandies in places like Sithampet, Kusumi, Polla, and Dhonubhai. Price fall “We used to get around Rs.8 per piece of cauliflower. Its price has gone down to Rs.5 with the traders reluctant to buy them due to non-availability of Rs.100 notes. Many of them are not taking even on credit basis as they are also facing troubles to transport them to cities like Srikakulam and Visakhapatnam,” says Arika Durgarao, a tribal farmer in Kotturu. “With great difficulty, we could arrange Rs.800, all Rs.100 notes, to families in places like Dhonubhai and Kusumi. The local trader agreed to take old currency notes and give Rs.100 notes to the needy families,” says Nuka Sanyasi Rao, director of ARTS, a non-governmental organisation. Plea to ITDA People’s representatives of all parties urged the ITDA to provide exchange of notes for the tribal families since a majority of them don’t have banking facility. Srikakulam Collector P. Lakshmi Narasimham has suggested the ITDA officials to reach out to them with the support of designated business correspondents of the banks concerned.

658,2016-11-23,16.0,Tackling demonetisation,"Since the announcement of demonetisation of Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,000 notes, commercial establishments, retail outlets, and small-scale vendors are looking at various options for customers to make payments without any hindrance. Several options that are becoming popular are online transfer, pre-paid cards, use of credit or debit cards and mobile wallets. Banks are promoting their online and mobile banking facilities. Be it cab drivers or roadside vendors, many are starting to explore these options as they face shortage of cash, especially of smaller denominations. However, customers who need cash for daily purchases and payments are finding it difficult to withdraw the required money as ATMs are not operating in most places and banks are unable to meet the entire fund requirement of the customers who want to withdraw cash. In an effort to help the public locate the nearest ATMs with cash, several crowd sourced tools have been introduced. cashnocash.com is one such popular tool. When the pincode is typed by a user, it lists the nearby ATMs and also says whether these have cash or not. The users can update the site based on their experience at the ATM. Another is ATMBot, developed by Coimbatore-based start-up Timebender Technologies. Within 48 years of launch, 6,000 customers were served and so far about 15,000. In this too, the information is crowd-sourced. The users withdraw cash and click a button on ATMBot, a web robot that runs inside Facebook’s messenger, to say whether the ATM had cash or not. The data is real-time, says its CEO Abishek. (Reporting by M.

Official sources told The Hindu that the team members would hold discussion with bank officials, District Collector, officials of various departments and people from various walks of life to get a feedback on the situation from five different angles. The special team officials would initially check the currency availability in bank branches and ATMs across the district and the facilities set up at banks for withdrawal, deposit and exchange of currency notes. Already, widespread complaints were there from the industrial clusters across the district about the lack of adequate currencies in the ATMs with many of the machines remaining non-operational for long time. Even the ATM situated next door to the Lead Bank office in Tirupur Collectorate has not been opened for the past few days due to the non-availability of currencies especially in the denomination of Rs 100. The team members would then examine whether the calibration of the ATMs to dispense Rs. 2,000 and the new Rs. 500 currency notes was going at the desired pace. The impact of demonetisation on households, industrial and informal sectors, transportation, farmers and daily wage earners would be studied separately. A report will be submitted to the government on the situation, sources said.

CPI(M) district secretary Sharanabasappa Mamshetty, in a memorandum addressed to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, demanded that Rs. 1,000 and Rs. 500 notes are allowed in transactions up to December 31 till alternative arrangements were in place. He urged the government to accept the decision taken at the CPI(M) politburo meeting, led by the Kerala and Tripura governments, and to allow for the transaction of high-value currency till December 31. “The common man has been largely affected with the Union government’s decision to demonetise high-value currency. This drive was implemented without proper planning. The government could have brought in structural reforms through tax administration to unearth black money hoarders,” Mr. Mamshetty said and added that that the government had opened the doors to allow for the doubling of corruption by introducing Rs. 2000 notes.

Party candidate Pradan Barua won the Lakhaimpur LS seat by a margin of 1,90,219 votes defeating his nearest rival Congress’s Hema Prasanga Pegu by a convincing 1,90,219 votes, the returning officer said. BJP retained the seat, which was earlier held by Chief Minister Sarbananda Sonowal who quit it to contest the Majuli assembly seat in April this year and take on the reins of the state. Mansing Rongpi won the Baithalangso Assembly seat. While he retained the seat, BJP won the seat as the contestant had resigned from Congress to join it in July which necessitated the by—poll this year. Rongpi defeated his nearest Congress rival Ruponsing Ronghang by 16,600 votes. Rongpi garnered 72,160 votes, while Ronghang polled 55,560 votes, said the returning officer. Meanwhile, Mr Sonowal termed the BJP’s win as the “mandate” of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s decision to demonetise the Rs 1,000 and Rs 500 notes. “BJP’s victory in by-polls is a clear indication that people are fully supporting the decision to demonetise Rs 1,000 and Rs 500 notes. It is people’s mandate for the Prime Minister’s decision of demonetisation,” he told reporters here. The Chief Minister said people responded overwhelmingly in support of Modi’s call for eradicating black money and a clear indication that the BJP-led governments at the Centre and Assam were performing well. The BJP has won the recently held by-polls in Lakhimpur Lok Sabha constituency and Baithalangshu Assembly seat. Sonowal met the Prime Minister and appealed him to ensure monitoring of construction of fencing along the Indo-Bangladesh border through Army for speedy completion. The Chief Minister also discussed with the Prime Minister a spectrum of issues ranging from demonetisation to law and order situation in Assam. He apprised Mr Modi of different steps the State government has taken with the help of the Reserve Bank of India to facilitate smooth flow of new currency notes in every nook and corner of the state in the wake of demonetisation of high currency notes. - PTI Printable version | Jan 7, 2017 1:31:09 AM | http://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/%E2%80%98BJP-wins-mandate-on-demonetisation%E2%80%99/article16722513.ece © The Hindu The Hindu revisits the gruesome December 2012 gang-rape to examine if Delhi is any safer for the average woman today"

This exemption should apply equally for payments at private hospitals too. We hope the government will step in quickly to resolve this anomaly,” said Manish Mattoo, Zonal Director of Fortis Hospitals, who recently wrote to the Centre in this regard. Meanwhile, all private hospitals have relented on accepting payments from patients through cheque, online transfers or net banking. Sudarshan Ballal, Chairman of Manipal Hospitals, said following the new rule, the hospital has seen a 20 per cent dip in patient flow. “Apart from accepting cheques, which we normally don’t, and allowing online and debit/credit payments, we are also facilitating opening of bank accounts for patients in our hospital’s bank so that they can deposit payments easily,” he said. Some hospitals are also offering discretionary credit to patients. Sudhir Pai, Executive Director and Chief Executive Officer of Vikram Hospital, said the hospital is accepting cheques (including post-dated), online transfers, RTGS and card payment.

663,2016-11-23,16.0,"Post-demonetisation, marriage a knotty affair","Marriages at the time of demonetisation, marked by cash crunch and restriction on withdrawals from banks, are presenting hard times to families in the State. Arun V. John, a young banker, is nervous as his marriage is drawing closer. With just four more days for the wedding, it is the clearing of bills of the ceremony that worries him the most. Though he had completed all major purchases earlier, he is struggling to raise funds to meet the expenses related to the wedding reception. Meeting the bills of the caterer, the local guy who has erected shamiana, and at cake shop will be a tough call as their payments have to be made in cash, he said. Similarly, V.K. Prasad, a former banker, whose daughter is getting married next week, is in a dilemma. “The Reserve Bank of India’s condition that only one party in a marriage can withdraw Rs. 2.5 lakh from the bank has put me in a fix. If I withdraw money as suggested by the bank, it will inconvenience the bridegroom’s family,” said a worried Mr. Prasad. “One needs cash for meeting minor marriage expenses such as painting, home maintenance, and small purchases where online transactions are not possible,” he said. The conditions would hit hard those who have raised loans and the amount had been transferred to their bank accounts after November 8, the day demonetisation was announced, he said. Though most of the upmarket marriage halls in Ernakulam accept online payments, it is not the case with most of the medium-sized halls where payments are settled in cash. At Pranavam Hall at Vennala, a medium-sized auditorium, all the bills have to be settled in cash. The rent will come to Rs. 35,000, and another Rs. 10,000 has to be paid as tax. The setting up of the mandapam and stage decoration will cost Rs. 25,000 and Rs. 5,000 has to be paid for cleaning the hall, all in cash, explained manager K. Hariads. In some cases, cash cheques are accepted towards the booking charges, he said. Nandini Menon, whose daughter is getting married on the first week of December, had planned the events well in advance before the financial crisis hit the market. However, the crisis caught hold of her when she went to collect the wedding dresses from the tailor. “With currency of lesser denominations unavailable, I could not make the payment at the tailoring shop, and took the stitched clothes on credit,” she explained.

664,2016-11-23,16.0,Hoarders ?cash? in on demonetisation,"Black money hoarders in Adilabad seem to be posing an additional problem for bankers, that of weeding out the pre-2005 currency notes from the demonetised Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,000. They are trying to take advantage of the current system and slipping the pre-2005 notes, which were banned by the Reserve Bank of India in 2014, aiming to exchange them for legal tender. The issue has been noticed by bankers here, but nothing much is being done about it as they are under tremendous pressure owing to demonetisation. They are, however, able to weed out such currency thanks to the note counting machines which are programmed to detect the silver thread pieces printed before 2005. The chief cashier at State Bank of Hyderabad, Adilabad main branch, K. Dharmender, singled out one note when an individual came to him to exchange demonetised notes. “This has ceased to be legal tender since long,” he admonished the person on Saturday. A few days earlier, the staff at Andhra Bank in the town found an individual trying to deposit a few Rs. 500 notes which were banned by the Reserve Bank of India in 2014. Some of the staff members took strong objection to it . In another instance which took place four days back, the note counting machine at Indian Bank beeped furiously as it detected pieces of lapsed currency notes in a bundle which was submitted by a seed dealer to be deposited in his account. The dealer, who swore the money was given to him by farmers, ended up poorer by Rs. 4,500 as the machine refused to accept 7 of the Rs. 500 notes and one of the Rs. 1,000 bill as they belonged to the series which were banned two years back and can now be exchanged only at the RBI. According to bankers, the number of older banned notes is much smaller where an individual is concerned, but considerably higher when big business houses or industrialists come into play. Though the old money left with hoarders cannot be quantified at this stage, it is being assumed that they were left with huge stockpiles of the silver thread currency having failed to exchange in the earlier instance, they point out. The cotton market in Adilabad is an ideal place to launder even the older scrapped currency notes as farmers are being paid in Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,000 notes.

665,2016-11-23,16.0,Demonetisation: Udupi Co-ops. Union to approach High Court,"The Udupi District Co-operatives Union on Tuesday decided to approach the High Court of Karnataka on the issue of reduced cash inflow to cooperative societies in the district due to the Union government’s move to demonetise Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,000 notes. Jayakar Shetty Indralli, director of the union, said that all the members of the union had agreed to approach the High Court on this issue as they had exhausted all other options. Earlier, addressing a meeting of the office-bearers of all co-operative societies of the district, Kishan Hegde Kolkebail, president of the Udupi District Co-operatives Union Ltd., said that the co-operative societies were choking due to the Union government’s demonetisation move. The co-operatives union was not against the demonetisation move. But this had reduced the cash inflow at cooperative societies drastically and it had become difficult for them to carry out their day-to-day business. The cash inflow to the societies was just 0.9 per cent. After the government demonetised Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,000 notes on November 8, the union had directed all co-operative societies not to accept these denomination notes for either deposits or loan repayment. With the result, most of the business of the societies had come to a standstill. The constant change of guidelines by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) on acceptance of currency notes had created an atmosphere of confusion. There were 53 agricultural credit co-operative societies and 253 credit co-operative societies in the district with over 3.75 lakh members. Most of the activities of the credit co-operative societies were concentrated in the rural areas. The societies were not able to provide services to the rural people after the demonetisation move. As money in circulation had gone down, loan repayment too was affected. For the last 12 days, it had become difficult for the societies to either provide money from the deposit-holders’ savings accounts. The District Co-operatives Union had approached both the Union and State governments and written several letters to them about the reduced cash inflow, but these attempts had not yielded any fruit. “All co-operative societies have enough funds to repay the depositors and there has been no Income Tax raids on any of the cooperative societies in the district. People should not get taken in by rumours,” Mr. Kolkebail said. S.K. Manjunath, Gopikrishna Rao, Chandrashekhar Shetty and Y. Sudhir Kumar, directors of the union, were present.

Along with this step towards development, they are also compelled to return to their ages old barter system due to dearth of currency notes. Bonda tribals, whose number is around 6,000, live in remote and isolated hilly region in the northwest of Machhkund river. Their remote habitat in Mudulipada and Andrahal panchayats of Khairaput block is called Bonda valley. They have till date tried to preserve their ancient culture and tradition. Demonetisation has also affected lives of Bondas. During past years, efforts of administration and Bonda Development Agency (BDA) have brought in changes related to life and livelihood of these primitive tribals. Bondas had left behind their barter system of transaction and started using currency. According to sources, they store their currency notes, especially the ones of higher denomination, inside small tubular caskets made of bamboo. For their regular needs as well as to sell their forest produce, they travel around 14 kms to reach Khairaput market. They had been using mostly 500 and 1000 rupee notes that they were getting from traders for their cashew produce. After demonetisation, Bonda tribals are facing some problem while making transactions in the Khairaput market. The old 500 and 1000 rupee notes are not accepted in the market. Thus they are now resorting to barter system. They are exchanging their tomatoes for salt or medicinal herbs for biscuit. But along with it, they have also started to stand in queue in front of branches of State Bank of India (SBI) and Utkal Gramin Bank (UGB) at Khairaput to exchange their old currency notes or to get them deposited in their accounts. When contacted, BDS project leader Manga Panna said after the demonetisation process, awareness of banking has increased among Bonda tribals. “They have now realised that banks can be the safest place for savings,” he added. Mr Panna accepted that out of compulsion some Bondas are also resorting to barter system at Khairaput market. According to him link of Bondas will increase further once the proposed branch of SBI comes up at Mudulipada. According to him, a large number of Bonda families have bank accounts. Speaking to The Hindu , Malkangiri Collector, K.Sudarshan Chakravarthy said 83 per cent of populace in the tribal-dominated Malkangiri district have Aadhar cards. It includes the Bonda tribals.

The team headed by N. Sivasailam, Additional Secretary, Union Finance Department, called on Chief Minister Siddaramaiah and Cooperation Minister H.S. Mahadeva Prasad and held discussions on the impact of demonetisation on the State economy, particularly on the functioning of the cooperative sector. Officials of the Cooperation Department briefed the team about the adverse impact of the Centre’s decision on the functioning of cooperative societies, milk unions, sericulture sector, agriculture produce marketing committees (APMCs), and the rural economy. Farmers are unable to repay loans to cooperative banks owing to scrapping of high value currencies, the officials told the team. To get a feel of the ground reality, the team visited DCC Bank, milk cooperatives, and APMCs in Belagavi city and assessed their functioning, sources said. The cooperatives have set a target of disbursing Rs. 1,068 crore to farmers between November, 2016 and January, 2017. Owing to shortage of currencies, cooperatives have not been able to grant or recover loans, officials told the team, sources said. Following widespread drought, farmers have been worst affected by the Centre’s decision, the officials told the team members.

N. Periyasami, district secretary, Thoothukudi South, who led the programme, in Thoothukudi central, said the common people were the worst hit due to the demonetisation exercise as cash was out of reach for them. The demonetisation policy was implemented all of a sudden overnight and people had no alternative but to spend most of their time waiting in front of ATMs and banks to withdraw money and exchange demonetised notes. Many ATMs remained closed and some remained open without cash. Hence, normal life was affected everywhere as people did not have money in their pockets, he said. P. Geetha Jeevan, Thoothukudi MLA and others took part in the human chain. In Tiruchendur, the DMK-men led by MLA Anitha R. Radhakrishnan staged a similar protest opposite Tiruchendur bus stand. In Kovilpatti, the DMK cadres led by A. Subramanian, district secretary, Thoothukudi North, formed a human chain against demonetisation.

| Photo Credit: S_S_KUMAR The Puducherry Pradesh Congress Committee and Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam on Thursday staged demonstrations to condemn the Centre’s decision to demonetise Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,000 currency notes. The PCC organised a demonstration in front of the post office on Thursday to protest the Centre’s decision. They shouted slogans against Prime Minister Narendra Modi for putting public to hardship in the name of fighting corruption. Addressing the protesters, Chief Minister V. Narayanasamy said the decision by the Prime Minister to demonetise higher denomination currency notes would not help in curbing black money. Instead, he said, it would only create hardship to the public and destabilise the economy. People were finding it difficult to meet their daily expenses. Farmers across the country were facing resource crunch to carry out farming. The value of rupee had come down after demonetisation of Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,000 currency notes. Mr. Narayanasamy questioned the Prime Minister’s rationale of not attending the Parliament when the House had taken up for discussion the demonetisation issue. “The Congress is not against any decision to fight black money. But the decision of the Union Government had caused difficulty to the common people and will hurt economic growth. The Congress will continue to raise the inconvenience caused to the public,” he said. The demonetisation issue, he said, would propel the Congress back to power at Centre as the public had realised the folly of electing the BJP to power. Minister for Public Works and PCC president A. Namassivayam said the common man had been largely affected by the Centre’s decision to demonetise high-value currency. The decision was taken without proper planning, he added. Minister for Revenue M.O.H.F. Shahjahan, Minister for Social Works M. Kandasamy, Minister for Electricity R. Kamalakannan, PCC functionaries, and DMK leader S.P Sivakumar participated in the demonstration. Human chain Later, DMK organised a human chain covering most parts of the town. The party cadre shouted slogans against the Prime Minister and the NDA government. Chief Minister and PCC chief also joined the DMK cadres in the human chain. ‘Normality soon’ Meanwhile, a senior official with a private bank said the situation had improved drastically and by month end most of ATMs would be recalibrated. Now, the rush was for depositing money and withdrawal of cash unlike in the beginning when people queued up to exchange notes, he added.

670,2016-11-24,17.0,New Rs. 500 currency notes reach A.P.,"VIJAYAWADA: The long wait for the new Rs. 500 notes has ended with their arrival in the city on Thursday. They will be available in towns and rural areas by the end of this week. The banks will dispatch them to branches depending upon the demand. “We are trying to send them to selected chests and branches in the State,” said a senior official of a public sector bank. The Reserve Bank dispatched a mere Rs. 25 crore worth Rs. 500 notes to Andhra Pradesh. The Andhra Bank, SBI, Bank of Baroda (BOB) and the Syndicate Bank etc received Rs. 1.5 crore each. There are no signs of receiving further dispatches before Monday. The bankers are expecting another Rs. 28 crore by Tuesday, said an official. Chief Minister N. Chandrababu Naidu urged the Centre to dispatch Rs. 1000 crore worth smaller denomination notes such as Rs. 100, Rs. 50, Rs. 20 and Rs.10. The government expected that the RBI would dispatch at least Rs. 50 crore worth Rs. 500 notes initially. Joy of Rs. 500 note Meanwhile, the arrival of Rs 500 notes has sent the excitement levels soaring among Vijayawada people. The excitement, however, vanished into thin air within no time as the ATMs had run out of the notes. Only those customers who could make it to the ATMs as soon as replenishment could garner a few notes. The notes are expected to help streamline the market following the demonetisation of the old high-value notes. The smaller denomination notes in circulation in the State are not sufficient hampering the economic activity as people do not have cash to purchase things. Many are also not willing to take Rs. 2000 notes in view of the shortage of the smaller denomination notes. The situation may ease a little only if there are further dispatches. “The banks have been managing with all the resources they have had these days,” said a banker.

After withdrawing about 80 per cent of the currencies in circulation, the Centre failed to bring in new currencies and ease the situation, they said. The new 2000 rupee note was of no use to the public as they could not get change, they said.

672,2016-11-24,17.0,Tax on post-demonetisation deposits?,"With grocers and cold storage owners refusing to accept scrapped currency notes, farmers are struggling to get potato seeds while landless labourers are forced to forgo their food. Prime Minister Narendra Modi in the Rajya Sabha on Thursday.
    The Union Cabinet on Thursday night is believed to have discussed amending laws to levy close to 60 per cent income tax on unaccounted deposits in banks above a threshold post demonetisation of high-denomination currency notes. The move comes amid banks reporting over Rs. 21,000 crore being deposited in zero-balance Jan Dhan accounts in two weeks after the Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,000 notes were banned, which authorities apprehend may be the laundered black money. There was no official briefing on what transpired in the meeting that was called at short notice as Parliament is in session. Traditionally, there could no disclosures outside on any policy decision taken during the sitting of Parliament. Sources said the government was keen to tax all unaccounted money deposited in bank accounts after it allowed the banned currency to be deposited in bank accounts during a 50-day window from November 10 to December 30. There have been various statements on behalf of the government ever since the demonetisation scheme was announced on November 8, which has led to fears of the taxman coming down heavily on suspicious deposits that could be made to launder black money. Officials have even talked of a 30 per cent tax plus a 200 per cent penalty on top of a possible prosecution in cases where black money holders took advantage of the 50-day window for depositing the banned currency. Sources said the government plans to bring an amendment to the Income Tax Act during the current winter session of Parliament to levy a tax that will be higher than 45 per cent tax and penalty charged on black money disclosed in the one-time Income Disclosure Scheme that ended on September 30. As for those black money holders who did not utilise the window, they would be charged a higher rate which could be close to 60 per cent that the foreign black money holder had paid in 2015. Sources said the government is keen to root out benami deposits, particularly in Jan Dhan accounts. There was also talk of the government imposing a limit on domestic gold holding, but it is not clear if the proposal was discussed at the Cabinet meeting chaired by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Thursday night. The Cabinet meeting, summoned at a very short notice, comes amid reports of high tax penalty terrifying people from putting their cash savings in the formal banking system. The sources said the government wants all of the Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,000 banknotes to be deposited and not burnt or destroyed for the fear of penal action. The Income Tax Department had previously warned that cash deposits above Rs. 2.5 lakh threshold post demonetisation decision could attract tax plus a 200 per cent penalty in case of income mismatch. It was stated that the department was tracking all cash deposited during the period of November 10 to December 30, 2016, above a threshold of Rs. 2.5 lakh in every account. This had instilled fear in people with reports of the banned currency even being destroyed. The sources added that the government may come out with a deposit scheme or an instrument like bond where the cash savings in the banned notes could be deposited. A 50-day window was given to holders of the old currency to deposit in their bank accounts. But the penal tax provisions were deterring many.

673,2016-11-24,17.0,Bank employees demand availability of sufficient currency,"The State Committee of the Bank Employees’ Federation of India has accused the Union government and the Reserve Bank of India of failing in currency management, which had caused the present liquidity crisis following the demonetisation of high value currency notes on November 8. The federation will launch nation-wide protest action from November 29 against the government decision, said said T.Narendran and S.S. Anil of the federation here in a press release on Thursday. The federation leaders said that it would take at least six months for the currency supply situation to normalise. They felt that there was no justification in not allowing cooperative banks and societies in Kerala to exchange old currency for the new ones. They said that bank employees, who had risen to the occasion posed by the present situation, had not been able to attend to their routine duties such as accepting deposits and disbursing loans over the past fortnight. While the employees were now engaged only in currency exchange, it was evident that there was not enough currency notes for the process. The situation was a setback to the production and service sectors and the GDP growth would slow down on account of the currency shortage, the federation leaders said. The loss of working days will add to the misery of the people in the coming days, they said. The crisis had also plunged bank workers into anxiety. A total of 70 persons, including 11 bank workers, had died during these days. It was an indication of the seriousness of the situation and the government must come forward to compensate the families of those who died, the leaders said.

674,2016-11-24,17.0,From currency chest to landfill,"What happens to the demonetised Rs.500 and Rs.1,000 notes? Where do they go from bank branches, many of which over the last fortnight have seen an incessant rush of people to deposit/exchange the notes? Like in the case of mutilated notes, they too will be shredded. Once cut into small pieces they would be dumped in land fills, according to an RBI spokesperson. The central bank stopped incineration of the notes about 15 years ago, she said. The shreds, sources in the banking industry said, were compressed into briquettes. Sometimes, they are recycled and also used to make souvenirs. RBI, however, seems to be preferring to take the old notes to the dump yards. The shredding would be done at different offices of the RBI in the country, including Hyderabad, that are equipped with currency verification and processing systems (CVPS) . The CVPS at the Mumbai office was inaugurated in February 2003 and then RBI said that 42 such systems had been installed in its various offices to supplement the manual processing of notes. Each CVPS is capable of handling 50,000 - 60,000 notes per hour, a process that involves counting, examining their genuineness and sorting them into fit and unfit notes besides destroying the unfit ones on-line. The system sends the shreds to a separate briquetting system where they are compressed into briquettes of small size. The briquettes can be used as residual fuel in industrial furnaces. They can even be used for land fillings or for making items for use at offices and homes, according to RBI. While inviting bids from manufacturers for supply, installation and commissioning of banknote shredding and briquetting system for its various offices, a list in which Hyderabad figured, the bank said the system should be capable of destroying soiled and cancelled bank notes by shredding/granulating and briquetting process. Their capacity should be between 150 and 175 kg. per hour. “The shredded pieces shall be such that at least 90 per cent shreds by weight shall pass through a sieve of 6 mm and no shredded piece shall be larger than 8 mm,” the tender said.

Abdul Salam of Panoor in Kannur district was nabbed on his arrival from Dubai on Thursday around 9 a.m. Addressing a press conference, Customs Commissioner K.N. Raghavan said that the undeclared money had become worthless abroad owing to the demonetisation. The arrested person was only a carrier who had reportedly agreed to do the job for a commission of Rs. 20,000. He was intercepted by the Air Intelligence officers during the baggage checking. The notes were found concealed in a napkin package, tissue paper boxes and soap powder boxes. There was Rs. 7 lakh in Rs. 1,000 currency bills and Rs. 3 lakh in Rs. 500 bills. Salam had left for Dubai from the Kozhikode airport on November 20. The verification of his passport revealed that he was a frequent traveller to Dubai. Though he had been never caught before, Customs officials suspect that he had been active in smuggling activities. The officials also suspect the role of hawala channels behind the currency smuggling. The arrested person allegedly confessed that he had been asked to carry the consignment and hand it over to a person who would contact him outside the airport. He is learned to have revealed the name of the person who was supposed to receive the consignment. Customs officials said that even though the government had ordered foreign exchange agencies abroad to stop accepting withdrawn currency, it is learnt that some of the agencies are still accepting the notes at a 20 per cent reduced exchange rate. These notes are later sent to India to be exchanged for new bills. “We are interrogating the accused to extract information about other people involved in the activities,” Mr. Raghavan said. Customs has alerted the Reserve Bank of India, Income Tax Department and the Enforcement Directorate about the seizure. Customs has registered a case against Salam for carrying money above the permissible limit. A passenger arriving from abroad should make a declaration at the airport if the amount they possess exceeds Rs. 25,000.

Liquor consumption is more in Srikakulam district with a majority of labourers and villagers have become addicted to alcohol. Many of them spend half of their earnings on liquor. NREGA workers top the list of liquor consumption in the district. Srikakulam town has 14 bars and 29 liquor shops. As many as 232 liquor shops are functioning in 38 mandals of the district. Besides, there are a number of belt shops. Generally, the average sale of liquor per day in the district is Rs. 93 lakh and it has come down to Rs.35 lakh per day in the last one week. In Srikakulam, major shops sell liquor worth around Rs.70,000 lakh per day and it has come down to Rs. 30,000 per day. Similar is the case with bars, the sale of which drops to Rs.40,000 from Rs.75,000. “Though the cash crunch has been causing inconvenience, I am happy in one aspect that my husband could not buy liquor after withdrawal of big notes. He used to spend around Rs.150 per day on alcohol,” says Y. .Ramanamma, a resident of Mandala veedhi here. “We tried in vain to reform my husband by approaching de-addiction Centre in Visakhapatnam. But, demonetisation has its impact,” says L. Suseela, a villager of Pedapadu on the outskirts of Srikakualm town. Several women organisations such as Pragati Sila Mahila Sangham and Kinjarapu Jeevan Seva Foundation are of the view that violence against women would come down if liquor consumption is restricted due to demonetisation.

KPCSA district president V. Kunhikrishnan and secretary K. Narayanan said at a press conference here on Thursday that the banks would move the High Court challenging the currency restrictions on the cooperative banks which they said accounted for 65 per cent of the deposit in the Kannur District Cooperative Bank (DCB). Each of the cooperative banks here had transferred crores of rupees since the demonetisation on November 8, they said adding that the banks in return got only paltry sums, leaving primary cooperative banks in a serious crisis as the Reserve Bank of India is not allowing the DCBs to release cash for them. They said that though the primary cooperative banks had accounts in commercial banks which were accepting demonetised notes for exchange, the cooperative banks were being allowed to withdraw only the maximum weekly permissible limit of Rs.24,000 applicable for individual bank account holders in the commercial banks. Propoganda A propaganda that the cooperative banks were safe havens of black money was also being levelled against sector, they said. Stating that the cooperative banks in the district were functioning as per rules set by the State government, they said that the banks were under the scrutiny of the Cooperative Department. Moreover, the Income Tax Department too was keeping tabs on them for the past seven years, they said. The KPCSA functionaries said that the banks were providing all information regarding their depositors if their deposits totalled more than Rs.10 lakh. As decided at a meeting convened by the Income Tax Chief Commissioner, over the last two years customers’ information was being provided if the their deposits crossed Rs.25 lakh. Though the I-T Department had collected huge amounts from the cooperative banks as tax since 2007-08, the amounts were being refunded now after the High Court order that the cooperative banks were exempted from tax net.

The central bank said in view of the problem of mounting deposits it has decided to revive the Guarantee Scheme wherein banks can deposit the notes directly with the offices of RBI under whose jurisdiction they are located. The notes will remain in the vaults of RBI, under the lock and key of the depositing banks till taken up for examination. “As you (banks) are aware there is a massive accumulation of SBNs at branches of banks and currency chests putting strain on processing capacities and storage facilities. This is slowing down the deposit of accumulated SBNs into chests,” it said through a notification. Under the scheme aimed to decongest the storage facilities at banks, RBI will provide credit to their current accounts maintained with RBI. Thereafter, if any shortage, counterfeit note, mutilated note, is detected during detailed processing at RBI, the value of the same will be recovered from the bank concerned. The old Rs 500 and Rs 1000 have lost their legal tender characteristic from November 9. Holders of the currency have option to exchange them with new ones or deposit in bank accounts.

679,2016-11-24,17.0,Banana price falls due to demonetisation,"The demonetisation of high value denomination notes has hit banana growers and traders. Prices of the fruit have fallen sharply as farmers seek to sell their produce quickly. However, arrival of bananas continue to remain high at the wholesale market at Gandhi Market as the fruit cannot be stocked for long. Occurrence of mist in parts of the district, especially in Musiri, Thottiyam and Namakkal areas, has hastened the harvest as the fruit would ripen quickly. A. Vijayendran who has been trading in banana for the past four decades, says that ‘poovan’ and ‘rasthali’ are usually the main arrivals during November and December. Arrivals continue to remain high and normally, the market receives about 8,000 bunches a day. “On Wednesday, I received 500 bunches and on Thursday the arrivals doubled. This has caused a dip in price and a bunch of banana was being sold at about Rs.100 against the normal price of Rs.240 to Rs. 300,” he said. Farmers also wanted immediate cash in denominations of Rs. 100 and not Rs. 500 or Rs. 1,000 in the wake of demonetisation, he said. Another dealer, V. Muniappan, said that being a perishable produce, both farmers and wholesale dealers have been seeking to sell their stocks quickly to raise cash ever since the demonetisation. “Shortage of currency notes of lower denomination has created problems in completing the transactions,” he added. Traders said that though banana prices tend to dip during the monsoon period, the demonetisation has caused a further fall as farmers are looking to sell the fruits which ripen quickly.

  Former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh termed in the Rajya Sabha on Thursday the demonetisation of Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,000 notes an “organised loot and legalised plunder.” Dr. Singh said that while he didn’t disagree with the objective of the government, a “monumental mismanagement has taken place.” “Even supporters speak of the long run. Those who say demonetisation is good in the long run, should recall the quote: ‘In the long run, we are all dead’,” he said during the discussion on demonetisation, . “I would like to ask the Prime Minister for examples of countries where people have deposited their money in banks and not allowed to withdraw their own money,” he observed. The GDP could decline by three per cent. The scheme will hurt small industries. “It is no good that on each day banks bring out new notifications. It doesn’t reflect properly on the PMO, Finance Ministry and the RBI,” he remarked. Dr. Singh said he “sincerely hopes the Prime Minister will find practical , pragmatic ways to relieve the suffering of the people.” Printable version | Jan 7, 2017 1:31:52 AM | http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/Demonetisation-is-an-organised-loot-Manmohan-Singh/article16693025.ece © The Hindu Be it nature’s fury or man’s folly, destructions are alike.

Party chief M. Karunanidhi said ‘opposition leaders’ — the Left parties — had decided to hold countrywide protests against the ruling BJP on the issue and that DMK will protest outside central government offices in Tamil Nadu. “As far as DMK is concerned, massive protest demonstrations will be held outside central government offices in all the districts with the cooperation of the people,” he said in a statement. He urged good participation by party workers and asked them to voice support against this “anti-people” move of the Centre. Mr. Karunanidhi also lashed out at the Centre, saying the common man was severely suffering. He criticised Union Minister M.

684,2016-11-24,17.0,Taxpayers? minds flooded with worries after demonetisation,"Will I be taxed for depositing Rs.2.5 lakh in my account? Will I be caught by the Income Tax Department for depositing Rs.10 lakh now? Will I be prosecuted and imprisoned if I deposit the voided cash in another account? Such queries are being asked by ordinary tax payers since the Centre demonetised Rs.500 and Rs.1,000 notes a fortnight ago. Tax consultants are now facing a daunting task of explaining the nuances of the Income Tax Act to them. “I used to get at least 10 to 15 calls daily in the first week. Some frantically visited my office. Many are doubtful even if they have legal money in their possession,” M. Dileep, a chartered account and tax practitioner, said People can deposit a sum of Rs.2.5 lakh in their zero-balance account by proving the source of income. “Similarly, an individual having an account can deposit cash above Rs.10 lakh if it is legal. He has the option to pay advance tax before March 15 and he can declare such deposits in the Income Tax return,” he added. However, Mr. Dileep said that a person would be liable to pay 200 per cent income tax if a penalty was imposed under Section 270 of the Income Tax Act for not specifying the source of income. The issue would be different for cases of under-reporting and misreporting of income, he added. Huge deposits A. Sasidharan Nair, former senior manager with the Federal Bank, said huge cash deposits of individuals in scheduled commercial banks were being scrutinised by several agencies including the Finance Intelligence Unit under the Department of Revenue, Union Ministry of Finance. “Suspicious transactions have to be reported under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act. Banks and financial institutions should furnish the details of all cash transactions above Rs.10 lakh or its equivalent in foreign currency within a month. This will help in timely dissemination of intelligence on money laundering, terrorist financing, corporate frauds, organised crime, fake currency and tax evasion,” he said. The Income Tax Department has also devised ways to check all accounts of banks functioning under the control of the Reserve Bank of India. “If the sources of income are not shown, a person who deposits unaccounted money in the account of another will be considered a violator under the Benami Transactions (Prohibition) Act for which the penalty is a jail term of maximum of seven years,” an I-T official said.

  The Opposition parties may have closed ranks in Parliament against demonetisation, but in Bihar the ruling grand alliance members are singing different tunes. In a surprise move, Chief Minister and Janata Dal (United) leader Nitish Kumar, has extended full support to the decision, while his alliance partners, the Congress and the Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD), have opposed it vehemently. This has cast doubts on the strength of the alliance. “Ours is a national party and we’re in the grand alliance government following decisions taken by our high command…if our leadership asks us to part ways with the State government, we’ll do it at once…we’re only committed to the Congress”, State Congress president Ashok Chaudhary said on Wednesday, while leading a protest march here. Asked why the JD(U) was supporting the Central government’s decision, Mr. Chaudhary said: “Every political party has got the right to take its own decision on the issue…we’re with the decision of our high command and don’t care who says what.” Similarly, a few days back, Raghuvansh Prasad Singh, senior leader of the RJD, the major partner in the ruling alliance, said that Mr. Kumar’s decision to support the demonetisation decision has “certainly cast a doubt on the unity of the grand alliance”. “People are wondering whether he [Nitish Kumar] still has a soft corner for the BJP with whom he was earlier in alliance… but, we have been saying that the grand alliance is one and strong,” Mr. Singh told journalists. However, reacting to Mr. Chaudhary’s strong statement, RJD leader and deputy Chief Minister Tejaswi Yadav said, “no such statement has come from the party’s central leadership…otherwise all political parties are free to have their own opinion on the issue…the statement does not have any effect on the grand alliance.” JD(U) national general secretary K.C. Tyagi also took a similar stand.   Printable version | Jan 7, 2017 1:32:03 AM | http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/Demonetisation-divides-Bihar-alliance/article16690629.ece © The Hindu Sita Sahani offers a snapshot of life in the time of note bans and smartphones"

| Photo Credit: 
— Photo: M. Srinath The teams of officials despatched by the Centre to make a first-hand assessment of the ground reality post demonetisation met a cross-section of people across the State on Wednesday. One of the Central teams visited various villages in Tiruchi and Perambalur districts and listened to the grievances of farmers and traders. The team members also visited a few Primary Agricultural Cooperative Credit Societies (PACCS) in Tiruchi district and interacted with the farmers and account holders. Praveen Kumar, Joint Secretary, Ministry of Human Resource and Development, gave a patient hearing to the farmers of Irungalur in Tiruchi district as they narrated the ordeal they have been forced to undergo due to the demonetisation. Almost all of them highlighted the undue delay in distribution of crop loans to the farmers. “Demonetisation has almost crippled the agricultural operations in villages. We totally depend upon co-operative societies for farm activities. Almost 15 days have passed since I applied for a crop loan of Rs. 75,000. However, officials refuse to entertain it citing a cash crunch,” said J. Sesuraj, a farmer. “The co-operative society has transacted no business for the past one week. It is open only today. I am not able to withdraw money,” said R. Perumal, an account holder of the society at Irungalur. R. Saveriyar (73), who has deposited about Rs. 7 lakh in the same society, told Mr. Kumar that he was badly in need of at least Rs. 25,000 for undergoing an eye surgery. But, he could not withdraw it in spite of repeated attempts, as society officials had told him that there was no cash flow. Another farmer L. Robert Benjamin of Irungalur told Mr. Kumar that just 15 days were left for conducting the house-warming ceremony for his newly built house. “I need at least Rs. 50,000 for the function. But, I have withdrawn just Rs. 6,000 in the last three days. It is agonising,” he said. Impact on SMEs In Coimbatore, Union Urban Development deputy secretary M. Janaki had an interaction with the representatives of industries, farmers, milk producers and bankers for nearly 90 minutes. The small and medium-scale enterprises are dependent on the micro units to do job works. After demonetisation, these units are unable to pay wages. They do not have cash for day-to-day industrial activities. If the units are unable to supply components, the entire production chain will be hit. If the situation continues for another one week, industrial activity will be completely hit, MSME representatives warned. Vanitha Mohan, president, Indian Chamber of Commerce and Industry, Coimbatore, said the cash crunch only seemed to be getting worse. “There is no point in giving Rs. 2,000 notes, as no one is able to use it. We need smaller denomination notes and they seem to be in short supply.” Southern India Mills’ Association chairman M. Senthil Kumar said the textile industry was hit on the retail and raw material fronts. “Cotton farmers are not bringing cotton to the market as they are unable to get cash payment for their produce. Winter sale is completely affected for the retailers. This has hurt the entire production continuum impacting the livelihood of thousands of people across the value chain,” he said. Bankers said they were handling just about 10 per cent of the normal cash transaction. In Tirupur, officials briefed the team of the cash position in banks and explained the steps taken to calibrate the ATMs to dispense the new Rs. 2,000 and Rs. 500 notes. Mr. Kumar told The Hindu that the teams would submit a report to the Centre based on ground-level inputs on Friday. (With inputs from R.

R. Viswanathan, Secretary of CPI, said the Centre had failed to curb black money as it continued to exist in foreign banks, as investments in gold and stock exchanges. ‘Common man worst hit’ The sudden withdrawal of Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,000 notes had inconvenienced the people. The common man, especially daily wage workers, small vendors, and retail traders had been severely affected and are unable to buy medicines and other essential commodities to meet their daily requirements. The rural economy had been badly hit because of the move since farmers had not been able to purchase seeds and fertilisers. Mr. Viswanathan demanded that the public be allowed to make transactions using the old notes to meet their daily expenses until alternative arrangements were put in place. The party called for increasing the daily withdrawal limit and ensuring sufficient supply of currency notes in all ATMs. The CPI will stage demonstrations in front of banks at 11 centres, including Ariyankuppam, Muthialpet, Lawspet, Villianur, and Bahour protesting against the demonetisation move.

The agitators, who took out the procession from the District Congress Office and staged the dharna outside the Deputy Commissioner’s office, raised slogans against the Union government and Prime Minister Narendra Modi for introducing demonetisation without giving sufficient time to the people. Though the Union government has taken steps to curb illegal activities, including terrorism, the move has caused severe inconvenience to poor farmers and the common man as the government demonetised these notes without any planning and a systematic approach. The poor farmers and the common man are facing severe inconvenience, especially in the rural areas of the district. ‘No bank accounts’ “The poor farm women and the people had saved their hard earned money for several years, since they have no bank accounts or banking facility in the rural areas. After demonetisation, nobody is ready to give change to these people,” they said. The agitators demanded that the Union government should withdraw the order on demonetisation and ensure that the poor farmers and the common man are not put to inconvenience. The agitation was led by District Congress Committee president Fathya Rajan and Zilla Panchayat president Soubhagya Basavarajan.

Accusing Prime Minister Narendra Modi of putting the common man into hardships by banning ₹ 500 and ₹ 1,000 notes, Mr. Jayasuryaprakash Reddy alleged that the elite managed to exchange the banned notes and get the new ₹ 2,000 notes and change they required. The upper limit of ₹ 2.50 lakh on tax less deposits should be relaxed to ₹ 5 lakh or ₹ 10 lakh for the convenience of the middle classes, farmers and parents saving money for their children’s marriage, he said. The former Minister interacted with Andhra Bank Assistant Manager Krishna Rao about the plight of the depositors and the latter replied that the bank received ₹ 100 notes. Showing a bundle of ₹ 100 notes to Mr. Reddy, he said the notes were being given to the account holders and those exchanging the banned notes. He also interacted with depositors in the bank.

691,2016-11-24,17.0,Demonetisation has put brakes on public transportation too,"The Tamil Nadu State Transport Corporation has witnessed a dip in revenue since demonetisation. A scene at the New Bus Stand in Vellore.   The effects of demonetisation are felt in the public transport system too. The number of persons travelling by buses has dropped, giving a tough time for transport officials, who are now witnessing a fall in revenue. An official of the Vellore region of Tamil Nadu State Transport Corporation (TNSTC) (Villupuram) Limited said that the revenue has gone down by at least 15 per cent. TNSTC, Vellore, operates 745 buses, including town buses. These buses ply to places including Chennai, Salem, Tiruchi, Villupuram and Bengaluru. “We are now facing a reduction in collection. Our daily earning, on an average, is around Rs. 70 lakh. There is a decline of about 15 per cent in revenue since demonetisation was announced,” the official said. Another official said the withdrawal of the two high denomination notes of Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,000 has hit markets and businesses. “Likewise, it has affected public transport too. People either do not have sufficient money or lack lower denomination currencies. If they give Rs. 2,000 for a Rs. 100 ticket fare, where will our conductors go for change?” he asked. A crew member of TNSTC also said the number of commuters has come down in the last two weeks. “Some of them pay using the old Rs. 500 note but conductors do not have change,” he added. Private buses too face a similar problem. D. Vijaya Govindarajan, president of Vellore District Bus Owners Association, said passenger flow was low, resulting in dull days for private buses. There are nearly 300 buses that ply to various places within the district and neighbouring districts of Kancheepuram and Tiruvannamalai. “Public movement is low since demonetisation was declared. So, passenger flow has reduced by 20 to 25 per cent. Our revenue has also dropped by 20 to 25 per cent,” he said.

692,2016-11-24,17.0,Justice for all (who have new currency),"Mumbai: At the Mumbai region’s smaller courts, where ordinary citizens go to resolve disputes, seek justice, or answer to the law, the government’s decision to ban high denomination notes has hurt the lower rungs of the system. The courts require a lot of paperwork. Forms must be bought and filled out, stamp paper must be bought, affidavits must be typed out in prescribed formats, documents must be notarised to make them legal. This means multiple small payments to the courts themselves, and to the clusters of support service providers that tend to flourish near them. These payments are not large, and they have usually been made in cash. Demonetisation has meant inconvenience at best, and genuine hardship for many. The High Court has ordered the lower courts to not accept any payments in the now-banned notes. “Work is going smoothly and we are not facing difficulties,” says S.P. Patange, Registrar, City Civil Court. “Although we are not accepting old currency notes, we do [accept payments] through e-payment.” She said that those who were unable to get hold of the new notes were using e-payments or simply postponing their work. A clerk at the family court said that traffic was lower, “but we can still manage the payments somehow. There is not much decrease in the number of clients, but the payment has become an issue”. An advocate at the Metropolitan Magistrate’s court, Borivali, explains, “Generally the amount of fine is Rs. 5,000 or around that. While paying in cash, Rs. 4,000 can be paid in new 2,000-rupee notes, but the rest of the amount is where the difficulty arises. Clients do not pay us on time and consequently, we are unable to deposit the same with the court.” “Business is affected since November 9,” says the owner of Lucky Xerox, near the Civil Court. “The major mode of payment is cash and people do not have enough to make the necessary payment. The invoice is generally for a minimal amount, and even if it is for a higher one, to get change for Rs. 2,000 becomes difficult.” The owner of Simla Stationery, near the Sessions Court, Kala Ghoda, says while there was still a lot of business, “if there were 100 clients before the notification, it has come down to 70”. He has even been turning away regular customers. “To get the notary done, and for the stamps, the amount has to be paid in cash. If they do not have cash, we do not provide them with the service.” Stamp paper, which carries images of the old Rs. 500 note (and higher denominations), has not been affected, vendors say with an air of relief. “But we are providing these only when paid for in the new currency,” a government-authorised stamp vendor in the Kala Ghoda area, who asked not be named, said. “It is a good initiative and we are supportive of this, but the price we are paying is too high,” says Pooja Ghorpade, an advocate. “There are several problems associated with the payment and collection of fees. The payment may be done in cheques, but that too is a tedious process as we do not have much time to deposit them. And at times, a cheque may bounce.” A criminal advocate, who asked not to be named, said, “The payment of surety is also difficult, and clients have to spend more time than required behind bars.” The number of clients approaching the lawyers remained unaffected, she said, “but the money is not.” Crime carries on, in other words, but the legal system is struggling to cope.

693,2016-11-24,17.0,Demonetisation: Revenue collection hit in Yadgir,"The sub-registrar office in Yadgir wore a deserted look on Wednesday.
  Land deals have come down significantly in Yadgir district after the demonetisation of high denomination currency. Sub-registrar offices, which used to be surrounded by crowds till November first week for registration of land deals and other transactions, are almost deserted now. Officials are doubtful about reaching even 25 per cent of the target set for the month for revenue collection from registrations. Of the Rs. 2.05 crore target set for the district, only Rs. 76.14 lakh has been collected till November 22. As many as 240 documents were registered between November 2 and 8 and 131 between November 9 and 22 at the sub-registrar office in Yadgir, Praveen Kumar Gogi, Senior Sub-Registrar, said on Wednesday. “The target for us for the month was Rs. 71 lakh, but just Rs. 37. 22 lakh has been collected so far,” he added. The situation is almost similar in other sub-registrar offices too. As many as 137 documents were registered between November 2 and 8 and 111 between November 9 and 22 at the Shahpur sub-registrar office, Mallesh Kobalkar, Sub-Registrar, said. Of the target of Rs. 78 lakh, Rs 25. 84 lakh had been collected so far. In Surpur, 85 documents were registered between November 2 and 8 and 43 between November 9 and 22, K.C. Chawan, Sub-Registrar, said. He said that though the target was Rs. 36 lakh, only Rs. 8.57 lakh had been collected. As many as 62 documents were registered between November 2 and 8 and 18 between November 9 and 22 at the Hunsagi sub-registrar office, sources said. The target was Rs. 20 lakh and Rs. 4.51 lakh had been collected so far, they added. According to the sources, revenue collection was favourable in October. A sum of Rs. 79.49 lakh was collected in Yadgir, Rs. 38.05 lakh in Shahpur; Rs. 28.73 lakh in Surpur; and Rs. 12.73 lakh in Hunsagi. Mortgage of properties, registration of sale deed, cancellation of agreements, deed of will, trust deed and other modes of registration were recorded in October. However, registration for properties was less this month owing to cash crunch. “We can’t do anything in such circumstances except to wait for another couple of weeks,” one of the village residents, whose land was kept for sale and put off owing to cash crunch, told The Hindu. Another farmer from Jalibenchi village in Surpur taluk said he would postpone the negotiations for selling his four acres.

| Photo Credit: Atish Pomburfekar PANAJI: Rubbishing the claim of the Union government that terrorist activities have been hit hard by the demonetisation move, the All India Congress Committee (AICC) general secretary Digvijaya Singh said here on Wednesday that the terrorists use digital currency like Bitcoin (currency largely used with ease to conduct unregulated transactions, across international borders) and demonetisation will hardly have any effect on terror activities. The Senior Congress leader in-charge of Goa blamed Prime Minister Narendra Modi for putting poor Indians to hardship through an ill-implemented demonetisation. “Most of the drug peddling and terror activities and illegal activities are now done through Bitcoin. It is dealt through different software and it is impossible to trace. Can the Prime Minister, government of India and particularly the NSA be so naive as to believe that terrorism can be eradicated by simply demonetisation,” Mr. Singh asked sarcastically at a press conference here during his visit to review the party’s preparedness for the Assembly elections next year. Mr. Singh further said that the decision to demonetise currency would not impact terror activities at all, as is proved by the recent cash seizureby the army from a slain terrorist in Bandipore district in Jammu and Kashmir. “New currency notes have been found in possession of certain terrorists in Kashmir Valley. Where did they get the currency notes from when common people are not getting these currency notes?” asked Mr. Singh. Mr. Singh said that the party did not oppose demonetisation per se but was disappointed to see that BJP simply did not know how to govern and showed total lack of understanding about what kind of miseries it will inflict on common people by changing nearly 86 per cent of the currency notes in a currency-based economy like India. He also lamented that because of thoughtless implementation of the scheme by the Central government, as many as 70 people lost their life out of shock and pain of standing in queues before banks for hours despite having money in bank but unable to spend it. “All this could have been avoided,” said Mr. Singh. The government, he added, should have been aware that black money is primarily generated by non-payment of taxes and that cannot be eradicated by simply demonetising currency. Mr. Singh also attacked the Goa BJP and the Union Defence Minister Manohar Parrikar and accused them of striking deals with builders by introducing piece-meal changes in building rules favouring some builders."

Mandya, the largest milk producing district in the State, has 1,170 milk producers’ cooperative societies. Of this, around 50 per cent are all-women cooperative milk producers’ societies. As many as 1.12 lakh farmers supply at least 7.5 lakh litres a day to the Mandya Milk Manufacturers’ Union Ltd. (MANMUL). On an average, each farmer supplies seven litres of milk a day to MANMUL through societies spread across the district. They are paid Rs. 27.30 for one litre (including the incentive of Rs. 4 and 80 paise for the society maintaining charges). Nevertheless, according to the suppliers, the ban of the two high-value currency has destabilised the financial activities of the societies. The demonetisation move has severely hit the milk producers since November 9, says Kadaluru Ramakrishna, chairman, the Mandya Milk Manufacturers’ Union Ltd.. Cash crunch According to milk suppliers, the currency crisis has been forcing them to collect payment once in 10 or 15 days owing to shortage of smaller denomination notes. Mandya is the largest milk producing district (in terms of district-wise milk production) in the State with a production of 7.5 lakh to 8 lakh litres a day. While the Kolar Milk Union collects around 7 lakh litres from farmers in Kolar and Chickballapur districts, Mysuru Milk union procures around 6.10 lakh litres from farmers in Mysuru and Chamarajanagar districts. Around 50 per cent of suppliers are women and majority of the suppliers are from poor economic background.

696,2016-11-24,17.0,Demonetisation decision taken in haste: Congress,"The activists of the Shivamogga District Congress Committee (SDCC) staged a protest here on Wednesday over what it called the problems faced by the public following the announcement to demonetise Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,000 notes. Addressing the protest meet, T.N. Srinivas, SDCC president, said that the BJP-led National Democratic Alliance Government at the Centre made the demonetisation move without making proper preparation to face its consequences. Normal life has been badly disturbed owing to demonetisation and long queues at the banks for exchange of demonetised currency with new notes has become a common sight. Owing to restrictions imposed on withdrawal of cash, the farmers are finding it difficult to arrange for money to pay wage to the labourers hired for harvest work. The traders are also deferring the purchase of agricultural produces from the farmers owing to cash crunch. This has resulted in decline in the prices of agricultural produce, he said. The delay in recalibration of ATM kiosks for the new currency has aggravated the problem, he said, adding that it was unfortunate that the Union government has implemented the demonetisation in haste resulting in hardship for the common people. SDCC functionaries Rame Gowda, Vijayalakshmi Patil, and Ramesh Ikkeri were present on the occasion.

Will I be caught by the Income Tax Department for depositing Rs.10 lakh now? Will I be prosecuted and imprisoned if I deposit the voided cash in another account? Such queries are being asked by ordinary tax payers since the Centre demonetised Rs.500 and Rs.1,000 notes a fortnight ago. Tax consultants are now facing a daunting task of explaining the nuances of the Income Tax Act to them. “I used to get at least 10 to 15 calls daily in the first week. Some frantically visited my office. Many are doubtful even if they have legal money in their possession,” M. Dileep, a chartered account and tax practitioner, said People can deposit a sum of Rs.2.5 lakh in their zero-balance account by proving the source of income. “Similarly, an individual having an account can deposit cash above Rs.10 lakh if it is legal. He has the option to pay advance tax before March 15 and he can declare such deposits in the Income Tax return,” he added. Huge deposits However, Mr. Dileep said a person would be liable to pay 200 per cent income tax if a penalty was imposed under Section 270 of the IT Act for not specifying the source of income. The issue would be different for cases of under-reporting and misreporting of income, he added. A. Sasidharan Nair, former senior manager with the Federal Bank, said huge cash deposits of individuals in scheduled commercial banks were being scrutinised by several agencies including the Finance Intelligence Unit under the Department of Revenue, Union Ministry of Finance. “Suspicious transactions have to be reported under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act. Banks and financial institutions should furnish the details of all cash transactions above Rs.10 lakh or its equivalent in foreign currency within a month. This will help in timely dissemination of intelligence on money laundering, terrorist financing, corporate frauds, organised crime, and tax evasion,” he said. The Income Tax Department has also devised ways to check all accounts of banks functioning under the control of the Reserve Bank of India. “If the sources of income are not shown, a person who deposit unaccounted money in the account of another will be considered a violator under the Benami Transactions ( Prohibition) Act,” an I-T official said.

The court also asked the petitioner to produce the bylaws of the cooperative society. The petition was filed by N.K. Joseph, president of the Kallettumkara Service Cooperative Bank in Thrissur. The RBI had excluded the primary cooperative banks from the list of banks empowered to receive demonetised notes and replace them. In fact, the State cooperative banks were allowed to undertake such transactions. The petitioner’s bank, therefore, was equally entitled to do the business, the petitioner contended.

R. Viswanathan, Secretary of CPI, said the Centre had failed to curb black money as it continued to exist in foreign banks, as investments in gold and stock exchanges. ‘Common man worst hit’ The sudden withdrawal of Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,000 notes had inconvenienced the people. The common man, especially daily wage workers, small vendors, and retail traders had been severely affected and are unable to buy medicines and other essential commodities to meet their daily requirements. The rural economy had been badly hit because of the move since farmers had not been able to purchase seeds and fertilisers. Mr. Viswanathan demanded that the public be allowed to make transactions using the old notes to meet their daily expenses until alternative arrangements were put in place. The party called for increasing the daily withdrawal limit and ensuring sufficient supply of currency notes in all ATMs. The CPI will stage demonstrations in front of banks at 11 centres, including Ariyankuppam, Muthialpet, Lawspet, Villianur, and Bahour protesting against the demonetisation move.

Accusing Prime Minister Narendra Modi of putting the common man into hardships by banning Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,000 notes, Mr. Jayasuryaprakash Reddy alleged that the elite managed to exchange the banned notes and get the new Rs. 2,000 notes and change they required. The upper limit of Rs. 2.50 lakh on tax less deposits should be relaxed to Rs. 5 lakh or Rs. 10 lakh for the convenience of the middle classes, farmers and parents saving money for their children’s marriage, he said. The former Minister interacted with Andhra Bank Assistant Manager Krishna Rao about the plight of the depositors and the latter replied that the bank received Rs. 100 notes. Showing a bundle of Rs. 100 notes to Mr. Reddy, he said the notes were being given to the account holders and those exchanging the banned notes. He also interacted with depositors in the bank.

Though the Union government has taken steps to curb illegal activities, including terrorism, the move has caused severe inconvenience to poor farmers and the common man as the government demonetised these notes without any planning and a systematic approach. The poor farmers and the common man are facing severe inconvenience, especially in the rural areas of the district. ‘No bank accounts’ “The poor farm women and the people had saved their hard earned money for several years, since they have no bank accounts or banking facility in the rural areas. After demonetisation, nobody is ready to give change to these people,” they said.

Subramanyam, a senior IAS officer and an additional secretary in the Union government, was flooded with complaints about the problems being faced by public due to non-availability of low denomination notes and restrictions imposed on withdrawal of cash from the banks following demonetisation in the district. Mr Subramanyam was assigned to study the problems by the people due to demonetisation of Rs. 1,000 and Rs. 500 notes. He interacted with a cross-section of people including farmers, womenfolk, RTC passengers, small-time traders, vegetable vendors and others in Gundlapalli village in Ganneruvaram mandal, Manakondur mandal and Karimnagar. At Gandlapalli village, Mr Subramanyam visited the State Bank of India branch and inquired about the problems being faced by customers. A farmer suggested that the government should give instructions to banks to allow account holders to withdraw money without any restrictions. He said the release of only Rs. 2,000 notes was causing several hardships in getting change to provide wages to labourers. Enkavva, another customer, said that she had deposited an amount in the bank to meet the hospital expenses for the delivery of her daughter in a private hospital. But the bank was providing only Rs. 24,000 per week. She urged the authorities to provide the required amount at a time. At Gattu Duddenapalli cooperative bank, the farmers found fault with the RBI for not allowing them to deposit and exchange Rs. 1,000 and Rs. 500 notes in cooperative banks. The farmers also said that the issuance of only Rs. 2,000 notes into the market was causing hardships in getting change and urged the government to release Rs. 500 notes immediately. Welcoming the government’s decision, denizens of Karimnagar complained about restrictions in the withdrawal of only Rs 2,000 per day from ATM a and subsequent problem with the non-availability of change. They said that the problems would be solved if the government releases Rs. 500 notes. The hoteliers said that the business was affected due to non-availability of change.

704,2016-11-24,17.0,Impact of demonetisation hits milk producers too,"Milk producers across Mysuru district have not been spared from the impact of demonetisation. The cooperative milk producers’ societies had been finding it difficult to pay producers once a week or 10 days upon getting payment to their respective bank accounts from the Mysore Milk Union owing to the ceiling fixed on cash withdrawal. Since the withdrawal limit a week had been fixed at Rs. 24,000, the societies have been unable to withdraw sufficient cash to pay milk producers registered under it. The producers’ are either given part payment or their consent taken to transfer money to their accounts if they don’t need the money immediately. Though almost all the milk producers have bank accounts since the government subsidy of Rs. 4 a litre was directly credited to their accounts, the producers mostly prefer cash payments owing to limited banking facility. Sources at the Mysuru Milk Union told The Hindu that the societies had been asked to manage the crisis locally and credit the producers’ payment to their accounts henceforth. “Milk producers have been affected by the cash crisis. Each society gets at least Rs. 1 lakh a week as payment towards milk supply to the union. With the withdrawal limit being Rs. 24,000 a week, it is difficult to make payments to all,” the sources said. About 89,580 milk producers are registered with the Mysuru union, which procures milk from them daily through the milk producers’ cooperative societies. Mysuru district alone has over 950 cooperative milk producers’ societies. The union’s current daily milk procurement stands at 6.5 lakh litres. Production had been affected owing to drought and scarcity of fodder. An officer at the Mysore Milk Union said that around Rs. 7 crore was paid to producers through their respective societies once a week or within 10 days. “By and large, cash transactions had been most preferred by the producers as many are averse to visiting banks for deposits or withdrawals. The currency crisis and restrictions in withdrawal for farmers’ cooperatives are being managed locally,” he said.

FADA president John Paul stated in a press release that the situation of retail sector was much more alarming than the dealer community has anticipated. The entire auto retail trade has come under severe stress. The FADA realised that the situation was transitional and would ultimately normalise and probably be better than now. However, most of the dealerships were saddled with stocks and near zero retail. The situation was unlikely to see much improvement till the end of the financial year, he said. As a consequence, it seems unlikely that a majority of dealerships would be in a position to honour their commitments to banks and financial institutions. To tide over the crisis, Mr. Paul urged the vehicle manufacturers to come up with their support to reduce inventory at the dealerships and to make available enhanced credits from banks to the dealers. The banks should also come forward to increase vehicle and personal loan limits for the customers, including 100 per cent on-road funding for vehicle purchases. The government should take steps to reduce the service charge levied by banks for credit card transactions.

706,2016-11-24,17.0,Demonetisation likely to take the shine off sahitya sammelan,"Demonetisation of currency in the denomination of Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,000 is likely to affect the 82nd Akhila Bharata Kannada Sahitya Sammelan scheduled for the first week of December in Raichur in more than one way. As per well-placed sources closely associated with the literary event, the target of mobilising Rs. 2 crore from local sources cannot be met as the potential donors — businessmen, rice mill owners, traders and alike —themselves are in financial trouble. “Businessmen usually donate in cash as they have huge unaccounted money which is normally in the form of Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,00 notes. With the demonetisation of these high value notes, they are unable to make donations. They are not so generous to donate their accounted money through cheques and electronic transfer. The major source of fund mobilisation has thus dried up with the demonetisation,” an organiser said. Sasikanth S.Senthil, Deputy Commissioner, who looks after the financial matters of the sammelan, is confident of organising the event with the funds provided by the State government. He is of the opinion that the Rs. 4 crore that the government had allocated was a “decent amount” for smooth conduct of the event. Considering demonetisation and resultant crunch in fund mobilisation, he has approached potential donors appealing to them to offer their contributions in the form of goods and services required for the event instead of cash donations. “Hundreds of hotel rooms are booked for providing accommodation to guests. In the normal condition, we would have collected donations and pay for the rooms. Now, upon our request in view of demonetisation, the hotel owners have agreed to provide rooms for free. Other responsibilities and tasks that require money are being entrusted to many people,” Mr. Senthil told The Hindu . Vishnukanth Budadi of Shilpa Medicare Limited and the Raichur Rice Millers Association have similarly agreed to provide food to guests and the people for three days, Mahantesh Maski, former district president of the Kannada Sahitya Parishat said. In order to manage with limited financial resources, the organising committee is planning drop many proposals for cutting the costs. “We will have to use the funds judiciously. We will put money on unavoidable expenditure such as erecting stage and cultural teams. We may have to avoid providing jackets to mediapersons and other such expenditures,” Mr. Senthil said. Using the surplus money after the sammelan, a Kannada Bhavan is normally built for the parishat at the town where sammelan is organised. But this time, the organisers are not sure that they could save some money for purpose.

707,2016-11-24,17.0,Demonetisation has put brakes on public transportation too,"The effects of demonetisation are felt in the public transport system too. The number of persons travelling by buses has dropped, giving a tough time for transport officials, who are now witnessing a fall in revenue. An official of the Vellore region of Tamil Nadu State Transport Corporation (TNSTC) (Villupuram) Limited said that the revenue has gone down by at least 15 per cent. TNSTC, Vellore, operates 745 buses, including town buses. These buses ply to places including Chennai, Salem, Tiruchi, Villupuram and Bengaluru. “We are now facing a reduction in collection. Our daily earning, on an average, is around Rs. 70 lakh. There is a decline of about 15 per cent in revenue since demonetisation was announced,” the official said. Another official said the withdrawal of the two high denomination notes of Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,000 has hit markets and businesses. “Likewise, it has affected public transport too. People either do not have sufficient money or lack lower denomination currencies. If they give Rs. 2,000 for a Rs. 100 ticket fare, where will our conductors go for change?” he asked. A crew member of TNSTC also said the number of commuters has come down in the last two weeks. “Some of them pay using the old Rs. 500 note but conductors do not have change,” he added. Private buses too face a similar problem. D. Vijaya Govindarajan, president of Vellore District Bus Owners Association, said passenger flow was low, resulting in dull days for private buses. There are nearly 300 buses that ply to various places within the district and neighbouring districts of Kancheepuram and Tiruvannamalai. “Public movement is low since demonetisation was declared. So, passenger flow has reduced by 20 to 25 per cent. Our revenue has also dropped by 20 to 25 per cent,” he said.

The team members also visited a few Primary Agricultural Cooperative Credit Societies (PACCS) in Tiruchi district and interacted with the farmers and account holders. Praveen Kumar, Joint Secretary, Ministry of Human Resource and Development, gave a patient hearing to the farmers of Irungalur in Tiruchi district as they narrated the ordeal they have been forced to undergo due to the demonetisation. Almost all of them highlighted the undue delay in distribution of crop loans to the farmers. “Demonetisation has almost crippled the agricultural operations in villages. We totally depend upon co-operative societies for farm activities. Almost 15 days have passed since I applied for a crop loan of Rs. 75,000. However, officials refuse to entertain it citing a cash crunch,” said J. Sesuraj, a farmer. “The co-operative society has transacted no business for the past one week. It is open only today. I am not able to withdraw money,” said R. Perumal, an account holder of the society at Irungalur. R. Saveriyar (73), who has deposited about Rs. 7 lakh in the same society, told Mr. Kumar that he was badly in need of at least Rs. 25,000 for undergoing an eye surgery. But, he could not withdraw it in spite of repeated attempts, as society officials had told him that there was no cash flow. Another farmer L. Robert Benjamin of Irungalur told Mr. Kumar that just 15 days were left for conducting the house-warming ceremony for his newly built house. “I need at least Rs. 50,000 for the function. But, I have withdrawn just Rs. 6,000 in the last three days. It is agonising,” he said. Impact on SMEs In Coimbatore, Union Urban Development deputy secretary M. Janaki had an interaction with the representatives of industries, farmers, milk producers and bankers for nearly 90 minutes. The small and medium-scale enterprises are dependent on the micro units to do job works. After demonetisation, these units are unable to pay wages. They do not have cash for day-to-day industrial activities. If the units are unable to supply components, the entire production chain will be hit. If the situation continues for another one week, industrial activity will be completely hit, MSME representatives warned. Vanitha Mohan, president, Indian Chamber of Commerce and Industry, Coimbatore, said the cash crunch only seemed to be getting worse. “There is no point in giving Rs. 2,000 notes, as no one is able to use it. We need smaller denomination notes and they seem to be in short supply.” Southern India Mills’ Association chairman M. Senthil Kumar said the textile industry was hit on the retail and raw material fronts. “Cotton farmers are not bringing cotton to the market as they are unable to get cash payment for their produce. Winter sale is completely affected for the retailers. This has hurt the entire production continuum impacting the livelihood of thousands of people across the value chain,” he said. Bankers said they were handling just about 10 per cent of the normal cash transaction. In Tirupur, officials briefed the team of the cash position in banks and explained the steps taken to calibrate the ATMs to dispense the new Rs. 2,000 and Rs. 500 notes. Mr. Kumar told The Hindu that the teams would submit a report to the Centre based on ground-level inputs on Friday. ( With inputs from R.

On the sidelines of Sangat Darshan programme in the Lambi Assembly segment here, the Chief Minister, when asked to comment on probability of the former BJP MP joining the the Congress, said Mr. Sidhu was “non-decisive” in joining any party due to his vested interests. Mr. Badal said people who have “no stand” on any issue “are bound to go in political oblivion”. He said people of the State have “strong disliking” for “opportunists and defectors, who backstab their mother party for sake of personal interests”. Replying to another query, the Chief Minister said revolts against Akali Dal were coming from “only those who have been denied tickets by the party”. On another query, the Chief Minister said anyone was free to contest election against anybody. “However, one thing was crystal clear that security deposits of Lok Sabha MP and AAP leader Bhagwant Mann would be forfeited if he contests against Deputy Chief Minister Sukhbir Singh Badal from Jalalabad,” he said. Replying to another query, he said the demonetisation move would prove beneficial for the country. He said November 25 would be an important day for the State as the Prime Minister would lay foundation stone for AIIMS at Bathinda. Mr. Badal said for the “first time since Independence any Centre has given such a big ticket project” to the State. He said the project to come up at a cost of Rs 1,000 crore would transform the healthcare sector in the State.

711,2016-11-24,17.0,Demonetisation impact: Govt. unlikely to waive crop loans,"With demonetisation adversely impacting resource mobilisation, the government is unlikely to write off crop loans borrowed by farmers from the State-run cooperative banks. Sources in the government told The Hindu that farmers had borrowed nearly Rs. 10,000 crore from various cooperatives across the State. Waiver of farm loans would adversely impact the State’s fiscal health and implementation of several subsidy schemes of the government. It is learnt that Chief Minister Siddaramaiah told arty legislators that it would not be economically viable to waive crop loans since the revenue collection is expected to dip by Rs. 15,000 crore in the current fiscal year (2016-17) owing to demonetisation of high denomination currencies. In the post-demonetisation period, there had been a sharp decline in collection of taxes owing to dip in land registration and vehicle registration across the State. The real estate sector, which witnesses a lot of cash payments, had been hit hard by the Centre’s decision to ban high currency, sources said. Moreover, the sources said the State’s committed expenditure, including salary and pensions, had shot up to Rs. 50,000 crore a year. Further, power subsidy bill is expected to touch Rs. 10,000 crore this year. With rising government expenditure, the Chief Minister, who presided the Congress Legislature Party meeting here on Wednesday, told party MLAs and MLCs that it would not be possible to write off crop loans. However, the sources said the government was exploring other options to provide sops to farmers hit hard by severe drought in 139 taluks. The entire Opposition in both the Houses had been demanding waiver of crop loans. Janata Dal (S) leader and former Chief Minister H.D. Kumaraswamy has demanded compensation of Rs. 25,000 per acre to farmers.

712,2016-11-24,17.0,TMC holds protest against demonetisation,": The Tamil Maanila Congress (TMC) on Wednesday protested against the Central government’s implementation of the demonetisation policy. The protest at the Collectorate was presided by TMC president G.K. Vasan. “There is a cash crunch in the country for the first time since Independence,” he said, criticising the Centre for going ahead with the move without sound planning. He also urged it to take immediate steps to ease the situation. “Instead of five percent, who should be the target, now 95 per cent of the people are suffering,” he said. The TMC also demanded that all co-operative banks be given the power to exchange the withdrawn currency. The party also appealed for the extension of the November 24 deadline for using the withdrawn banknotes at various outlets by a month. Mr. Vasan said that his party would organise street-level protests in towns and villages throughout the State on November 26 against demonetisation.

713,2016-11-24,17.0,?Demonetisation will not achieve stated objectives?,"A panel of economists who met at the Madras Institute of Development Studies (MIDS) to discuss the demonetisation policy of the central government said that the stated objectives of the policy will not be fulfilled. “Essentially, collectively, the panellists have made the following points — that....we are certain that the stated intentions of the government will not be served well,” said Venkatesh B. Athreya, summarising the discussion on behalf of his three co-panellists. The session, called Understanding Demonetisation: Issues and Challenges, was held at a packed Adiseshiah Auditorium and moderated by C. Lakshmanan of MIDS. The panellists’ interaction with the audience was disrupted multiple times due to arguments between supporters and critics of the policy. Demand crash “What we are saying is that, there is both — pain now, and absolutely no prospect of realising the intentions in the medium or long run,” said Mr. Athreya. He said that more data was needed before making forecasts about the economy. “We can definitely say that, in the short term, there will be a demand crash, in the medium term, there will be a production scarcity,” he said, warning that inflationary tendencies would result. “The declared objectives may not have been the real objectives — that is the speculation,” said Mr. Athreya, who assigned political motives to the Prime Minister’s announcement. RBI governor’s role “There used to be an institution called the RBI in this country. Its Governor is the most invisible person today,” he said. “All of us have said enough that the moves made by the government lack credibility. We have cast enough doubt on the motives of the government,” said S. Subramanian, formerly with MIDS, who termed the move an unqualified disaster. “Ultimately, what we are guaranteeing is a redistribution of wealth from actual defaulters to a set of either the same defaulters or a set of potential defaulters,” he said. Impact on farmers S. Janakarajan, also with MIDS, said that the policy had affected farmers and its impact would manifest itself in subsequent seasons, leading to food inflation. He said the informal sector would bear the brunt of the move, citing interactions with ragpickers on the East Coast Road over the past fortnight. Jothi Sivaganam, head of the department of economics at the University of Madras, said that the government was resorting to carpet bombing, instead of a surgical strike to target unaccounted wealth. “We are squeezing liquidity because of the government’s constraints in supplying currency,” he said.

714,2016-11-24,17.0,Justice for all (who have new currency),"At the Mumbai region’s smaller courts, where ordinary citizens go to resolve disputes, seek justice, or answer to the law, the government’s decision to ban high denomination notes has hurt the lower rungs of the system. The courts require a lot of paperwork. Forms must be bought and filled out, stamp paper must be bought, affidavits must be typed out in prescribed formats, documents must be notarised to make them legal. This means multiple small payments to the courts themselves, and to the clusters of support service providers that tend to flourish near them. These payments are not large, and they have usually been made in cash. Demonetisation has meant inconvenience at best, and genuine hardship for many. The High Court has ordered the lower courts to not accept any payments in the now-banned notes. “Work is going smoothly and we are not facing difficulties,” says S.P. Patange, Registrar, City Civil Court. “Although we are not accepting old currency notes, we do [accept payments] through e-payment.” She said that those who were unable to get hold of the new notes were using e-payments or simply postponing their work. A clerk at the family court said that traffic was lower, “but we can still manage the payments somehow. There is not much decrease in the number of clients, but the payment has become an issue”. An advocate at the Metropolitan Magistrate’s court, Borivali, explains, “Generally the amount of fine is Rs. 5,000 or around that. While paying in cash, Rs. 4,000 can be paid in new 2,000-rupee notes, but the rest of the amount is where the difficulty arises. Clients do not pay us on time and consequently, we are unable to deposit the same with the court.” “Business is affected since November 9,” says the owner of Lucky Xerox, near the Civil Court. “The major mode of payment is cash and people do not have enough to make the necessary payment. The invoice is generally for a minimal amount, and even if it is for a higher one, to get change for Rs. 2,000 becomes difficult.” The owner of Simla Stationery, near the Sessions Court, Kala Ghoda, says while there was still a lot of business, “if there were 100 clients before the notification, it has come down to 70”. He has even been turning away regular customers. “To get the notary done, and for the stamps, the amount has to be paid in cash. If they do not have cash, we do not provide them with the service.” Stamp paper, which carries images of the old Rs. 500 note (and higher denominations), has not been affected, vendors say with an air of relief. “But we are providing these only when paid for in the new currency,” a government-authorised stamp vendor in the Kala Ghoda area, who asked not be named, said. “It is a good initiative and we are supportive of this, but the price we are paying is too high,” says Pooja Ghorpade, an advocate. “There are several problems associated with the payment and collection of fees. The payment may be done in cheques, but that too is a tedious process as we do not have much time to deposit them. And at times, a cheque may bounce.” A criminal advocate, who asked not to be named, said, “The payment of surety is also difficult, and clients have to spend more time than required behind bars.” The number of clients approaching the lawyers remained unaffected, she said, “but the money is not.” Crime carries on, in other words, but the legal system is struggling to cope.

715,2016-11-24,17.0,"Post-demonetisation, fisheries sector struggling to stay afloat","It’s stinking. To an urban nose, it is even nauseating. The stench of rotten fish mingles with the early morning breeze. Seagulls hover eyeing an easy catch as a gloomy dawn breaks at Beypore, one of Kerala’s major fishing harbours. For hundreds of fish workers at the harbour, for whom the working day begins at 4 a.m., the stench hardly matters. They are sorting the catch that landed ashore last evening; crushing huge blocks of ice for use in freezers on board boats; loading nets, wire-ropes, water canisters, groceries and other essentials onto boats which are roaring to go out into the sea; and, unloading box after box of fish from boats that had returned from the sea after sundown. But, the harbour is half as busy as it was a fortnight ago—before the onset of the currency crisis triggered by demonetisation. Mohammed Razik, a commission agent, is deeply worried. “I don’t know how to pay the ‘boys’ who are helping to unload the fish boxes from the boats,” he tells The Hindu . “They need to be paid in cash on the spot after the work is over,” he says. Razik hardly has any cash in hand. He has money in the bank, but the Rs. 24,000 limit for this week has already been reached. “If I don’t pay them at least a part of their wages, they may not show up for work tomorrow,” he says in anguish. Dozens of commission agents (or Tharakans) like Mr. Razik, who operate at the Beypore fishing harbour and who are an important link in the largely informal fishery economy, are in deep trouble because of the scrapping of the high denomination notes. The Tharakan has been a unique institution in Kerala’s fishery economy for a long time. He is a middle man between the fishermen and the fish buyer and he links the fish to the market. He finances the fishing trips. For his work, the Tharakan gets a commission—ranging from 3 per cent to 5 per cent of the value of the catch. The Tharakan, sometimes dubbed an exploiter, oils the fishery economy with his cash liquidity. Almost the entire operation is in cash. “Without the help of the Tharakans, it is hard to run the fishery business,” says Murali, who is a co-owner of a fishing boat. “The Tharakans take care of all the day-to-day payments,” he says. When the Tharakans’ cash flows dry up, the fishery economy dries up too. The cash-trapped Tharakan is now the symbol of the cash crunch facing the Beypore fishing harbour, which is home to around 450 boats. Because of the crunch, every single person involved in the hundreds of different tasks in fishing — the men who go on the boat, those who break ice blocks, the tea vendor, the lottery agent, the lorry drivers — are all affected badly. “On average, 50 families rely on a single fishing boat for their livelihood,” points out K. Preman, the president of the Beypore Fishing Harbour Development Committee. The lottery vendor rues that the fisherfolk, great believers in the luck factor, now turn their back on seeing him. Nearly three-fourths of the workers on the sea-going boats at Beypore are migrant labour from Eastern India. “The mobile phone is the lifeline for them,” says M. Basheer, president of the Kozhikode district unit of the Fish Merchants and Commission Agents Association. “Now they are unable to pay even for the connection recharge.” Printable version | Jan 7, 2017 1:32:45 AM | http://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kozhikode/Post-demonetisation-fisheries-sector-struggling-to-stay-afloat/article16723389.ece © The Hindu UK couple Marianne Mecklenburg and David Mecklenburg recall their tryst with Kozhikode."

Terming the decision as “unplanned”, R. Viswanathan, secretary of the CPI who led the demonstration in front of Corporation Bank at Indira Gandhi square, said the move had severely affected the common man. He said the Centre had failed to retrieve black money stashed in foreign countries. Instead of taking action against hoarders, the Centre had put common people in trouble. The sudden withdrawal of Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,000 notes had inconvenienced the people. The common man, especially daily wage workers, small vendors, and retail traders, had been severely affected and are unable to buy medicines and other essential commodities to meet their daily requirements, he said.

717,2016-11-25,18.0,Milk producers in HK region feel demonetisation heat,"With district central cooperative banks running short of valid currency caused by demonetisation of currency in the denomination of Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,000, coupled with the government-imposed limit on the amount of transactions in banks, over 41,000 small milk producers across the rural areas of Hyderabad Karnataka region are forced to manage their households without payment for the last two weeks. Though the Karnataka Cooperative Milk Producers’ Federation Ltd (KMF) is making payments to societies online as usual, the milk societies that procure milk at village level are unable to make weekly payments to milk suppliers. Kalaburagi Milk Union, under which Bidar, Kalaburagi and Yadgir districts fall, procures around 57,000 litres of milk a day from around 10,700 farmers and makes payments to milk suppliers on weekly basis. However, it could not make payments — about Rs. 1 crore a week — farmers for the last two weeks. “As per the Union government, a person or cooperative society can draw maximum of Rs. 24,000 a week. It is insufficient to make payments to all milk suppliers. The milk societies have therefore stopped payments to farmers for the last two weeks. I have been receiving a number of calls on the payment-related grievances and rushing to those places for redressing them,” Manohar Kulkarni, deputy manager, Kalaburagi Milk Union, told The Hindu on Friday. DCC bank officials were saying that the issue of currency shortage would hopefully be resolved by Monday, he said. Some milk societies that had adopted online mode of payment to their suppliers well before the demonetisation are at ease. But their number is too small. As per the information provided by KMF officials, of 355 functional milk cooperative societies under Kalaburagi Milk Union, only 15 have adopted online mode of payment. Upon the pressure from the Ballari Milk Union, which procures over 2 lakh litres of milk a day from around 30,500 milk farmers spread across 605 unions in Ballari, Koppal and Raichur district, Ballari DCC Bank has taken up an account opening drive among milk producers so as that it can disburse the payments online. “If all the milk producers have their back accounts in rural district cooperative bank, their payment can be made through online transfer. But, they have bank accounts in various nationalised banks and DCC banks don’t have facility of Real Time Gross Settlement. Upon our request, they have now started bank account opening drive among milk farmers so that they could make online payments within next two months,” Marulu Siddappa, Assistant Manager at Ballari Milk Union told The Hindu. In some societies, milk farmers without bank account are advised to open accounts so that their dues and future payments can be made online. ""Opening a bank account is a tiresome job for them as bank staff are busy with exchanging demonetised notes working overtime,"" said an officer. DCC banks plead helplessness in the matter. “Even if we have enough currency notes in the denomination of Rs. 100 or lesser denomination, we cannot allow milk cooperative societies to draw more than Rs. 24,000 a week as per the government directions,” Sidramareddy Patil, chairman of Kalaburagi DCC Bank, told The Hindu. If there were no restrictions, he added, there would be a good recovery of loans in the banks. KMF officials criticise the Union government for not exempting cooperative societies from restrictions of money transactions at banks. “At least now, the government should either exempt the cooperative societies from transaction restrictions or allow them to draw such amount of money that they require for clearing dues to milk suppliers every week,” Nagappa, an officer working with KMF in Bidar said.

718,2016-11-25,18.0,Cash-driven ancillary units affected by demonetisation,"The impact of demonetisation on ancillary units in the unorganised sector is likely to have a cascading impact on registered manufacturing units in the long run. While there are no accurate records of the number of such units in Mysuru — since they are not registered and hence officially “illegal” — they are the backbone of medium and small scale units in the region as they provide services at throwaway rates. Sources in the industries told The Hindu that the bulk of such ancillary units raised funds through informal sources on a daily or weekly basis at a higher rate of interest. But their source and money supply had evaporated consequent to demonetisation. Though this is reckoned to be a temporary phase, the impact is beginning to be felt and will affect all manufacturing units in Mysuru, according to Suresh Kumar Jain, secretary, Mysore Industries Association. He said the units which flourished in the unorganised sector include printing, welding, lathe workshops, carpentry, electrical wiring, automobile repair shops, and food processing units where transaction is by cash and workers are paid daily. “With cash crunch extending for almost two weeks, daily wage workers are unable to sustain themselves. In addition, there is a withdrawal limit of Rs. 24,000 a week, which is inadequate for the entrepreneur,” Mr. Jain said. In the absence of registration, institutional finance by way of bank loans are not extended to such units and thus, the impact of demonetisation is greater on them. According to Sudhakar Shetty, vice-president, Federation of Karnataka Chamber of Commerce and Industries, there are not less than 12,000 MSME units in the unorganised sector in Mysuru district, employing nearly a lakh people at a conservative estimate. “Daily wagers are not paid in cheques and most have no accounts for money transfer. This transition period is very painful,” Mr. Shetty said. As many entrepreneurs in the micro units do not operate through banks, they do not have overdraft facility or cannot avail themselves of advances available for registered industries. Meanwhile, the MIA is trying to extend assistance to enable them to open bank accounts to bring them to mainstream. Medium and large scale units where payment is through cheques and electronic form have not been affected.

719,2016-11-25,18.0,"Allow use of demonetised currency, demand trade unions","Central trade unions have demanded that the government allow the continued use of demonetised currency notes till the current crisis abates and make arrangements for adequate availability of new currency notes. In a joint press note, the INTUC, CITU, AITUC, and AIUTUC said appropriate compensation should be given to the families of those who died due to this “ordeal.” The unions have asked workers and their trade unions, irrespective of affiliations, to stand by the people and organise agitations throughout the country to raise their voice against the miseries inflicted on them by a “reckless and insensitive government.” Irresponsible action The irresponsible and unprepared actions of the government, on the pretext of curbing black money, has in essence held the lives and livelihood of workers, peasants and the common people — none of whom are from the black money community — to ransom, the press note said. The unions condemned the insensitive, insulting comments and casual behaviour of Union Ministers, the Prime Minister, and ruling party leaders on the sufferings of the people. “Prescription for using credit card and other forms of plastic currency to the suffering millions from the highest position of governance is cruel joke on their daily miseries, hunger and nightmare,” the press note said. The common people, including women, the old, the disabled and sick persons, were being subjected to severe harassment and intimidation while exchanging their own legitimate demonetised currency notes from the banks. They are forced to stand in long queues for days together and at other places while withdrawing their own meagre savings from ATMs. It has also caused unimaginable stress and long hours of work, till midnight, for bank employees. Already 74 people, including a number of bank employees, have died owing to the stress and strain, the press note added.

720,2016-11-25,18.0,?Demonetisation woes of fishermen to be taken to government?s attention?,"Nagercoil: The district administration would send a detailed report to the government on the difficulties faced by the fishermen in coastal areas of Kanniyakumari district due to demonetisation of Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,000 currency notes, Collector Sajjansingh R. Chavan said here on Friday. In reply to oral submissions made by the fishermen at the monthly grievances meeting, Mr. Chavan said the sentiments of the fishermen would be recorded in detail by officials and the report would be forwarded to the government. The fishermen who attended the meeting said they were unable to sell their catch. Even if they managed to sell their catch, buyers were not paying them in cash. They were unable to go for fishing due to the funds crunch, they claimed. When the fishermen complained that they were denied housing facilities under Green House Scheme, Assistant Director of Fisheries Rubert Jothi said the government had allocated 500 Green Houses for the fishermen in village panchayats across the State. A survey of houseless fishermen was undertaken by the department and the report was sent to the government. Only those who had individual pattas would be eligible to get the benefit under Green House Scheme, he said. Mr. Chavan said other fishermen could get housing facility under ‘Housing for All’ Scheme being implemented from the current financial year. The problems expressed by the fishermen on the division of individual pattas would also be taken to the notice of the government, he added. The fishermen, headed by Kanniyakumari District Meen Thozhilalar Sangam secretary Antony, demanded that the biometric identity cards issued by the government should be routed through their association, and not through the officials. District Revenue Officer S. Elango, Deputy Director of Fisheries Lamac, and other officials participated.

Almost every branch of nationalised bank in rural areas across the district was seen overcrowded at several places. On Friday, many farmers queued up for depositing demonetised currencies and for other transactions at the Indian Overseas Bank branch at Alathur Gate. One of the farmers, S. Pazhaniyandi (45) said that though he had been visiting and re-visiting the bank for the past three days to remit Rs. 30,000 towards part re-payment of a jewel loan, he could not do so in the wake of the large number of customers. Women customers were the worst hit. Revathy, an onion grower, said that she could not exchange the old Rs. 500 currency notes till now. “Being an agricultural labourer, I could not spend much time at the bank,” she said. Many Automated Teller Machines remained closed and are yet to be re-filled, forcing the customers to withdraw cash at the bank’s branch. Non-resident Indians too feel the pinch of demonetisation. M. S. Ali, a non-resident of Peralam village in Nagapattinam district, said that he could not withdraw his money for building a house. “I had come to my native place Peralam in Nagapattinam district for constructing a house. But, I am unable to withdraw cash in bulk,” he said.

722,2016-11-25,18.0,Tirupati reels under small currency crisis,": R. Dhanapalan of Arakkonam in Tamil Nadu, who was having lunch at a roadside biryani kiosk, hurriedly washed his hands on seeing his bus pulling into the central bus station at Tirupati. When he handed over a Rs. 500 note to the vendor, expecting his change in return, he received a furious look and was informed that the Rs. 500 note had been completely scrapped and could not be exchanged across a bank counter. A minor tiff ensued till Dhanapalan handed over a Rs. 100 note with a curse. The problem of buying and selling without smaller currency cropped up similarly when little Bhumika of Hoskote wanted to buy a poosalu necklace and ear-rings from a roadside nomadic vendor, but her father refused to part with his ‘precious’ Rs. 100 note. The dormitories behind the Andhra Pradesh State Road Transport Corporation (APSRTC) bus station, which rent out a cot for Rs. 50 a day, are also under pressure to get smaller denominations. The railway station, central bus stand and the Govindaraja Swamy Pushkarini areas in Tirupati, considered the temple city’s buzzing underbelly, are still reeling under the currency crisis, despite the flow of new notes into banks and ATMs. More than the non-availability of new notes, it is the refusal by panic-stricken customers to part with smaller denominations of currency that is causing friction. Unique problem While most transactions in other cities happen between residents and vendors, the situation is quite different in Tirupati, where over 50,000 visiting pilgrims conduct a sizeable number of transactions, taking the requirement for currency of smaller denominations to a new high. As poor and lower middle class visitors are the main customers for roadside hawkers, the products and services on offer are often worth less than Rs.100. On the one hand, ATMs continue to belch out Rs. 2,000 notes and on the other, the new Rs. 500 note remains elusive, making customers as well as vendors hold on to their Rs. 100, Rs. 50 and Rs. 20 notes firmly. Meanwhile, the Andhra Pradesh State Road Transport Corporation (APSRTC) is accepting demonetised Rs. 500 notes on all routes till December 15, being a public utility. APSRTC was able to accept Rs. 1,000 notes till yesterday, too, scoring a point over rivals, even as scores of private bus companies plying to towns in neighbouring Tamil Nadu and Karnataka fumed over the absence of a ‘level playing field’, and thus the loss of business.

| Photo Credit: Sandeep Saxena Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi on Friday continued his tirade against Prime Minister Narendra Modi over his “absence” in the ongoing winter session of Parliament by asking the latter what was he scared of. Mr. Gandhi dared Mr. Modi to participate in the debate in Parliament on demonetisation to clarify everything. The Prime Minister had “laughed” at the misery of people post-demonetisation (during his visit to Japan earlier this month) and become emotional while speaking on the issue, Mr. Gandhi told reporters on the Parliament premises,. “Let’s see what emotions appear on his face when he comes to the Lok Sabha,” Mr. Gandhi said. “The main issue is that the Prime Minister doesn’t come to the Lok Sabha for discussion. The moment he comes to Lok Sabha, doodh ka doodh, paani ka paani ho jayega (everything will be clear). “The Prime Minister doesn’t want to sit in the Lok Sabha. We have been stopped from speaking in the Lok Sabha. What you are you scared of ?” Mr. Gandhi asked. Taking a dig at the Prime Minister over him addressing the Global Citizen Fest nearly a week ago, Mr. Gandhi said the Prime Minister can address “pop concerts” but doesn’t attend discussion on demonetisation in Parliament. ''The moment discussion takes place in the Lok Sabha in the presence of Mr. Modi, it will become clear who the Prime Minister had allegedly told about in advance about the November 8 move,'' he said Mr. Gandhi alleged that BJP leaders were aware of the move. Senior Congress leader Anand Sharma reiterated the Opposition’s demand for Mr. Modi’s presence in Parliament during the demonetisation debate, saying that accountability had to be fixed for the chaos and the financial anarchy caused due to the move. “The Prime Minister has to come [to Parliament). He has to explain. Accoutability has to be fixed...for the chaos and the financial anarchy. Prime Minister is also answerable and so is the RBI governor,” Mr. Sharma said. The demonetisation move ''is an undeclared financial emergency.” The government needs to explain under which law it has put a curb on the withdrawal of “people’s own hard earned money“. “Who authorises them...under which provision of the law they have [imposed withdrawal limit] . . .what is happening in the country is that people have been denied access to their own hard-earned money. No country in the world will allow such a situation to arise which has happened in our country,” he said. Reiterating the demand for a joint parliamentary committee probe the issue, he described demonetisation as a “big scam” and suggested that there was a big surge in bank deposits in September as the information about the move was “selectively leaked.” Printable version | Jan 7, 2017 1:33:09 AM | http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/Rahul-dares-Modi-to-participate-in-demonetisation-debate/article16701365.ece © The Hindu Be it nature’s fury or man’s folly, destructions are alike.

| Photo Credit: Sandeep Saxena Mounting a fresh attack on Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Congress on Friday said leakage of demonetisation decision had helped BJP leaders buy property by converting their black money through various means a few months before it was announced. Leader of Congress in Lok Sabha Mallikarjun Kharge accused the Prime Minister of “selective leakage” of demonetisation move to his own partymen, who converted their black money through property and other avenues. “This shows who are the real supporters of black money,” he told reporters outside Parliament House. Mr. Kharge said democracy functions through discussion and asked the Prime Minister to participate in the debate in Parliament on the issue if he believed in democratic values. “If the Prime Minister believes in democracy, he should come to Parliament and participate in the debate and answer the concerns raised by the opposition on the demonetisation issue. “You think you are a ‘samrat’ (king) and the country runs on the diktat of the ‘samrat’ Instead of speaking outside, you should come to Parliament and speak,” he said. On the Prime Minister not speaking inside Parliament, he said, “If he speaks like this, he knows he could face privilege and contempt.” Terming demonetisation as the “biggest scam”, Congress chief spokesperson Randeep Surjewala also accused Modi of leaking the demonetisation move to top BJP leaders, alleging they bought land using their black money. The party released a list of some BJP leaders who allegedly bought 8 land parcels worth Rs 3.41 crore in Bihar in the run up to the November 8 demonetisation move. Mr. Surjewala, flanked by Congress spokespersons Rajiv Gowda and Sushmita Dev, alleged that post expose of deposit of money in bank accounts of BJP leaders just before the demonetisation, “documents now prove” that BJP leaders bought the land. “Modiji’s mask of fighting black money is off. Stop mocking the people of India and Parliament and look in the mirror. Make all BJP accounts public and tell the details of all property purchased by BJP leaders over the last one year and the truth of demonetisation scam will be out,” he said. “Layers of demonetisation scam are getting unearthed by the day as a series of BJP transactions get exposed. Demonetisation is emerging as the biggest scam that needs to be probed through JPC and responsibility fixed,” Mr. Surjewala said.

Biswaranjan Rout A day after former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh termed the demonetisation move a “monumental management failure”, BJP president Amit Shah hit back with a jibe, saying people sitting on huge black money only feel the pain of it. “Manmohanji was making a statement in the Rajya Sabha. He felt a lot of pain because of demonetisation decision. Nobody keeps cash of Rs. 10 crore or Rs. 20 crore in the house. So a common man will not lose anything due to demonetisation. But people who stand to lose huge black money can feel the pain,” Mr. Shah said at a party rally here on Friday. “Till November 7, the whole Opposition was asking Modiji what steps you have taken to tackle black money. Since the evening of November 8, they were asking why you took this step. I want to ask them what you have lost,” he said. “The glow on the face of Opposition parties has faded,” said Mr. Shah. “The situation is like a high flood in the Mahanadi. There is water everywhere. And one old tree is still not uprooted. To take shelter, a cat, mouse, snake and common mongoose climb on the tree. But, the mouse is not afraid of the cat and the common mongoose does not attack the snake. Everybody is waiting for the water to recede for climbing down the tree,” he said.  “Following the demonetisation flood, the Congress, TMC, Samajwadi Party, AAP and Mayawati have gathered in one platform. They are waiting for the overwhelming support for demonetisation move to diminish,” he said. “In one strike, Modiji has taken steps to eliminate black money for the welfare of the poor. The people are with the Prime Minister,”he asserted. “Prime Minister Modi has been working for the development of the country. When he came to power in 2014, the country was stuck in recession and whole world believed that India’s growth story had ended. Now, the world reckons that the 21st century belongs to India. Under the stewardship of Mr. Modi, our country has become the fastest growing economy in the world,” he said. Taking a potshot at Congress vice president Rahul Gandhi, Mr. Shah said, “He was questioning the steps being taken to defend the country’s boundary. When the UPA was ruling under the leadership of Manmohan Singh and Sonia Gandhi, regular attacks were taking place along the border, but enemies were not getting the retaliation. After the Modi government took charge, if bullets were fired from Pakistan’s soil, the same was being responded with mortar. For this, soldiers need not require permission every time they want to strike back.” Printable version | Jan 7, 2017 1:33:14 AM | http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/People-sitting-on-huge-black-money-only-feel-the-pain-of-demonetisation-Shah/article16700887.ece © The Hindu Sita Sahani offers a snapshot of life in the time of note bans and smartphones"

Responding to a question on digital payment systems, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley said the government wanted the physical currency to come down and be substituted by digital currency. While physical currency should decline, business and commerce should prosper. He said out of 80 crore debit cards, 40 crore were actively used at ATMs. Electronic wallets and digital transfer of funds was the future technology which the government is encouraging and has asked various state governments to contribute. Mr. Jaitley also said a dedicated fund under depositor education and awareness was in place for expanding acceptance, infrastructure and conducting awareness campaign among people for a cashless society. Cashless society would mean less investment in handling cash, transparency in payments and check on fake currency, he said.

727,2016-11-25,18.0,Bengal?s potato growers hit by demonetisation,"Chitra Bag and her family of six are eating less these days. They make do with one meal instead of the usual three meals, despite a gruelling 8-10 hours of work daily as landless farm labourers. Even though vegetables, grown around their mud-thatched house, are still available, Ms. Bag and her family have drastically cut back on pulses, salt, flour and oil they buy from the neighbourhood grocer. Because he doesn’t extend credit any longer. Chitra can’t pay in new currency notes as her employer paid her in old notes. “Earlier, the six of us were consuming five kilogram of pulses and 10 kilogram of atta [wheat flour], every month, and about three litres of cooking oil and one kilogram of salt. No longer do we do so,” Ms. Bag told this reporter. “We are splitting one meal into two as grocers are refusing to give salt, sugar or pulses on credit,” Ms Bag said. Nearly all workers, about 30 in number, in the swathes of farmland in the Bhabanipur village of Jamalpur Block, said they were now being refused credit by the neighbourhood grocer. The grocer — a middle-aged man — said he could not “extend any more credit” as customers were paying in old bank notes. Jamalpur, adjacent to Singur town, on the banks of river Damodar, is known for its rich alluvial soil. But demonetisation has slowed down cultivation at the peak of the sowing season of potato, the main cash crop of Bengal, affecting the earnings of nearly 200,000 farmers and labourers in Jamalpur. According to the Indian Council of Agricultural Research, about 3,87,000 hectares of land — second only to Uttar Pradesh — was under potato cultivation in 2012. That amounts to five per cent of the State’s total area. Since Bengal’s industrial economy is not as healthy as most other States, it depends on agro produce, mainly potato. Ms. Bag — who was last paid for MGNREGA work in May — had little option but to tender old notes as her employer, Chittaranjan Das, a small farmer, did not hand out pay in 100-rupee notes. Mr. Das, like other farmers in rural Bengal, has just sold the harvested kharif crop (paddy) and taken the cash to the cold storage to pay for the potato seeds for the coming season. He found that all the 15 cold storages of Jamalpur had stopped accepting old notes. He told The Hindu that neither could he go to the bank to deposit and withdraw the money as it was “a time-consuming affair” in the potato sowing season. The potato seeds — which are tubers of the previous year — are preserved in storages by the farmers around March. In November, the storages are paid to take out preserved seed-potatoes, planted and placed in four-inch deep trenches with the help of labourers for harvesting in March. About 1.5 lakh tonnes of potatoes are produced in Jamalpur annually. Crisis time “Since stores stopped taking [old] notes, notes, all in white, are piling up and I had to pay [the labourers] those notes,” Mr. Das said. Moreover, November 30 is the last date to withdraw seeds from the cold storages. “If the farmers fail to take the seeds out by then, the store owners may destroy the seeds,” warned Sheikh Mehruddin, one of the more prosperous farmers. The consequence would be acute shortage of potato in the retail market. ‘We are helpless’ The officials of one of the largest stores of Jamalpur – Sethia Cold Storage – accepted that minor scuffles were breaking out. But, like Mr. Das, they pleaded helplessness. “We are instructed not to accept old currency notes,” an official of Sethia Cold Storage said. Former president of Cold Storage Owners’ Association Gurupada Sinha held the Central government responsible for the situation. Indicating that it would be “difficult” for them to hold the stock after November 30, Mr. Sinha said the government “should intervene.” Realising that the situation is spiralling out of control, the store-owners, merchants’ federation and Bengal’s Minister of Agriculture Marketing met on Wednesday. The problem, however, remains “unresolved”, Baren Mondal, general secretary of the Merchants’ Association, said. He said they would meet again in the coming week. “But if it is not resolved, the lives and livelihood of crores of people in rural Bengal and potato-growing States will be affected,” he warned.   Printable version | Jan 7, 2017 1:33:18 AM | http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/Bengal%E2%80%99s-potato-growers-hit-by-demonetisation/article16700031.ece © The Hindu Sita Sahani offers a snapshot of life in the time of note bans and smartphones"

  A Supreme Court Bench led by Chief Justice of India T.S. Thakur said on Friday that the judiciary will “certainly” hear the ground realities and weigh the constitutionality of the November 8 RBI notification scrapping the high-denomination currency notes. The court’s assurance came as random accusations of “maximum cash has gone into BJP hands” and “people are starving on the roads” overawed decorum at the hearing, with the Bench urging lawyers to maintain the dignity of the court. In a much-anticipated hearing on the demonetisation issue, the apex court said it would comprehensively hear arguments on various questions raised in the issue on December 2. These include the hardships caused by demonetisation, the transferring of petitions filed in the various High Courts to Delhi, whether these petitions should be heard by the Delhi High Court or the Supreme Court itself, the constitutional validity of the RBI notification of November 8, and finally, whether the issue should be referred to a Constitution Bench. In this, the Bench accepted the suggestion of the government that it was better to hear the demonetisation issue in its totality on December 2 rather than in a piecemeal fashion. Attorney-General Mukul Rohatgi submitted that the government's petition to transfer all demonetisation-related cases from other High Courts to the National Capital was already scheduled for hearing on December 2. In that case, the four separate petitions — listed today for hearing on Friday — should also be heard on the same day, Mr Rohatgi said, as this would ensure that the court takes an informed decision after considering all aspects of the issue.    Chaotic scenes The morning’s hearing began with senior advocate Kapil Sibal, appearing for a petitioner, claiming that “people were starving on the roads.” “Nobody is starving on the roads,” Mr. Rohatgi said, dismissing the claim peremptorily. “The markets are closed,” Mr. Sibal shot another barb at the demonetisation exercise to weed out black money. At this point, advocate Manohar Lal Sharma, who claims that the new Rs. 2000 bank notes bleed easily and can be faked, wrested the floor from Mr. Sibal, claiming “all the banks are closed”. “Maximum cash has gone into BJP hands,” Mr. Sharma declared as shouts of protest erupted inside the court. Then lawyers vied with each other, raising their hands for the court's attention as pandemonium seemed imminent. Chief Justice Thakur, on the Bench along with Justice D.Y. Chandrachud, had maintained silence all through. But as the shouting continued, he Chief Justice reined in the confusion by issuing a stern warning that the court would adjourn the hearing by another six weeks unless order was restored immediately. “Everyone is shouting with their hands over the other's shoulder. This is a courtroom and there is some decorum to be observed here. We will adjourn the case for hearing after the vacation,” Chief Justice Thakur addressed the crowded courtroom. “There are some really serious issues here, My Lords,” Mr. Sibal interceded. “If there is a difficulty, you tell us what the problems are,” Chief Justice Thakur addressed the senior lawyer. “There is a lot of inconvenience. They don't have the capacity to print the new currency... what are they going to do?” Mr. Sibal said. “If you want us to look into it... We will certainly do... But we will hear all. We cannot hear this issue piecemeal,” Chief Justice Thakur said, refusing Mr. Sibal's plea to advance the hearing to next Tuesday.

The CPI (M) leader added that 32 million people have not been paid their wages. He pointed out that as many as 16 notifications had been brought out by the Centre on this issue till now. Mr. Yechury also took to twitter to claim that the move was adversely affecting people, sharing a newspaper report that said this was the immediate number of people, mostly daily wage labourers, out of employment in sectors like garments, leather and jewellery. He shared a report claiming India had the lowest ATM density among BRICS nations, at 18 ATMs per one lakh population. Mr. Yechury tweeted to elaborate his point, sharing 2014 data on ATM density in India, compared to other BRICS nations. India ranked last with just 18 ATMs per one-lakh people. “Digital payments, ATMs, rural banking, cash transactions. Well, facts don't matter when one man gets a brainwave,” he said. He tweeted just before this: “In Modi govt, 1.12-lakh crore loans waived, 1% Indians have 58.4% of wealth, millions of jobs lost. To distract, demonetisation disaster.” Claiming the move to be disastrous to farmers, Mr. Yechury tweeted: “Whether cotton or wheat, Modi's Tughlaqi firman of demonetisation is an unmitigated disaster for farmers across India.” Addressing a peasants' rally here at Jantar Mantar, Mr. Yechury said the Modi government should waive loans of farmers to ameliorate their sufferings as it has done for corporates. The left party has also filed a petition in the Supreme Court against the demonetisation move.

  Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday hit out at the critics of the demonetisation of Rs 500 and Rs 1000, saying that those accusing the government of not being prepared for demonetisation were themselves not ready for the move. “If they had got even 72 hours, they would have praised me. We have taken a very big decision,” he said at a function in Parliament’s library building to release new editions of the Constitution of India on the eve of Constitution Day. The Prime Minister claimed strong public support for his move, saying, “the common citizen of India has become a soldier against corruption and black money. Every person has a right to spend his or her money. No one can take anyone's money.” He made a strong pitch for the use of electionic transactions in preference to cash exchanges. “Now people can spend through mobile technology also,” he said. According to senior government sources,Mr. Modi, during Thursday’s Cabinet meet, urged the ministers to run a campaign to encourage electronic transfers of money. Finance Minister Arun Jaitley too, in a video conference with banking heads, urged that banks should encourage as far as possible, the use of debit cards among their customers in preference to taking out currency. Mr. Modi, in his speech on Friday, pointed out that India was often ranked low in global rankings on corruption. “We need to improve it,” he said.

  Opening the attack on the government for its decision to scrap the high-value Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,000 notes, former prime minister Manmohan Singh told the Rajya Sabha on Thursday that ‘50-days’ was like a torture that could have a disastrous effect on the poor and the deprived. He termed the implementation of the demonetisation a case of “organised loot and legalised plunder.” Describing the exercise as a “monumental disaster,” Dr. Singh said the decision could lead to the GDP declining by two percentage points. “This is an underestimate and not an overestimate,” he said. Squarely putting the blame on Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who attended the House for the first time since the winter session commenced and also the first time since he announced demonetisation on November 8, he said, “The ordinary people have suffered as a result of this imposition on the country overnight by the PM.” Referring to John Maynard Keynes, an influential British economist of the 20th centu- ry on Mr. Modi’s call to wait for 50 days, Dr. Singh said, “I am reminded of John Key- nes, who once said ‘In the long run, we are all dead’.” ‘Govt. must take action’ Later he told The Hindu that the government should “reflect” on his speech in Parliament for answers on how to move ahead. “It is for the government to reflect on what we have said in Parliament. It is not for me to say what they should do, the government must take action,” he said on his six-minute speech in the House. Dr. Singh added that “all governments have considered [demonetisation measures] from time to time,” but declined to add why he had rejected the idea during his tenure. When asked why he had used strong terms like “organised plunder” and “legalised loot”, Dr. Singh said, “Well that is what the common people feel, they feel that way.” Deaths in the queue Earlier, Dr. Singh opened the discussion on demonetisation as soon as the Rajya Sabha resumed operations at noon as Prime Minister Narendra Modi walked in at 12 noon, amid hoots by the Opposition benches. The debate resumed by suspending the Question Hour. He asked the Prime Minister to name “any country he may think of where people have deposited their money in the bank but they are not allowed to withdraw their money,” which alone “is enough to condemn” what has been done in the name of greater good of the people. “It is no good that every day the banking system comes with modification of the rules, the conditions under which people can withdraw money. That reflects very poorly on the Prime Minister's Office, on the Finance Minister's Office and on the Reserve Bank of India. I am very sorry that the RBI has been exposed to this sort of criticism, which, I think, is fully justified,” Dr. Singh said.

They formed a human chain at Ambedkar Circle and burnt tyres raising slogans against the BJP-led National Democratic Alliance government at the Centre. They alleged that Prime Minister Narendra Modi took a huge step with no minimum preparation. “It shows our Prime Minister’s short-sightedness. He announced the decision without making any preparations for alternative ways to deal with the shortage of currency. As a result, common people are suffering,” Ravi Boseraju, a Youth Congress leader said during the agitation. The agitators also expressed their anger over the introduction of Rs. 2,000 notes in place of the demonetised notes as a gap-filler. They said that the Rs. 2,000 note created the problem of “change” for smaller transactions. “Grocery shops don’t accept Rs. 2,000 notes for smaller bills. Even if they did, they ask the costumers to deposit the note and keep on purchasing till the bill reaches the face value of the note. The condition is same with autorickshaw drivers, petty shops, milk vendors and other petty business establishments,” Ravindra Jaldar, a Congress leader said. Rudrappa Angadi, Chandrashekhar Reddy, G.

While some are developing products that can address issues faced by people to a certain extent, the others are coming up with innovative payment methods and offers to not just retain the customer base but also to increase it. Incubated in T-Hub is a start-up that has developed a portal that was born to reduce the inconvenience faced by the people standing in long queues outside banks for depositing, withdrawing or exchanging currency. The team of Loan Yatra has developed www.bankQ.in as a philanthropic activity. “We came up with a solution of booking a slot in all the branches of all the banks in India. This would allow people to book a prior appointment and on that specific day, the user would go to the bank and carry out the required transaction. We made sure that the solution we have created is available to a common man even for those having key pad dialling mobile too with no internet using an IVR system,” said Vijayananda Reddy Kalluru, founder of Loan Yatra. An engineering innovations company, Express Bike Works promises to wash the dirtiest of the motorcycles under five minutes. With a busy centre in Kothaguda in the city, the company has rolled out a tempting offer to bring customers in to the fold of an online payment mode. Those who are making payment through Paytm will be charged only Rs. 10 for their first bike wash instead of the regular price of Rs. 200. “Our customers are mostly middle-income group. There was apprehension among them after the government’s decision of demonetisation. Since we wanted them to get used to the online payment mode, we came out with this offer,” said Niraj Taksande, co-founder of Entropy Innovations. For some start-ups, severe shortage of currency notes has also helped in improving their business. The Hyderabad-based Anytime Loan, a peer-to-peer lending platform, has seen a 35per cent jump in the last 20 days. K.K. Jain of Anytime Loans said that the borrowers and lenders were increasingly doing business online.

735,2016-11-25,18.0,DMK holds massive human chain protests against hardships caused by demonetisation,"The DMK, led by its treasurer M.K. Stalin, on Thursday staged a massive protest against the hardship caused to the people due to the Centre’s demonetisation scheme, by forming human chains across the State for an hour in the evening. While Mr. Stalin participated in the protest in Chennai, regional leaders led the protests in the districts and Puducherry Chief Minister and Congress leader V. Narayanasamy joined the human chain in the Union Territory. Slamming the Centre and Prime Minister Narendra Modi for the demonetisation of Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,000, Mr. Stalin said while the DMK was not opposed to the plan to eliminate black money, the sudden and unplanned announcement had caused untold hardships and misery to the small traders, middle and lower middle class citizens, and traders. “This protest is not to condemn the demonetisation by the Centre, but to condemn its implementation (without adequate planning),” he said. “The Central government keeps saying the people are with them, they are supporting this move…even the Tamil Nadu government might say that. But people are struggling and are queuing up outside banks and ATMs for long. This situation has to be rectified,” the DMK leader said in his constituency, Kolathur. Mr. Stalin had flagged off the protest at Purasawalkam here, before setting off on an open autorickshaw towards Kolathur. At Kolathur, he got down from the auto and joined the human chain for a few minutes. Elsewhere in Chennai, DMK cadre formed a human chain, leading to traffic jams. Mr. Stalin also slammed the Centre for the shoddy implementation and the introduction of the Rs. 2,000 denomination note. “The government should have ensured that Rs. 100 denomination notes and the new Rs. 500 notes were in adequate supply before banning the old notes. If they had done that, the people would not be suffering like this. People with black money are not affected at all,” he said. Various leaders and former ministers of the DMK led the protests in all districts. The protesters carried placards slamming the Centre and the State government on the issue.

736,2016-11-25,18.0,Karunanidhi urges cadre to make demonetisation stir a success,": Alleging that the cash crisis due to demonetisation has severely hit the common people, DMK chief M. Karunanidhi on Thursday urged his party cadre to participate in large numbers in the nationwide agitation called by the Opposition on November 28. “Though it has been 16 days since Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced the demonetisation of Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,000 notes without any prior alert, the cash crunch is yet to be resolved. The hardship suffered by the poor and the marginalised, middle-class, farmers, fishermen, weavers and small traders, amongst others is unfathomable,” Mr. Karunanidhi said in a statement. Referring to the recent statement of Union Minister M. Venkaiah Naidu that rolling back something was not in Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s blood, the DMK chief said the BJP leader’s statement was adding fuel to the fire. Since the leaders of various political parties, which opposed demonetisation have called for an agitation in front of central government offices in all district headquarters on November 28, Mr. Karunanidhi urged his party cadre to take part in large numbers with the support of the general public to raise their voice against the anti-people decision of the BJP government.

737,2016-11-25,18.0,"Former SBI employee kills self, blames Modi?s demonetisation","In happier times: Anant Mukund Bapat flanked by his children. —
  SAONER: A former State Bank of India (SBI) employee allegedly committed suicide at his home in Soaner town of Nagpur district on November 20 and left a suicide note citing “Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s demonetisation” as a reason for his suicide. “Anant Mukund Bapat, (58), committed suicide at his home in Soaner sometime between 11 am to 4 pm on Sunday (November 20). He was alone at his home when he ended his life. We found a suicide note from his home which mentions the demonetisation of higher currency notes as a reason for the suicide,” Vikaram Kadam, the Deputy Superintendent of Police (DySP) in charge of Soaner police station told The Hindu. “The undisclosed amount, I had, has become useless because of prime minister Modi’s announcement of demonetisation. I had collected it [undisclosed amount] for Mrunmai’s [his daughter] wedding, but because of Modi’s announcement, it is no more legal. I could not gather the courage to inform my Charted Account about it. Forgive me, my kids, I am going away and making you orphans,” read Mr. Bapat’s suicide note. Mr. Bapat had taken voluntary retirement from his job as an agriculture officer in the SBI in 2004. He lost his wife in 2014 and is survived by son Parikshit and daughter Mrunmai. “After quitting his job, he had set up a small business of supply of irrigation material,” informed Mr. Bapat’s friend Mr. Tejsingh Soaji. The suicide note of Mr. Bapat also said that he had committed mistakes in his life and begged for forgiveness from his children. “I have committed mistakes and I take its complete responsibility. Please continue Mrunmai’s education and use my insurance and mutual fund amount. Use the gold in bank lockers to pay all the debt,” read the suicide note and asked his children to pay the tax on the undisclosed amount. The police, however, could not find any high denomination currency from his home. “We searched his home but we could not find any bigger amount in the form of Rs.500 or Rs.1000 notes. We are also trying to ascertain the authenticity of the suicide note,” informed Mr. Kadam. But Mr. Bapat’s son Parikshit refused to believe that “demonetisation” was a reason for his father’s suicide. “I don’t think that [demonetisation] was a reason. We are not in a position to divulge anything. We know the truth and we have told the police everything,” Parikshit Bapat told The Hindu over the phone. Namdev Saoji, a close friend of Mr. Bapat, said it was tough to believe that he killed himself because of demonetisation. “He was a jolly man. I never saw him depressed. He was a religious person and would give advice to everyone. He had asked his son to shift with him a month ago and help him in his business,” informed Mr. Saoji, a retail daily goods trader, whose business has come down by “80 percent” due to the demonetisation. “As an owner of a retail shop a few years ago, he would give bills to his customers on every purchase. It is hard to believe that he had amassed illegal wealth,” stated Mr. Tejsingh Saoji. According to the DySP, Mr. Bapat’s daughter is studying in Pune and his son was away in Nagpur when the 58-year-old committed suicide by using a nylon rope.

The PCC organised a demonstration in front of the post office on Thursday to protest the Centre’s decision. They shouted slogans against Prime Minister Narendra Modi for putting public to hardship in the name of fighting corruption. Addressing the protesters, Chief Minister V. Narayanasamy said the decision by the Prime Minister to demonetise higher denomination currency notes would not help in curbing black money. Instead, he said, it would only create hardship to the public and destabilise the economy. People were finding it difficult to meet their daily expenses. Farmers across the country were facing resource crunch to carry out farming. The value of rupee had come down after demonetisation of Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,000 currency notes. Mr. Narayanasamy questioned the Prime Minister’s rationale of not attending the Parliament when the House had taken up for discussion the demonetisation issue. “The Congress is not against any decision to fight black money. But the decision of the Union Government had caused difficulty to the common people and will hurt economic growth. The Congress will continue to raise the inconvenience caused to the public,” he said. The demonetisation issue, he said, would propel the Congress back to power at Centre as the public had realised the folly of electing the BJP to power. Minister for Public Works and PCC president A. Namassivayam said the common man had been largely affected by the Centre’s decision to demonetise high-value currency. The decision was taken without proper planning, he added. Minister for Revenue M.O.H.F. Shahjahan, Minister for Social Works M. Kandasamy, Minister for Electricity R. Kamalakannan, PCC functionaries, and DMK leader S.P Sivakumar participated in the demonstration. Human chain Later, DMK organised a human chain covering most parts of the town. The party cadre shouted slogans against the Prime Minister and the NDA government. Chief Minister and PCC chief also joined the DMK cadres in the human chain. ‘Normality soon’ Meanwhile, a senior official with a private bank said the situation had improved drastically and by month end most of ATMs would be recalibrated. Now, the rush was for depositing money and withdrawal of cash unlike in the beginning when people queued up to exchange notes, he added.

N. Periyasami, district secretary, Thoothukudi South, who led the programme, in Thoothukudi central, said the common people were the worst hit due to the demonetisation exercise as cash was out of reach for them. The demonetisation policy was implemented all of a sudden overnight and people had no alternative but to spend most of their time waiting in front of ATMs and banks to withdraw money and exchange demonetised notes. Many ATMs remained closed and some remained open without cash. Hence, normal life was affected everywhere as people did not have money in their pockets, he said. P. Geetha Jeevan, Thoothukudi MLA and others took part in the human chain. In Tiruchendur, the DMK-men led by MLA Anitha R. Radhakrishnan staged a similar protest opposite Tiruchendur bus stand.

The team headed by N. Sivasailam, Additional Secretary, Union Finance Department, called on Chief Minister Siddaramaiah and Cooperation Minister H.S. Mahadeva Prasad and held discussions on the impact of demonetisation on the State economy, particularly on the functioning of the cooperative sector. Officials of the Cooperation Department briefed the team about the adverse impact of the Centre’s decision on the functioning of cooperative societies, milk unions, sericulture sector, agriculture produce marketing committees (APMCs), and the rural economy. Farmers are unable to repay loans to cooperative banks owing to scrapping of high value currencies, the officials told the team. To get a feel of the ground reality, the team visited DCC Bank, milk cooperatives, and APMCs in Belagavi city and assessed their functioning, sources said. The cooperatives have set a target of disbursing Rs. 1,068 crore to farmers between November, 2016 and January, 2017. Owing to shortage of currencies, cooperatives have not been able to grant or recover loans, officials told the team, sources said.

In Sivaganga, former ministers K. R. Periyakaruppan and M. Thennvan led the protest. Demand They demanded the centre to withdraw the demonetisation as all sections of the society, especially the poor and downtrodden faced trouble in view of severe cash crunch. After withdrawing about 80 per cent of the currencies in circulation, the Centre failed to bring in new currencies and ease the situation, they said. The new 2000 rupee note was of no use to the public as they could not get change, they said. Slogans The protesters also raised slogans against Prime Minister Narendra Modi for putting the people of the country in trouble.

743,2016-11-25,18.0,?Demonetisation will not achieve stated objectives?,"A panel of economists who met at the Madras Institute of Development Studies (MIDS) to discuss the demonetisation policy of the central government said that the stated objectives of the policy will not be fulfilled. “Essentially, collectively, the panellists have made the following points — that....we are certain that the stated intentions of the government will not be served well,” said Venkatesh B. Athreya, summarising the discussion on behalf of his three co-panellists. The session, called Understanding Demonetisation: Issues and Challenges, was held at a packed Adiseshiah Auditorium and moderated by C. Lakshmanan of MIDS. The panellists’ interaction with the audience was disrupted multiple times due to arguments between supporters and critics of the policy. Demand crash “What we are saying is that, there is both — pain now, and absolutely no prospect of realising the intentions in the medium or long run,” said Mr. Athreya. He said that more data was needed before making forecasts about the economy. “We can definitely say that, in the short term, there will be a demand crash, in the medium term, there will be a production scarcity,” he said, warning that inflationary tendencies would result. “The declared objectives may not have been the real objectives — that is the speculation,” said Mr. Athreya, who assigned political motives to the Prime Minister’s announcement. RBI governor’s role “There used to be an institution called the RBI in this country. Its Governor is the most invisible person today; I wonder if he has joined the black economy,” he said, mentioning he was talking as a political economist. “All of us have said enough that the moves made by the government lack credibility. We have cast enough doubt on the motives of the government,” said S. Subramanian, formerly with MIDS, who termed the move an unqualified disaster. “Ultimately, what we are guaranteeing is a redistribution of wealth from actual defaulters to a set of either the same defaulters or a set of potential defaulters,” he said. Impact on farmers S. Janakarajan, also with MIDS, said that the policy had affected farmers and its impact would manifest itself in subsequent seasons, leading to food inflation. He said the informal sector would bear the brunt of the move, citing interactions with ragpickers on the East Coast Road over the past fortnight. “They are all going to be dead in the 50-55 days the Prime Minister wants to normalise things,” he said Carpet bombing Jothi Sivaganam, head of the department of economics at the University of Madras, said that the government was resorting to carpet bombing, instead of a surgical strike to target unaccounted wealth. “We are squeezing liquidity because of the government’s constraints in supplying currency,” he said.

744,2016-11-25,18.0,Demonetisation brings temporary relief to powerloom workers,"The demonetisation move has brought temporary relief to the cash-starved workers of the powerloom industry in the Nagari Assembly constituency. Spread over the Nagari and Puttur municipalities, over 35,000 families depend on the cloth manufacturing cottage industry. The industry is dominated by about three dozen influential families managing a workforce of nearly 20,000 at their looms in Satrawada, Chintala Patteda, Kothapeta and Ekambarakuppam in Nagari bordering with Tamil Nadu and Gate Puttur in Puttur town. Interestingly, the families living in TN villages of RK Peta and Poddutur Peta near Nagari also work in the looms. Till two decades ago, the industry registered multi-crore growth but the hay days had gradually declined. Still, the industry has a thumping presence and is all set to albeit slowly recover from its drooping fortunes. Most of the families are dependent on the patronage of their bosses. The cloth is exported to Mumbai, Chennai, Surat and other cities in the north. Immediately after the demonetisation was announced, the workers in the big units heaved a sigh of relief. Each worker on an average gets a weekly wage between Rs 2000-3000. The workers at Ekambarakuppam said though the norm is weekly payment, they are paid once in three months, and that too in small amounts. Sometimes, the payments would be pending for over six months and the owners would shell considerably big amounts during the festivals — with a promise to settle the balances at the earliest — to ward off unrest. However, during the last two weeks, the owners have embarked on a massive mission of collecting the bank passbooks and ATM cards of the workers and depositing amounts ranging between Rs 1 lakh and 2.5 lakhs in each account. Instead of at one go, the amount was said to have been deposited over four or five slots. A family at Satrawada on condition of anonymity said two of their members work in a powerloom and wages to the tune of Rs 1.5 lakhs had been pending to them since four months. “We were given Rs. 2 lakh each in three slots to deposit the amounts in our accounts. Our passbooks and ATMs were kept in their [owners] possession. In return, we were given Rs. 500 and Rs. 1000 demonetised currency to the tune of Rs. 10,000 each. We are trying our level best to exchange the scrapped notes by travelling in APSRTC buses and at petrol bunks. Something is better than nothing. Apart from this, we have been getting the demonetised currency as our wages since a week. This we are again keeping with us, trying to exchange in various modes.

745,2016-11-25,18.0,Small vendors struggle to tide over crisis post demonetisation,"Worry is writ large on the faces of garment-seller Mohammed Ismail, watch seller F. Anto, and fruit vendor Kumar Durai, all small traders in the city. In the past couple of weeks they have spent the same amount of money, time and energy commuting to their shops and trying to sell their wares as they did last month. But, bundles of items remain unsold in all their shops. Mr. Durai, a fruit vendor in Flower Bazaar, who used to earn a minimum of Rs. 500 a day pushing his cart through the streets of Flower Bazaar, now hardly makes Rs. 400 in two days. “It is not that I don’t get customers. I turn away at least 30 customers who have only Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,000 notes. I am also worried about the quality of my stock of fruits. If they wither, I stand to lose my capital as well,” he said. For many fruit, flower and vegetable vendors, the threat of loss of capital is a major issue. M. Mala, a retail vegetable vendor in Koyambedu market, hardly takes home Rs. 150 a day in place of the Rs. 1,500 she got till last month because she doesn’t have any change. “What I get now is just enough for food and travel. I am unable to repay my loan of Rs. 5,000 from the Mahila bank. The vegetables are rotting and no one is willing to give me credit,’ she said, almost in tears. The inability to do what they had been doing for all these years was an irritant, said Mr. Ismail, who has been selling garments at the same spot in Triplicane for the past 40 years. He said he was worried about how to meet expenses in the coming days. “I wont be able to pay the rent and electricity bill or buy groceries if I am not able to make a minimum sale every day,” he said. With their families mostly dependent on their incomes, people are worried about whether they will have enough food. Mr. Anto, who sells wallets and watches on Anna Salai, said that he was struggling to earn even Rs. 200 a day. A resident of Nandiambakkam, near Minjur, he has two sons, who are looking for jobs. His wife works as a help in a church. “This month will be very difficult for us,” he said. People like C. Veeramani, a cobbler, have not been coming in to work because of the lack of business. “I've only come today and barely making enough for tea,” he said. Shops that run on small change are suffering too. Shahul Hameed, who sells paan and chocolates in his small shop, complained that business had lessened by nearly half. “What do we do when people have no change to spare?” he said. The lack of availability of small denomination notes in banks is a problem small traders like Nadeem, a butcher in Neelankarai face. “None of the banks in our area give us change. Most often, hotels send notes of large denomination so that they can get change. If we spend the whole day standing in queues in front of banks, when will we sell the meat?” he asked. V. Mageshvaran, State general secretary, Tamil Nadu Street Vending Workers Federation, said nearly 80 per cent of the street vendors had lost business. Most of them are in debt as they have to borrow for their daily needs. Banks must come forward to provide loans at less interest rate for vendors, he said. ( With inputs from Zubeda Hamid, S.

746,2016-11-25,18.0,Collectors of deposits on the warpath against demonetisation,"Thousands of cooperative bank deposit collectors are on the warpath following the Centre’s decision to demonetise the high- denomination currency notes from November 9. They say that the declaration that Rs.500 and Rs.1,000 notes were no longer legal tender had almost robbed them of their livelihood. “Our jobs have come to a standstill and our future is uncertain,” Dinesh Perumanna, general secretary, Cooperative Banks Deposit Collectors Association (CBDCA), said. Nearly 25,000 people are employed in this segment of collecting deposits on a daily or periodical basis from shops, households and institutions. The daily collection is Rs.49 crore to Rs.50 crore in the State. “However, the commission an agent gets is only Rs.10 to Rs.20 for every Rs.1,000 collected. Now, the majority are on the verge of poverty,” he said. Following the demonetisation, the Centre had restricted even the District Cooperative Banks, which functioned under the Banking Regulation Act, from exchanging the invalid notes. The situation at the primary cooperative banks and cooperative societies is even worse where they are disallowed to swap the Rs.500 and Rs.1,000 currency notes collected before the declaration of the demonetisation. “We also want the State government to provide interim relief for collection agents till the financial condition normalises,” Mr. Perumanna said. The State conference of the CBDCA, which will be held in Kozhikode on November 26 and 27, will chalk out agitation plans against the Centre. Protest would be held in front of the RBI office as well, he said.

747,2016-11-25,18.0,Price of banana falls due to demonetisation,"The demonetisation of high value denomination notes has hit banana growers and traders. Prices of the fruit have fallen sharply as farmers seek to sell their produce quickly. However, arrival of bananas continue to remain high at the wholesale market at Gandhi Market as the fruit cannot be stocked for long. Occurrence of mist in parts of the district, especially in Musiri, Thottiyam and Namakkal areas, has hastened the harvest as the fruit would ripen quickly. A. Vijayendran who has been trading in banana for the past four decades, says that ‘poovan’ and ‘rasthali’ are usually the main arrivals during November and December. Arrivals continue to remain high and normally, the market receives about 8,000 bunches a day. “On Wednesday, I received 500 bunches and on Thursday the arrivals doubled. This has caused a dip in price and a bunch of banana was being sold at about Rs.100 against the normal price of Rs.240 to Rs. 300,” he said. Farmers also wanted cash in denominations of Rs. 100 and not Rs. 500 or Rs. 1,000 due to demonetisation, he said. Another dealer, V. Muniappan, said that being a perishable produce, both farmers and wholesale dealers have been seeking to sell their stocks quickly to raise cash ever since the demonetisation. “Shortage of currency notes of lower denomination has created problems in completing the transactions,” he added. Traders said that though banana prices tend to dip during the monsoon period, the demonetisation has caused a further fall as farmers are looking to sell the fruits which ripen quickly.

DMK members alleged that since November 8, normal life had been affected due to Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s sudden announcement on demonetising Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,000 currency notes from circulation. They also charged the Tamil Nadu government for not voicing the common man’s concerns in this issue. When Chief Ministers from many States had opposed the Centre’s move as unilateral and demanded immediate withdrawal, the AIADMK government here was nonchalant about all the happenings.

At Poonamallee, people picketed the arterial road alleging that bank officials had refused to exchange notes citing shortage of cash. As it was the last day for exchanging invalid notes over the counter, a large number of people stood in queue before Indian Overseas Bank at the junction connecting Kumananchavadi and Kundrathur since early morning. The anxiety among the customers grew when bank staff opened the bank at 9.30 am but did not open the gate till 10 a.m. As customers started shouting, the staff came out and reportedly told them that currencies have not reached the office yet. They said they would disburse the currencies if they received them. The customers sat on the road, leading to traffic disruption. The police rushed to the spot and held talks with them. Later, the protesting crowd dispersed. At K.K.Nagar, CPI (M) cadre attempted to picket Indian Bank. The police barricadedthe entire area.

The hardship suffered by the poor and the marginalised, middle-class, farmers, fishermen, weavers and small traders, amongst others is unfathomable,” Mr. Karunanidhi said in a statement. Referring to the recent statement of Union Minister M. Venkaiah Naidu that rolling back something was not in Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s blood, the DMK chief said the BJP leader’s statement was adding fuel to the fire. Since the leaders of various political parties, which opposed demonetisation have called for an agitation in front of central government offices in all district headquarters on November 28, Mr. Karunanidhi urged his party cadre to take part in large numbers with the support of the general public to raise their voice against the anti-people decision of the BJP government.

753,2016-11-25,18.0,New Rs. 500 currency notes reach State,"The long wait for the new Rs. 500 notes has ended with their arrival in the city on Thursday. They will be available in towns and rural areas by the end of this week. The banks will dispatch them to branches depending upon the demand. “We are trying to send them to selected chests and branches in the State,” said a senior official of a public sector bank. The Reserve Bank dispatched a mere Rs. 25 crore worth Rs. 500 notes to Andhra Pradesh. The Andhra Bank, SBI, Bank of Baroda (BOB) and the Syndicate Bank etc received Rs. 1.5 crore each. There are no signs of receiving further dispatches before Monday. The bankers are expecting another Rs. 28 crore by Tuesday, said an official. Chief Minister N. Chandrababu Naidu urged the Centre to dispatch Rs. 1000 crore worth smaller denomination notes such as Rs. 100, Rs. 50, Rs. 20 and Rs.10. The government expected that the RBI would dispatch at least Rs. 50 crore worth Rs. 500 notes initially. Joy of Rs. 500 note Meanwhile, the arrival of Rs 500 notes has sent the excitement levels soaring among Vijayawada people. The excitement, however, vanished into thin air within no time as the ATMs had run out of the notes. Only those customers who could make it to the ATMs as soon as replenishment could garner a few notes. The notes are expected to help streamline the market following the demonetisation of the old high-value notes. The smaller denomination notes in circulation in the State are not sufficient hampering the economic activity as people do not have cash to purchase things. Many are also not willing to take Rs. 2000 notes in view of the shortage of the smaller denomination notes. The situation may ease a little only if there are further dispatches. “The banks have been managing with all the resources they have had these days,” said a banker.

757,2016-11-25,18.0,Demonetisation: transport sector too skids,"The effects of demonetisation are felt in the public transport system too. The number of persons travelling by buses has dropped, giving a tough time for transport officials, who are now witnessing a fall in revenue. An official of the Vellore region of Tamil Nadu State Transport Corporation (TNSTC) (Villupuram) Limited said that the revenue has gone down by at least 15 per cent. TNSTC, Vellore, operates 745 buses, including town buses. These buses ply to places including Chennai, Salem, Tiruchi, Villupuram and Bengaluru. “We are now facing a reduction in collection. Our daily earning, on an average, is around Rs. 70 lakh. There is a decline of about 15 per cent in revenue since demonetisation was announced,” the official said. Another official said the withdrawal of the two high denomination notes of Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,000 has hit markets and businesses. “Likewise, it has affected public transport too. People either do not have sufficient money or lack lower denomination currencies. If they give Rs. 2,000 for a Rs. 100 ticket fare, where will our conductors go for change?” he asked. A crew member of TNSTC also said the number of commuters has come down in the last two weeks. “Some of them pay using the old Rs. 500 note but conductors do not have change,” he added. Private buses too face a similar problem. D. Vijaya Govindarajan, president of Vellore District Bus Owners Association, said passenger flow was low, resulting in dull days for private buses. There are nearly 300 buses that ply to various places within the district and neighbouring districts of Kancheepuram and Tiruvannamalai. “Public movement is low since demonetisation was declared. So, passenger flow has reduced by 20 to 25 per cent. Our revenue has also dropped by 20 to 25 per cent,” he said.

Balaraju. He said there were no banks in many mandals in Visakha Agency and ATM facility was available only at Chintapalli, between Sileru and Narsipatnam. These ATMs do not function regularly due to various reasons. While this is the situation regarding infrastructure the Girijans are not able to exchange the old Rs. 500 notes at ration shop, bus, medical shop or a hospital, he said. Traders are not participating in the weekly shandies. Girijans were also not told about demonetisation and it was a shock for them when the shopkeepers and others refused to accept the Rs. 500 notes. There is more trouble in store for Girijans as they bring their farm products like pulses, coffee and Rjama seeds to the market and are not sure of selling them, he said and warned of the Girijans falling prey to the middlemen as they are certain to exploit the situation.

759,2016-11-25,18.0,From currency chest to landfill,"What happens to the demonetised Rs.500 and Rs.1,000 notes? Where do they go from bank branches, many of which over the last fortnight have seen an incessant rush of people to deposit/exchange the notes? Notes to be shredded Like in the case of mutilated notes, they too will be shredded. Once cut into small pieces, they would be dumped in land fills, according to an RBI spokesperson. The central bank stopped incineration of the notes about 15 years ago, she said. The shreds, sources in the banking industry said, were compressed into briquettes. Sometimes, they are recycled and also used to make souvenirs. RBI, however, seems to be preferring to take the old notes to the dump yards. The shredding would be done at different offices of the RBI in the country, including Hyderabad, that are equipped with currency verification and processing systems (CVPS) . The CVPS at the Mumbai office was inaugurated in February 2003 and then RBI said that 42 such systems had been installed in its various offices to supplement the manual processing of notes. Each CVPS is capable of handling 50,000 - 60,000 notes per hour, a process that involves counting, examining their genuineness and sorting them into fit and unfit notes besides destroying the unfit ones on-line. The system sends the shreds to a separate briquetting system where they are compressed into briquettes of small size. The briquettes can be used as residual fuel in industrial furnaces. They can even be used for land fillings or for making items for use at offices and homes, according to RBI. Bids invited While inviting bids from manufacturers for supply, installation and commissioning of banknote shredding and briquetting system for its various offices, a list in which Hyderabad figured, the bank said the system should be capable of destroying soiled and cancelled bank notes by shredding/granulating and briquetting process. Their capacity should be between 150 and 175 kg. per hour. “The shredded pieces shall be such that at least 90 per cent shreds by weight shall pass through a sieve of 6 mm and no shredded piece shall be larger than 8 mm,” the tender said.

760,2016-11-25,18.0,Rs. 10 lakh in demonetised currency seized at airport,"In what is considered to be an indication of the influx of withdrawn Indian currency back to the country in the wake of demonetisation of high-value notes, the Customs Air Intelligence Unit foiled a smuggling attempt and seized Rs.10 lakh in the withdrawn denominations of Rs.500 and Rs.1,000 at the Cochin International Airport on Thursday. Abdul Salam of Panoor in Kannur district was nabbed on his arrival from Dubai on Thursday around 9 a.m. Addressing a press conference, Customs Commissioner K.N. Raghavan said the undeclared money had become worthless abroad owing to demonetisation. The arrested person was only a carrier who had reportedly agreed to do the job for a commission of Rs.20,000. He was intercepted by the Air Intelligence officers during baggage checking. The notes were found concealed in a napkin package, tissue paper boxes, and soap powder boxes. There was Rs.7 lakh in Rs.1,000 currency notes and Rs.3 lakh in Rs.500 notes. Salam had left for Dubai from the Kozhikode airport on November 20. The verification of his passport revealed that he was a frequent traveller to Dubai. Though he had never been caught before, Customs officials suspect that he had been active in smuggling activities. The officials also suspect the role of hawala channels behind the currency smuggling. The arrested person allegedly confessed that he had been asked to carry the consignment and hand it over to a person who would contact him outside the airport. Name revealed He is learnt to have revealed the name of the person who was supposed to receive the consignment. Customs officials said even though the government had ordered foreign exchange agencies abroad to stop accepting withdrawn currency, it is learnt that some agencies are still accepting the notes at a 20 per cent reduced exchange rate. These notes are later sent to India to be exchanged for new notes. “We are interrogating the accused to extract information about other people involved in the activities,” Mr. Raghavan said. The Customs Department has alerted the Reserve Bank of India, Income Tax Department, and the Enforcement Directorate to the seizure. The department has also registered a case against Salam for carrying money above the permissible limit. A passenger arriving from abroad should make a declaration at the airport if the amount he possesses exceeds Rs25,000. We are interrogating the accused to extract information about other people involved in the activities. K.N.

761,2016-11-25,18.0,Demonetisation crisis: start-ups make hay,"Start-ups have their hands full in the wake of demonetisation. While some are developing products that can address issues faced by people to a certain extent, the others are coming up with innovative payment methods and offers to not just retain the customer base but also to increase it. Incubated in T-Hub is a start-up that has developed a portal that was born to reduce the inconvenience faced by the people standing in long queues outside banks for depositing, withdrawing or exchanging currency. The team of Loan Yatra has developed www.bankQ.in as a philanthropic activity. “We came up with a solution of booking a slot in all the branches of all the banks in India. This would allow people to book a prior appointment and on that specific day, the user would go to the bank and carry out the required transaction. We made sure that the solution we have created is available to a common man even for those having key pad dialling mobile too with no internet using an IVR system,” said Vijayananda Reddy Kalluru, founder of Loan Yatra. An engineering innovations company, Express Bike Works promises to wash the dirtiest of the motorcycles under five minutes. With a busy centre in Kothaguda in the city, the company has rolled out a tempting offer to bring customers in to the fold of an online payment mode. Those who are making payment through Paytm will be charged only Rs. 10 for their first bike wash instead of the regular price of Rs. 200. “Our customers are mostly middle-income group. There was apprehension among them after the government’s decision of demonetisation. Since we wanted them to get used to the online payment mode, we came out with this offer,” said Niraj Taksande, co-founder of Entropy Innovations. For some start-ups, severe shortage of currency notes has also helped in improving their business. The Hyderabad-based Anytime Loan, a peer-to-peer lending platform, has seen a 35per cent jump in the last 20 days. K.K. Jain of Anytime Loans said that the borrowers and lenders were increasingly doing business online.

  Demonetisation of currency notes will completely destabilise the economy as it comes on close heels of the goods and services tax (GST) implementation, West Bengal finance minister Amit Mitra said here. “Demonetisation will be a double whammy for the poor,” Mr. Mitra said. “It will completely destabilise and disrupt the entire process of economic activity and the GDP (Gross Domestic Product) will collapse. With GST, there is a destabilisation already underway. That is why the states are being compensated for five years for losses arising out of the transition under the GST.” Mr. Mitra said while the circulation of counterfeit currency notes in the economy was estimated to be about Rs.400 crore in 2014 “according to government’s own intelligence unit,” the demonetisation exercise will cost Rs.14.5 lakh crore to the economy. “Is this move for combating black money or is there a hidden agenda?” the West Bengal finance minister asked.

763,2016-11-26,19.0,Demonetisation: Hotel industry earnings drop by 50 per cent,"The daily revenue of hotels and restaurants has dropped by 50 to 60 per cent post demonetisation in Mysuru. Hit by currency crunch, the number of people going to restaurants has declined largely and the hotel industry here feels that the situation is unlikely to improve at least till mid-December. Continual fall The hospitality sector’s earning had seen a continual fall since September, barring a short period in October. Tourist footfall had seen a drastic decline in September following the Cauvery agitation. In that month, the revenue had fallen by more than 50 per cent with a fall in tourist arrivals, as protests had taken centre stage in the Bengaluru-Mysuru corridor. The Cauvery row cast a shadow on the Dasara festivities in October, causing revenue loss to the sector with drop in tourists. Dasara is the time when the hospitality sector hopes to earn good revenue. Mysuru Hotel Owners’ Association president Narayana Gowda told The Hindu that daily earnings of hotels, restaurants, sweet shops, and bakery sector had fallen from Rs. 1.5 crore to Rs. 60 lakh since demonetisation. No dip in costs Despite the fall in revenue, the costs involved in running hotels and restaurants has remained the same. “We have no option but to meet the expenses despite the fall in our income,” Mr. Gowda explained. “How can a restaurant give change for Rs. 2,000 for a bill of Rs. 200,” he asked. Most restaurants have put up boards urging customers to cooperate with them and provide change. “We cannot leave a customer because of change problem. How long can we give the reason of change problem since we are here to do business and earn our livelihood. We are doing our best to mobilise change to meet daily needs,” Mr. Gowda said. The association has resolved to pay salaries of workers in the industry in cheque to tide over the cash crisis.

765,2016-11-26,19.0,"Demonetisation has eroded people?s confidence in currency, banking system: Kharge","Former Union Minister and Leader of the Congress in Lok Sabha M. Mallikarjun Kharge has charged the ruling BJP-led NDA government at the Centre of eroding confidence of the people in the currency and banking activities through its flip flop actions after demonetisation of Rs. 500 and Rs. 1000 notes. Speaking to media representatives in Kalaburagi on Saturday, Mr. Kharge said that Union government’s changing stance on the demonetisation and the exchange of the demonetised notes in banks and restrictions on the withdrawal of taxed cash from individual accounts had eroded the confidence of the people in the currency. Taking a dig at Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s repeated statement of cashless transaction and use of mobile for all transactions, Mr. Kharge pointed out that the currency continued to rule the roost and the online transaction was limited to certain sector even in the developed countries like USA and the European Union countries. Mr. Kharge said in India majority of the transaction is done through cash, more particularly so in the rural areas and small cities and towns and only a small population living the metros and big cities use the cashless transaction facility. On the controversial statement of Prime Minister that those opposed to demonetisation were supporting the black money, Mr Kharge said that Mr. Modi was not speaking like a statesman. “Even Supreme Court has made severe strictures and critical observations about the way the demonetisation was handled by the Union government. Does this mean that even the apex court is also anti-national and supporting black money? Misrepresenting the facts and spreading falsehood and branding all those who oppose his decision of demonetisation as the supporters of black money holders is wrong? Mr. Kharge said. Mr. Kharge said that Prime Minister should not consider himself as paragon of virtues and owes an explanation to the people on how those close to him acquired properties worth several crores overnight days before the demonetisation. “The PM should also explain how crores of rupees were deposited in the accounts of the BJP in Kolkota prior to the demonetisation. He should tell the nation who leaked the information about demonetisation to them.” Mr. Kharge wondered why Mr. Modi was shying away from the Parliament and speaking everything outside the parliament when the house was in session. “Mr. Modi is obviously afraid to face the parliament and has no valid explanation to the points raised by the opposition parties.” To a question, Mr. Kharge said that no Bharat Bandh has been called on November 28 against the demonetisation issue by the opposition parties and the day would be observed as Äkrosh Divas with the opposition parties holding different forms of protests throughout the country in all the district headquarters, state capitals and at New Delhi.

  Though the left parties are a part of the seemingly united opposition to the demonetisation undertaken by the Centre, the Communist Party of India (Marxist) will not support the demand to roll-back the initiative. Talking to reporters during an interaction on Saturday, Sitaram Yechury, General Secretary of CPI(M) said a roll back of the announcements and slew of restrictions will stop even the possibility of eliminating the 2 or 3 per cent of stacked ‘black’ money. “Our concern is the people, whose economic activities and livelihood have been stalled due to the announcements. We want old notes to be exchanged and used in a wider variety of activities,” he said. On November 28, numerous opposition parties including the left parties, Trinamool National Congress, Indian National Congress have called for an “Akrosh Divas” (a day of anger) to express the inability of the Centre to restore economic activity after nearly 85 per cent of the country’s cash was scrapped. When asked if this would further inconvenience the public, Mr. Yechury said: “This is a call for protest action, not a bandh. The opposition will march separately, but strike together. Our point is to redress the anger of the people. It is demonetisation that has seen a bandh-like situation as economic activities have come to a standstill.” The protest action was also to pressure Prime Minister Narendra Modi to address parliamentarians. “If he continues to remain silent (after November 28), the opposition parties will have to think seriously,” he said. With distress spreading across the economic landscape, particularly in rural areas, the CPI(M) leader said the constant flip-flops, exemptions and barrage of notifications compounded the absurdity of demonetisation. “Farmers are selling crops in distress. The government believes that allowing old notes to buy seeds is a solution. But anyone familiar with agriculture, knows that farmers do not buy just from government outlet. They buy even from fellow farmers in a form of barter or cash transactions,” he said. The demonetisation initiative has failed in all its four objectives (eradicating black money, reducing corruption, terror financing and putting an end to counterfeiting) and this failure would reflect in the upcoming Uttar Pradesh Assembly polls, said Mr. Yechury.

767,2016-11-26,19.0,"Demonetisation a 'draconian? step, says Greek minister","Greece considered several measures to prevent black money, but never anything as ""draconian"" as the Indian government's demonetisation move, says visiting Greek Alternate (or Deputy) Minister of Foreign Affairs George Katrougalos in an exclusive interview to The Hindu. Katrougalos, who was formerly Labour minister, also spoke on the Trump effect on global trade, and Greece's support to India for the Nuclear Suppliers Group. Expressing optimism about the future of the Left parties, he said a majority of people believe that neo-liberal policies favour just one percent of the population. The rise of the Right is clear proof that the status quo is not defendable, he said, adding that, when the vacuum is filled by the Right with the rhetoric favouring anti-elite positions, ""we see a Trump win, or the rise of the nationalistic forces in Europe. But the Left also has the chance to fill this vacuum, which is what happened in Greece and Portugal."" (Edited excerpts) Given that India and Greece have not had very close ties in the recent past, where do you think the broadest bilateral opportunities for cooperation now lie? We represent ancient civilisations that have always had contact, but it is true that we have a lot to do. On economic issues, we are starting from a relatively low level and this presents an opportunity to improve. India is an economic superpower and we are a country just getting out of a crisis. So there is an opportunity for India to invest in Greece as we have become very affordable in areas such as infrastructure, energy including renewable, information technology and tourism. New direct flights started recently will also help. I have met my counterpart Mr. M.J Akbar and invited him to return the visit, and hope for our foreign minister and Prime Minister to visit in the future. Multilaterally, India is keen to push its membership for the Nuclear Suppliers Group, of which Greece is a member. Did this come up in talks, and where do you see India’s application going? We are going to support India’s demand, because you have an unblemished record towards non-proliferation of nuclear technology. India’s responsible approach must be recognised, and Greece will be supportive, and we hope the overall climate will be favourable. Where is the application stuck then? Many countries have offered support, so who is still blocking it? There were discussions on this on November 11th. It will be discussed in future and I think India will succeed. It is a question of when and not if, but I cannot say that it will happen this year. You are in India when the burning issue is over the government’s demonetisation exercise. Do you think it was the best way to prevent black money and corruption? We have similar problems in Greece with regard to black money and the grey economy. Also in the European Union (EU), we have had discussions over what to do with the 500 Euro note. We have taken some measures in Greece, not as draconian as yours (the Indian government’s). For instance, we have said those depositing cash in banks must disclose their identity and other necessary details. However, as someone coming from another country, it is hard for me to have a critical stand without an understanding of the local issues (in India). As I told you, we have not adopted such draconian policies, and I am not fully aware of the situation that you have had to face here, so it would be irresponsible to make comments on the situation. We ourselves are trying to track this (black) money. Those in the grey market and carrying out illegal activities, use this money. In Greece, we have taken many actions to monitor it. We also have a problem in Greece of the “black labour market”, and we are working with international organisations on this as well. Greece had relied heavily on external debt to improve its economy, but failed in the process. What are the lessons there for India as its external debt to GDP ratio has increased to 23 per cent now from 17 per cent a decade ago? Is India in danger of shocks due to its rising external debt? The two situations cannot be compared. Well, we did learn a lesson on that (external debt) in our dealings with the EU. It is that we cannot change Greece alone. We have to make the necessary changes in Europe as well. We tried to implement a pro-socialist approach in Greece, and because of the domination of austerity policies in Europe, this has not worked. So now we are trying to influence the long term policies in the EU -- to promote cooperation of leaders who share our viewpoint that for the future of Europe we must work against austerity approach. Also socialist democratic movements and movements to the Left must work closer on our common agendas. But across the world, it is the right-wing parties that are winning elections -- like in the US. What do you think will be the impact on global trade and investment? Interestingly, even when we have the rise of the right-wing forces, their discourse is critical of the elite. In the US, on whether they think the government has done enough for the working class, the answer from Republican and Democrat voters saw 67 per cent on each side saying no. So I am optimistic about the future of the Left parties as the majority -- without reference to specific political beliefs like the Trump and anti-Trump voters -- believe that neo-liberal policies favour just one percent of the population. And that’s why the rhetoric of the right-wing favours these anti-elite positions. In Europe it is similar, which explains why trust in national parliaments and the EU are at historic lows between 27-33 per cent. Are you saying right wing electoral wins across the world actually represent a leftward movement? No. What I am saying is that they are responding to an objective situation, which is why I am optimistic. The rise of the Right is clear proof that the status quo is not defendable. It can be defeated either by the Left or by the Right. So when the vacuum is filled by the Right then we see a Trump win, or the rise of the nationalistic forces in Europe. But the Left also has the chance to fill this vacuum, which is what happened in Greece and Portugal. In Europe, the parallel to the post World War-I scenario is there, when politicians found Jews as a scapegoat. Now they make immigrants and refugees the scapegoat. Responding to anti-immigrant sentiments in matters of global trade, India says immigration should not be mixed up with movement of skilled workers overseas for short-term projects. What is Greece’s stand on India’s demand to ensure easy temporary movement of such people for work across the globe? Greece has the opposite problem, which is that because of this freedom of movement in the EU, we have seen a brain-drain of about 300,000 of our young professionals leaving. Our primary concern is to re-attract younger Greeks to return. On your question, we are for free trade and free movement in general terms. GMR Group is bidding to develop an international airport in Greece. How do you rate their chances, and how are you pitching for more Indian investment? By ensuring political stability, we have met the basic requirement of attracting investment. For economic stability, something that every investor wants, we now have a new stable tax system. We also have a new law to remove red tape for investment. We also have tax incentives, and have created special agencies to facilitate investments. Indian investors should choose Greece for all these reasons, and also because we can act as a bridge between Asia and Europe as well as Africa. After the crisis, we lost more than one fourth of our GDP. So at all levels, we are much cheaper than in the past. For country like India that is thinking globally, Greece is a really good place to do business. India is planning to build over 100 smart cities. Is Greece looking at participating in building smart cities in India? Greece has developed good IT companies. These cities need not be capital intensive. What is important is that they use human capital smartly. Also, clean energy is an area that has potential for bilateral cooperation. Given the similarities in manpower capabilities and push for manufacturing, do you think there will be more potential for rivalry between our nations? No. There are many commonalities, and exchanges of these capabilities are better than rivalry. Do you think India-Greece ties have taken a back seat because of lack of progress in the proposed India-EU free trade agreement negotiations? Like the UK, do you feel bilateral ties with India is not progressing well due to the EU factor? No. Being in the EU has helped us improve our relations with other countries. The EU’s remained an economic project, and problems started when political integration was not happening at the same pace as the economic integration. Also, after the recent austerity policies, the new generation began feeling that they might have a worse future than their parents. Therefore, to ensure political legitimacy, the EU must have a greater democratic process where there is more active involvement of its citizens. Following Brexit, the world was worried about ‘Grexit’ (Greece exiting the EU). Are you saying it won’t happen? What I am saying is that to the extent that the EU is following austerity policies, it is creating existential problems for its future. European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker termed his team as the ‘last-chance Commission.’ But I consider it his ignorance of the dynamics of the EU. By itself, the process of unifying the EU for economic cooperation is noble. But it can be successful only if responds to the actual needs of its citizens. That is what is before the democratic representatives of the European people. We do not like the actual state of the EU, but we decided that the best policy was not to leave the EU, but to try to change it to suit the needs of its people. For the first time since 2014, the Greece economy recently registered quarterly growth. Do you think Greece will be able to sustain this performance? What are the challenges there given that Greece is depending on financial aid from the IMF? International organisations forecast a GDP growth of 2.7 in 2017. We need to sustain this growth and ensure that it is inclusive. Almost a third of our citizens are near the poverty threshold. This is the worst in the EU. We have seen improvement though. During our administration, there was a reduction in unemployment. But still a lot of our youth are unemployed even after the brain drain. The question of IMF aid is important. We had a huge debt. But despite the austerity measures and the consequent suffering, the public debt to GDP ratio has ballooned from 128 per cent in 2010 to 180 per cent currently. We have negotiated possible measures to alleviate this debt because it is unsustainable and clearly a burden for the future of Greece. So we hope that now that we have fully respected our obligations in the framework of the (bailout) programmes, it is time for our partners to help in positive measures. In this, we have the IMF’s support. We do not share the views of the IMF in other areas of reforms including labour reforms. We are fully for reforms, but we want workers rights to be respected as well. In a post-Trump, post-Brexit and post-inward looking government era, clearly the West is changing. Do you think there will be that flexibility towards Greece’s problems and the kind of welfare state that you have advocated? The answer is never in isolation. We are looking at a Trump era. But it is also a Bernie Sanders era. We had for the first time a change of agenda for the Democratic party in the US. The main failure of Hillary Clinton's candidature was that she focused more on identity issues and not on most of the global issues including poverty and inclusion – in both white and non-white regions. In the EU, we have now debate between pro-austerity and a socialism. Earlier, we did not have this problem of nationalism being promoted by the right-wingers. When we speak about sovereignty, now we are not speaking about popular sovereignty based on the will of the people as we know after the French revolution. We speak about the idea of blood and soil. Fascism and Nazism were born due to the frustration of the middle class, and because the answers were not to face the real problems of the crisis they found a scapegoat in Jews. Now also these are the challenges due to the increase in inequality. It is there in South Africa, which saw a miracle of political emancipation. In Brazil too there is inequality. So everywhere we are facing, as always, a confrontation between the forces of capital and forces of labour. This is clear in the EU as well.

768,2016-11-26,19.0,Kozhikode limps to normalcy as currency crunch tapers,"Busy hours: People stand in a queue in front of a counter at a public sector bank in Kozhikode on Friday.
  Normalcy has returned to urban areas in the district almost three weeks after the Centre demonetised high-value notes. However, there is no end to rush at scheduled commercial banks, many of which functioned till late in the evening on Friday. Banks will remain closed on Saturday and Sunday. Even though they have been exempted from the dawn-to-dusk hartal on Monday, services are likely to be hit. Meanwhile, long queues have almost disappeared from ATM counters, with most machines dispensing only Rs.2,000 notes. The situation is likely to stabilise in a couple of days, bankers said. Lead Bank Manager (Kozhikode) K. Bhuvanadas said 60 per cent of ATMs across the district had been recalibrated for dispensing Rs.500 and Rs.2,000 notes. “People are hoarding cash as a result of which there is no transaction in the market. This has led to shortage of cash,” he said. The district has around 400 ATMs of all leading nationalised and commercial banks. “Most banks have enough cash for customers. However, no data is available on the currency chest with banks and dispensation of cash at each branch. Some banks handle over Rs.30 lakh a day,” Mr. Bhuvanadas added. On the other hand, rural areas are the worst hit, thanks to shortage of currency notes. However, the situation has improved since the Centre stopped the over-the-counter exchange of defunct currency notes. The decision to extend the use of Rs.500 notes for public utility services till December 15 has been a huge relief to people. Meanwhile, banking services have almost come to a standstill in the cooperative sector. Primary cooperative banks and cooperative societies that do not come under the Banking Regulation Act wore a deserted look on Friday after the RBI imposed stringent regulations on their functioning.

770,2016-11-26,19.0,Demonetised currency pushing beedi workers into debt," Beedi industry, which provides employment to several lakhs of womenfolk in entire Telangana in general and Rajanna-Sircilla district in particular is slowly entering into a crisis following the demonetization of high currency notes. The rolling of beedis is an alternate source of employment to the womenfolk in the Sircilla textile town and it provides additional household income. But, since the announcement of demonetization, the womenfolk were unable to get their wages following the banning of high denominations. The beedi workers are being offered devalued Rs 1000 and Rs 500 notes for their wages, which the beedi rolling women are refusing to accept as they cannot exchange it in the market. Since the demonetisation announcement on November 8, the beedi workers have not received their wages. Sumalatha, a beedi worker in Baddam Yellareddynagar of Sircilla textile town says that she was borrowing for the buying household provisions and payment of school fees due to non-availability of wages for rolling beedis since last two weeks. “The beedi companies are paying old currency notes as wages, but we are not not ready to accept them as we cannot exchange them and we don’t even have bank accounts,” she said. Rajitha, another beedi worker and widow, said that it has become a herculean task for her to run the family without wages for rolling beedis. “Why should poor people undergo hardships when only some big people were making black money,” she asked. Shankar, a commission agent (tekedhar), said that he was likely to lose his wages as the womenfolk have stopped procuring the tendu leaves and tobacco for rolling beedies as they were not being paid wages. He said that his sole earning was a commission of Rs 10 per every 1000 beedis he collects from these women. CITU leader Pantham Ravi said that the demonetization is likely to create unrest among the labour force in this textile town. Neither the beedi workers nor the powerloom workers were getting the wages following the demonetization, he said and feared that the distressed powerloom weavers might resort to suicide as they were being forced to borrow from private micro finance companies for their essential expenses and the debt was mounting.

771,2016-11-26,19.0,Demonetisation is a draconian move: Greek Minister,"Greece and the European Union implemented many measures to counter black money and the “grey economy,” but nothing so “draconian” or drastic as the Indian government’s demonetisation exercise, Greek Minister George Katrougalos has said. Mr. Katrougalos, who is on an official visit, said that both the EU and Greece had, like India, discussed the issue of unaccounted wealth as well as the possibility of demonetising the high-value €500 note. “We have taken some measures in Greece, not as draconian as yours [the Indian government’s]. For instance, anybody who goes to bank to deposit cash must give his name and financial records. So, we are trying ourselves to track this money,” the alternate or deputy Foreign Minister told The Hindu in an exclusive interview. However, Mr. Katrougalos, who was formerly Labour Minister and is a senior member of the Syriza coalition that rules Greece, clarified that it was difficult to draw comparisons, or to speak about the Indian decision as an outsider. “We have not adopted such draconian policies, but I am not fully aware of the situation that you have had to face here.” Greece’s economy crashed following the 2008 global financial crisis, which led to a currency crunch that set off riots across the country. In 2015, Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras formed the radical left-wing Syriza government, agreeing to a slew of austerity measures stipulated by the IMF and European creditors (ECB and the European Commission), including tax increases and expenditure cuts. Eurozone crisis Mr. Katrougalos said the fact that Greece wiped out a quarter of its GDP during the Eurozone crisis meant it presented a “cheap” investment opportunity for Indian companies in infrastructure, energy, renewable energy and Information Technology. “Indian investors should choose Greece, also because we can act as a bridge between Asia and Europe and Africa. At all levels, we are much cheaper than in the past. For a country like India that is thinking globally, Greece is a really good place to do business,” said Mr. Katrougalos, who met Commerce Minister Nirmala Sitharaman and Minister of State for External Affairs M.J. Akbar. In a boost to India’s hopes for membership of the Nuclear Suppliers Group (NSG), he pledged Greece’s support as a member, but added that the process could take longer than what India had been pushing for. “There were discussions on this on November 11 [at the NSG meeting in Vienna]. It will be discussed in future, and I think India will succeed. It is a question of when and not if, but I cannot say it will happen this year,” Mr. Katrougalos said, adding that India’s “unblemished record” of non-proliferation must be recognised.

773,2016-11-26,19.0,Fracas mars SC hearing on demonetisation,"A Supreme Court Bench led by Chief Justice of India T.S. Thakur said on Friday that the judiciary will “certainly” hear the ground realities and weigh the constitutionality of the November 8 RBI notification scrapping the high-denomination currency notes. The court’s assurance came as random accusations of “maximum cash has gone into BJP hands” and “people are starving on the roads” overawed decorum at the hearing, with the Bench urging lawyers to maintain the dignity of the court. In a much-anticipated hearing on the demonetisation issue, the apex court said it would comprehensively hear arguments on various questions raised in the issue on December 2. These include the hardships caused by demonetisation, the transferring of petitions filed in the various High Courts to Delhi, whether these petitions should be heard by the Delhi High Court or the Supreme Court itself, the constitutional validity of the RBI notification of November 8, and finally, whether the issue should be referred to a Constitution Bench. In this, the Bench accepted the suggestion of the government that it was better to hear the demonetisation issue in its totality on December 2 rather than in a piecemeal fashion. Attorney-General Mukul Rohatgi submitted that the government's petition to transfer all demonetisation-related cases from other High Courts to the National Capital was already scheduled for hearing on December 2. In that case, the four separate petitions — listed today for hearing on Friday — should also be heard on the same day, Mr Rohatgi said, as this would ensure that the court takes an informed decision after considering all aspects of the issue. The morning’s hearing began with senior advocate Kapil Sibal, appearing for a petitioner, claiming that “people were starving on the roads.” “Nobody is starving on the roads,” Mr. Rohatgi said, dismissing the claim peremptorily. “The markets are closed,” Mr. Sibal shot another barb at the demonetisation exercise to weed out black money. At this point, advocate Manohar Lal Sharma, who claims that the new Rs. 2000 bank notes bleed easily and can be faked, wrested the floor from Mr. Sibal, claiming “all the banks are closed”. “Maximum cash has gone into BJP hands,” Mr. Sharma declared as shouts of protest erupted inside the court. Then lawyers vied with each other, raising their hands for the court's attention as pandemonium seemed imminent. Chief Justice Thakur, on the Bench along with Justice D.Y. Chandrachud, had maintained silence all through. But as the shouting continued, he Chief Justice reined in the confusion by issuing a stern warning that the court would adjourn the hearing by another six weeks unless order was restored immediately. “Everyone is shouting with their hands over the other's shoulder. This is a courtroom and there is some decorum to be observed here. We will adjourn the case for hearing after the vacation,” Chief Justice Thakur addressed the crowded courtroom. “There are some really serious issues here, My Lords,” Mr. Sibal interceded. “If there is a difficulty, you tell us what the problems are,” Chief Justice Thakur addressed the senior lawyer. “There is a lot of inconvenience. They don't have the capacity to print the new currency... what are they going to do?” Mr. Sibal said. “If you want us to look into it... We will certainly do... But we will hear all. We cannot hear this issue piecemeal,” Chief Justice Thakur said, refusing Mr. Sibal's plea to advance the hearing to next Tuesday.

774,2016-11-26,19.0,Demonetisation impacts gold loan schemes in Mandya district,"People waiting in along queue outside a bank to exchange or deposit their demonetised currency of Rs. 1,000 and Rs. 500 in Mandya on Friday.
  The demonetisation of Rs. 1,000 and Rs. 500 notes announced by the Centre on November 8 has left a tell-tale impact on the gold monetisation schemes (GMS) across the district. The demonetisation has paralysed the flourishing gold-loan business of pawn brokers completely, apart from forcing customers to stay away from banks following the weekly ceiling of Rs. 24,000 on cash withdrawals. “The number of customers and general public approaching banks seeking ‘loans for gold’ has fallen drastically owing to demonetisation, N.G. Prabhudev, manager, Lead Bank of Mandya (Vijaya Bank), told The Hindu here on Friday. The Kallahalli branch of Canara Bank, off the Bengaluru-Mysuru highway here, used to issue gold-loans to at least four people everyday. Nevertheless, only four have availed the facility since the announcement of ban on the circulation of two high-value notes, a senior officer at the bank said. Across Mandya According to officials at various major nationalised banks, the situation is not different at banks or branches at other places in all seven taluks. The district has 284 branches of 28 nationalised and private banks. On an average, the branches used to lend money to at least 2,200 persons everyday under the gold monetisation schemes (GMS). However, the number of beneficiaries under the GMS is less than 900 since the announcement of the demonetisation move. Weekly restrictions The cash withdrawal limit per person a week has been fixed at Rs. 24,000. The gold loan amount will be transferred to the individual’s bank account. Customers with savings bank (SB) accounts can withdraw Rs. 24,000 a week, while those who have current accounts (CA) are eligible to withdraw Rs. 50,000 a week. The response to GMS has significantly come down because of the restrictions on cash withdrawal, Mr. Prabhudev said. Pawn brokers Meanwhile, the business of pawn-brokers has come to a halt after the demonetisation, said sources from the Pawn Brokers Association. The district has over 700 pawn brokers and all of them have stopped lending gold-loans because of the non-availability of valid currency notes, Heeralal, a pawnbroker, said.

775,2016-11-26,19.0,Cash-driven ancillary units affected by demonetisation,"The impact of demonetisation on ancillary units in the unorganised sector is likely to have a cascading impact on registered manufacturing units in the long run. While there are no accurate records of the number of such units in Mysuru — since they are not registered and hence officially “illegal” — they are the backbone of medium and small scale units in the region as they provide services at throwaway rates. Sources in the industries told The Hindu that the bulk of such ancillary units raised funds through informal sources on a daily or weekly basis at a higher rate of interest. But their source and money supply had evaporated consequent to demonetisation. Though this is reckoned to be a temporary phase, the impact is beginning to be felt and will affect all manufacturing units in Mysuru, according to Suresh Kumar Jain, secretary, Mysore Industries Association. He said the units which flourished in the unorganised sector include printing, welding, lathe workshops, carpentry, electrical wiring, automobile repair shops, and food processing units where transaction is by cash and workers are paid daily. “With cash crunch extending for almost two weeks, daily wage workers are unable to sustain themselves. In addition, there is a withdrawal limit of Rs. 24,000 a week, which is inadequate for the entrepreneur,” Mr. Jain said. In the absence of registration, institutional finance by way of bank loans are not extended to such units and thus, the impact of demonetisation is greater on them. According to Sudhakar Shetty, vice-president, Federation of Karnataka Chamber of Commerce and Industries, there are not less than 12,000 MSME units in the unorganised sector in Mysuru district, employing nearly a lakh people at a conservative estimate. “Daily wagers are not paid in cheques and most have no accounts for money transfer. This transition period is very painful,” Mr. Shetty said. As many entrepreneurs in the micro units do not operate through banks, they do not have overdraft facility or cannot avail themselves of advances available for registered industries. Meanwhile, the MIA is trying to extend assistance to enable them to open bank accounts to bring them to mainstream. Medium and large scale units where payment is through cheques and electronic form have not been affected.

776,2016-11-26,19.0,?Demonetisation woes of fishermen will be taken to govt?s attention?,"The district administration would send a detailed report to the government on the difficulties faced by the fishermen in coastal areas of Kanniyakumari district due to demonetisation of Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,000 currency notes, Collector Sajjansingh R. Chavan said here on Friday. In reply to oral submissions made by the fishermen at the monthly grievances meeting, Mr. Chavan said the sentiments of the fishermen would be recorded in detail by officials and the report would be forwarded to the government. The fishermen who attended the meeting said they were unable to sell their catch. Even if they managed to sell their catch, buyers were not paying them in cash. They were unable to go for fishing due to the funds crunch, they claimed. When the fishermen complained that they were denied housing facilities under Green House Scheme, Assistant Director of Fisheries Rubert Jothi said the government had allocated 500 Green Houses for the fishermen in village panchayats across the State. A survey of houseless fishermen was undertaken by the department and the report was sent to the government. Only those who had individual pattas would be eligible to get the benefit under Green House Scheme, he said. Mr. Chavan said other fishermen could get housing facility under ‘Housing for All’ Scheme being implemented from the current financial year. The problems expressed by the fishermen on the division of individual pattas would also be taken to the notice of the government, he added. Biometric IDs The fishermen, headed by Kanniyakumari District Meen Thozhilalar Sangam secretary Antony, demanded that the biometric identity cards issued by the government should be routed through their association, and not through the officials. District Revenue Officer S. Elango, Deputy Director of Fisheries Lamac, and other officials also participated.

Two women died while standing in queues outside banks in Ballia and Muzaffarnagar, while a rickshaw-puller hanged himself to death after he learnt of the Centre’s decision to end over-the-counter exchange of now-defunct Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes for new ones at bank branches. The police said Indrasani Devi (70), who was standing for over three hours in a queue outside a Central Bank branch in Ratsad area of Ballia, suddenly fell ill. She died of cardiac arrest soon after. As the family did not have any cash for cremation of the body, the daughter-in-law of the deceased had to stand in queue at the same bank to withdraw money for it, they said. SP (Superintendent of Police) Vaibhav Krishna said the matter will be probed and necessary action will be taken against those found responsible. In Muzaffarnagar in western Uttar Pradesh, 85-year-old Murti Devi died while standing in a queue outside a PNB branch in Hanuman Chowk. The police said she had come to withdraw money from the bank. Meanwhile, a rickshaw-puller, Akbar (27), committed suicide by hanging himself at his house in Khurja, about 20km from Bulandshahr, after he learnt that the government has barred people without bank accounts from exchanging now-defunct Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes for new ones at bank branches. The government had on Thursday stopped over-the-counter exchange of defunct currency notes. The police said Akbar had four Rs 500 notes and he had tried to exchange them earlier but failed due to huge rush. On Thursday night, after hearing about the government’s decision, Akbar committed suicide, his wife said.

778,2016-11-26,19.0,Demonetisation makes auto ride dearer,"A drive in a three-wheeler has become much more expensive for citizens. Auto-rickshaw drivers are also complaining of dull business after Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced demonetisation of Rs. 500 and Rs. 1000. With very limited passengers stuffing their wallets with sufficient change, auto drivers find it tough to keep the wheels moving. While a majority of auto drivers confine themselves to picking up and dropping regular passengers and schoolchildren, for others it is dull business of late. While figuring out ways to deal with cash crunch is one part of the challenge, making use of high-denomination notes has become equally taxing. A few auto drivers find the situation quite tricky when they accept Rs.2,000 from customers. “When we try to pay higher denomination notes for commodities bought in the market or diesel refilled at fuel stations, they refuse to accept unless the value is equal or little less than Rs.2,000. This is forcing us to go for compulsive buying, leaving us cash-strapped in a few days,” said K. Shiva Kumar, auto-rickshaw driver at Siripuram junction. As a step to tide over change crisis, auto drivers said they were bound to ask their passengers to pay exact amount. “We make sure that the passengers carry enough change much before agreeing to ferry them. This will ensure hassle-free ride for us,” said Anand Babu, an auto-rickshaw driver at Maddilapalem. General secretary of Visakha Auto-rickshaw Workers Association (affiliated to CITU) D. Appalaraju said auto drivers suffered a bigger blow as finance companies refuse to accept high denomination notes for repayment of loans. Those who commute by autos complain that some of the drivers have started charging them double the normal fare. “On a normal day, share auto drivers charge Rs.5 to travel from Akkayyapalem to Gurudwara junction. But these days, they are demanding Rs.10,” laments M. Geetha, a sales girl. Cashing in on the cash crunch, commuters allege that auto drivers have rounded off the figures from Rs.60 to Rs.100 for the distance travelled from Seethammapeta to Jagadamba junction and other areas covering similar stretches.

779,2016-11-26,19.0,Demonetisation brings rural economy to a standstill,"Farming and allied agriculture business have come to a standstill in large parts of rural areas in the aftermath of the demonetisation, affecting the normal life of several farmers. Almost every branch of nationalised bank in rural areas across the district was seen overcrowded. On Friday, many farmers queued up for depositing demonetised currencies and for other transactions at the Indian Overseas Bank branch at Alathur Gate. One of the farmers, S. Pazhaniyandi (45) said that though he had been visiting and re-visiting the bank for the past three days to remit Rs. 30,000 towards part re-payment of a jewel loan, he could not do so in the wake of the large number of customers. Women customers were the worst hit. Revathy, an onion grower, said that she could not exchange the old Rs. 500 currency notes till now. “Being an agricultural labourer, I could not spend much time at the bank,” she said. Many Automated Teller Machines remained closed and are yet to be re-filled, forcing the customers to withdraw cash at the bank’s branch. Non-resident Indians too feel the pinch of demonetisation. M. S. Ali, a non-resident of Peralam village in Nagapattinam district, said that he could not withdraw his money for building a house. “I had come to my native place Peralam in Nagapattinam district for constructing a house. But, I am unable to withdraw cash in bulk,” he said.

Raising the issue at the Farmers Grievances meeting here, N. Ganesan, joint secretary, Tamil Nadu Milk Producers Welfare Association, said although the Tiruchi District Cooperative Milk Producers Union (Aavin) released the payments through banks, the cooperative milk producers societies in rural areas were unable to withdraw the money from the banks and disburse cash to producers as was the usual practice till now. “We used to withdraw cash from the society accounts and make the payments due to producers once every 15 days. Now, banks say that we can withdraw only Rs.12,000 a week,” Mr. Ganesan said. The District Central Cooperative Bank was unable to make direct transfers to the accounts of producers, he claimed. “The income from milk is vital for most farmers and the delay in payment has caused much hardship,” Mr. Ganesan said and urged the district administration to take steps to ensure that the payments were transferred to the accounts of the producers directly. Collector K. S. Palanisamy, who chaired the meet, instructed the Aavin officials to hold field-level meetings with the milk producers to find out their preferred mode of payment. If the sum was high, payments could be made by bank transfers to individual bank accounts of producers. Small amounts can be paid in cash, he said.

781,2016-11-26,19.0,Kozhikode limps to normalcy as currency crunch tapers,"Normalcy has returned to urban areas in the district almost three weeks after the Centre demonetised high-value notes. However, there is no end to rush at scheduled commercial banks, many of which functioned till late in the evening on Friday. Banks will remain closed on Saturday and Sunday. Even though they have been exempted from the dawn-to-dusk hartal on Monday, services are likely to be hit. Meanwhile, long queues have almost disappeared from ATM counters, with most machines dispensing only Rs.2,000 notes. The situation is likely to stabilise in a couple of days, bankers said. Lead Bank Manager (Kozhikode) K. Bhuvanadas said 60 per cent of ATMs across the district had been recalibrated for dispensing Rs.500 and Rs.2,000 notes. “People are hoarding cash as a result of which there is no transaction in the market. This has led to shortage of cash,” he said. The district has around 400 ATMs of all leading nationalised and commercial banks. “Most banks have enough cash for customers. However, no data is available on the currency chest with banks and dispensation of cash at each branch. Some banks handle over Rs.30 lakh a day,” Mr. Bhuvanadas added. On the other hand, rural areas are the worst hit, thanks to shortage of currency notes. However, the situation has improved since the Centre stopped the over-the-counter exchange of defunct currency notes. The decision to extend the use of Rs.500 notes for public utility services till December 15 has been a huge relief to people. Meanwhile, banking services have almost come to a standstill in the cooperative sector. Primary cooperative banks and cooperative societies that do not come under the Banking Regulation Act wore a deserted look on Friday after the RBI imposed stringent regulations on their functioning.

782,2016-11-26,19.0,CPI protests against currency crisis,"Cadre belonging to the Communist Party of India (CPI) on Friday staged demonstrations at 11 places across Puducherry and its suburbs protesting against the Centre’s decision to demonetise notes in the denomination of Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,000. Terming the decision as “unplanned”, R. Viswanathan, secretary of the CPI who led the demonstration in front of Corporation Bank at Indira Gandhi square, said the move had severely affected the common man. He said the Centre had failed to retrieve black money stashed in foreign countries. Instead of taking action against hoarders, the Centre had put common people in trouble. The sudden withdrawal of Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,000 notes had inconvenienced the people. The common man, especially daily wage workers, small vendors, and retail traders, had been severely affected and are unable to buy medicines and other essential commodities to meet their daily requirements, he said. At the agitation held at Thattanchavady, a section of CPI cadre raised slogans against the Union Government and laid a wreath on a non-functional ATM of a nationalised bank.

783,2016-11-26,19.0,Demonetisation impacts gold loan schemes in Mandya district,"The demonetisation of Rs. 1,000 and Rs. 500 notes announced by the Centre on November 8 has left a tell-tale impact on the gold monetisation schemes (GMS) across the district. The demonetisation has paralysed the flourishing gold-loan business of pawn brokers completely, apart from forcing customers to stay away from banks following the weekly ceiling of Rs. 24,000 on cash withdrawals. “The number of customers and general public approaching banks seeking loans for gold has fallen drastically owing to demonetisation, N.G. Prabhudev, manager, Lead Bank of Mandya (Vijaya Bank), told The Hindu here on Friday. The Kallahalli branch of Canara Bank, off the Bengaluru-Mysuru highway here, used to issue gold-loans to at least four people everyday. Nevertheless, only four have availed the facility since the announcement of ban on the circulation of two high-value notes, a senior officer at the bank said. Across Mandya According to officials at various major nationalised banks, the situation is not different at banks or branches at other places in all seven taluks. The district has 284 branches of 28 nationalised and private banks. On an average, the branches used to lend money to at least 2,200 persons everyday under the gold monetisation schemes (GMS). However, the number of beneficiaries under the GMS is less than 900 since the announcement of the demonetisation move. Weekly restrictions The cash withdrawal limit per person a week has been fixed at Rs. 24,000. The gold loan amount will be transferred to the individual’s bank account. Customers with savings bank (SB) accounts can withdraw Rs. 24,000 a week, while those who have current accounts (CA) are eligible to withdraw Rs. 50,000 a week. The response to GMS has significantly come down because of the restrictions on cash withdrawal, Mr. Prabhudev said. Pawn brokers Meanwhile, the business of pawn-brokers has come to a halt ever since the demonetisation, said sources from the Pawn Brokers Association. The district has over 700 pawn brokers and all of them have stopped lending gold-loans because of the non-availability of valid currency, Heeralal, a pawnbroker, said.

The federation will launch nation-wide protest action from November 29 against the government decision, said T. Narendran and S. S. Anil of the federation here in a press release on Thursday. The federation leaders said that it would take at least six months for the currency supply situation to normalise.

785,2016-11-26,19.0,Milk producers in HK region feel demonetisation heat,"With district central cooperative banks running short of valid currency caused by demonetisation of currency in the denomination of Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,000, coupled with the government-imposed limit on the amount of transactions in banks, over 41,000 small milk producers across the rural areas of Hyderabad Karnataka region are forced to manage their households without payment for the last two weeks. Though the Karnataka Cooperative Milk Producers’ Federation Ltd (KMF) is making payments to societies online as usual, the milk societies that procure milk at village level are unable to make weekly payments to milk suppliers. Kalaburagi Milk Union, under which Bidar, Kalaburagi and Yadgir districts fall, procures around 57,000 litres of milk a day from around 10,700 farmers and makes payments to milk suppliers on weekly basis. However, it could not make payments — about Rs. 1 crore a week — farmers for the last two weeks. “As per the Union government, a person or cooperative society can draw maximum of Rs. 24,000 a week. It is insufficient to make payments to all milk suppliers. The milk societies have therefore stopped payments to farmers for the last two weeks. I have been receiving a number of calls on the payment-related grievances and rushing to those places for redressing them,” Manohar Kulkarni, deputy manager, Kalaburagi Milk Union, told The Hindu on Friday. DCC bank officials were saying that the issue of currency shortage would hopefully be resolved by Monday, he said. Some milk societies that had adopted online mode of payment to their suppliers well before the demonetisation are at ease. But their number is too small. As per the information provided by KMF officials, of 355 functional milk cooperative societies under Kalaburagi Milk Union, only 15 have adopted online mode of payment. Upon the pressure from the Ballari Milk Union, which procures over 2 lakh litres of milk a day from around 30,500 milk farmers spread across 605 unions in Ballari, Koppal and Raichur district, Ballari DCC Bank has taken up an account opening drive among milk producers so as that it can disburse the payments online. “If all the milk producers have their back accounts in rural district cooperative bank, their payment can be made through online transfer. But, they have bank accounts in various nationalised banks and DCC banks don’t have facility of Real Time Gross Settlement. Upon our request, they have now started bank account opening drive among milk farmers so that they could make online payments within next two months,” Marulu Siddappa, Assistant Manager at Ballari Milk Union told The Hindu . In some societies, milk farmers without bank account are advised to open accounts so that their dues and future payments can be made online. ""Opening a bank account is a tiresome job for them as bank staff are busy with exchanging demonetised notes working overtime,"" said an officer. DCC banks plead helplessness in the matter. “Even if we have enough currency notes in the denomination of Rs. 100 or lesser denomination, we cannot allow milk cooperative societies to draw more than Rs. 24,000 a week as per the government directions,” Sidramareddy Patil, chairman of Kalaburagi DCC Bank, told The Hindu . If there were no restrictions, he added, there would be a good recovery of loans in the banks. KMF officials criticise the Union government for not exempting cooperative societies from restrictions of money transactions at banks. “At least now, the government should either exempt the cooperative societies from transaction restrictions or allow them to draw such amount of money that they require for clearing dues to milk suppliers every week,” Nagappa, an officer working with KMF in Bidar said.

Thirunavukkarasar has alleged that the Centre’s demonetisation of Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,000 notes has severely affected them. “Commercial units or industrialists do not seem to have been affected much by the announcement made by Prime Minister Modi. In a country where only about one per cent of the total population pays the income tax, about 90 per cent of the transactions are through cash,” he said in a statement. Against this background, announcing demonetisation and thereby curtailing circulation of 86 per cent of the cash of the poor and the middle-class had led to a pathetic situation with crores of people being forced to stand in long queues before banks and ATMs for exchanging their old notes, he said. “It doesn’t look like the BJP understands that 60 crore people in the country do not have bank accounts at all.” Referring to the proposed agitation called for by opposition parties against demonetisation on November 28, Mr. Thirunavukkarasar urged his party cadre to turn up in large numbers to protest against the “anti-people” policies of the BJP government. ‘It doesn’t look like the BJP understands that 60 crore people do not have bank accounts at all’ Printable version | Jan 7, 2017 1:35:38 AM | http://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/Poor-reeling-under-impact-of-demonetisation-TNCC-chief/article16724469.ece © The Hindu The cyclone wreaked havoc on the city throwing normal life out of gear.

Grievances “Likewise, there should be a common template for loan applications so that loan sanctioning could become faster. Presently, different banks were following various formats in the application forms, even though the contents have been almost the same”. These were some of the major grievances aired by the apparel manufacturers during a face-to-face programme organised between knitwear manufacturers and bank officials by the Tirupur Exporters Association on Thursday. Officials from as many as 36 commercial banks and credit rating agencies participated in the meeting. On the PCFC benefits, the Tirupur Exporters Association president Raja Shanmugam pointed out that the tool would come in handy in monetary situations like the one that had arisen soon after the Britain’s decision to exit from European Union. “At that time, there was an overnight steep fall in British Pound ”, he said. Bankers Club Mr. Shanmugam reiterated the need to revive the ‘Bankers Club’, which according to him, was once functioning in Tirupur cluster. “The said club comprising bank officials had been an informal platform to discuss the ways for improving credit flow in the cluster”, he said. The bank officials said the delays in sanctioning loans were mostly because the textile entrepreneurs failed to give all necessary documents in a single shot. Stressed assets Deepak Chheda, the banking committee member at TEA, said the stressed assets of Rs. 3,000 crore in Tirupur knitwear cluster was only an accumulated figure over past few decades and it was minuscule when compared to many huge loans that turned non-performing assets elsewhere in the country.

Channe Gowda, a resident of Salagame village in Hassan taluk, sells vegetables at the weekly market every Sunday. In the past three days, he has been seeing poor turnout at the market, which has had a direct impact on his earnings. “People do not have cash in hand. As Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,000 notes are no longer accepted, people have become cautious while spending,” he said. “I am told that in the future we have to carry card-swipe machines.

Similar is the response from Ismail, who sells farm tools. “I have watched experts speaking about cashless transactions. That may come into effect if people stop carrying cash. However, farmers, who are our customers, prefer cash. Many have never even used debit cards though they had got them after opening their bank accounts,” he said. He said he used to have business of Rs. 3,000 a day, but this Sunday he hardly earned Rs. 1,000. It is a similar story for the vegetable sellers.

The Centre has put a cap on daily withdrawal from the ATMs at Rs. 2,500. “If lakhs of railway men stand in the queue on December 1 for withdrawing money at the ATMs and banks, it will only add to the existing problem,” said Southern Railway Mazdoor Union general secretary N. Kannaiah. He said only the salaried class would be affected as their salary was deposited in banks. Traders carried out money transactions every day and had easy access to currencies of smaller values. “How does the government expect ‘running’ staff like me (a railway guard) to stand in queue for a whole day to withdraw money,” asked divisional secretary of Dakshin Railway Employees Union R. Sankaranarayanan. However, he was quick to add that the very demand for disbursement of entire salary in cash was only to put some pressure on the government. The union leaders said the payment of salary advance of Rs. 10,000 made on Thursday was only because of their demand. “Stop payment to banks” M. Nandasingh, national council member of All India Trade Union Congress (AITUC), said his organisation had urged the heads of all 21 transport corporations in the State to stop remittance of daily collections in banks. “The money of smaller denominations could be used to make salary payment to transport corporation employees,” he said. Stating that disbursement of salary through electronic clearance has been done only for the last eight years, he said the standing order of transport corporation was payment of salary in cash. Not possible However, a bank official said it was highly impossible to provide cash for entire salary of the Central Government and State Government employees in view of the cash crunch faced by the banks. “The ceiling on withdrawal of Rs. 24,000 a week stands good for all for the simple reason that we do not have cash. Besides, salary disbursement through cash will defeat the very idea of the Union Government to encourage transactions through banks,” he said.

According to officials, the meeting to be chaired by Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao would also discuss the measures to be taken to address problems arising out of the demonetisation of higher denomination currency notes. Revenue collection in the State, both tax revenue and non-tax revenue, has gone down drastically following the Centre's decision. It was stated that the revenue from commercial taxes, excise, registration and stamps, motor vehicles and others had taken a severe beating, although the Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation, other local bodies, and the Hyderabad Metro Water Supply & Sewerage Board had netted notable income as people were allowed to clear their dues in demonetised currency notes. As for their collections, the GHMC has netted over Rs.246 crore and gram panchayats about Rs. 51 crore. Two power distribution companies, the Hyderabad Metropolitan Development Authority and others have also collected some revenue, which otherwise would have been remained unpaid. Sources said the Cabinet meeting would focus on the steps to be taken to improve revenue from sectors such as real estate as it was linked to many other sectors. The meeting was also expected to zero in on the next Chief Secretary of the State as incumbent Rajiv Sharma will be demitting office on November 30. Five-member panel At a review meeting held with senior officials on Sunday, the Chief Minister observed that the Government could not remain a mute spectator to the situation arising out of the demonetisation. “There cannot be any stalemate in transactions since it concerns lakhs of people in the State,” he said. The Chief Minister constituted a five-member committee with senior IAS officers to work out modalities for preparing a policy towards cashless transactions (e-payment). The panel includes Principal Secretary Suresh Chanda, Secretaries Navin Mittal and Jayesh Ranjan and District Collectors M. Raghunandan Rao (Ranga Reddy) and Surendra Mohan (Suryapet). Secretary in the CMO A. Santi Kumari would represent the CMO on the committee. The Committee would prepare a job chart to the Collectors in the face of situations such as demonetisation. The Chief Minister asked the Chief Secretary to instruct the Collectors to involve bankers in making people move towards cashless transactions in future. He asked Finance Secretary K.

The demand and supply gap of smaller denomination currency notes was being constantly watched and measures being taken to overcome the same. Bankers were monitoring the demand position in the district and at the State-level the Chief Minister was personally reviewing the supply position from time to time, he told reporters here. The Collector said that ever since the demonetisation notification was issued meetings were being held with bankers at the mandal and district levels to avoid inconvenience to the people. The Chief Minister was also reviewing the situation through teleconference and video conference every day. An action plan was prepared for promoting cashless transactions by activating the existing bank/Jan Dhan accounts of pensioners, issuing and activation of RuPay cards, opening of new Jan Dhan accounts through banking correspondents and organisation of special campaigns to create awareness among people, especially those in the rural and tribal areas and in slums in the city. He said that there were 738 bank branches, 9.30 lakh Jan Dhan accounts and 37.26 lakh other accounts in the district. Of the Jan Dhan accounts, 6.70 lakh (72 per cent) and 27.76 lakh (75 per cent) of other accounts were seeded with Aadhar accounts. The total number of people, who have no bank accounts, was about seven lakh. The number of existing Point of Sale (PoS) machines available at merchant establishments was 6,101 and 563 new PoS machines were added since November 9. An additional 9,096 machines would be required in the district. He said that training modules were prepared at the district-level to educate the public on the use of mobile banking, Internet banking, RuPay cards, mobile apps and POS swiping machines. Special focus was being given to educate tribal people at the weekly shandies. The Collector said that a total of 6,109 PoS machines were functional in 10 departments in the district as against the requirement of 8,637. Measures were being taken to acquire more PoS machines. Mr. Pravin Kumar said that from December 1, Fair Price shops in the district would go for ‘cashless’ transactions and disbursal of pensions would also be in the same mode except in areas, where there was no network connectivity and in cases of pensioners, aged above 75 years of age, who were not in a position to visit bank branches. They would be paid through post offices and gram panchayats in the rural areas. Joint Collector G. Srijana was present. The facility of exchange of notes at banks and post offices was stopped with effect from November 24. Those who have Old High Denomination (OHD) notes of Rs.500 and Rs.1,000 with them have to deposit them in their bank accounts by December 30. The ceiling limit for the withdrawal of money from banks is Rs. 24,000 in a week, which could be withdrawn in three spells and the limit for withdrawal on a single day would be Rs.10,000.

Except black money holders, everyone is happy with demonetisation,” he said, adding that cancellation of high denomination notes did not affect the poor and the common man. It was shortage of small change that was pestering them at many places. “The issue will be addressed very soon. It is like a rebirth of our economy and we have to share the pangs initially,” he said.

The PIL filed by advocate Avinash Mani Tripathi, which is likely to come up for hearing before a bench later this week, alleges that there has been emergence of a “menace of converting black money into white through donation in cash” of “old high denomination notes of Rs. 500 and Rs. 1000 in the accounts of religious and charitable trusts running across the country”. The petitioner has contended that this would result in “failure” of government’s attempt to “eliminate black money” since donations made to religious institutions and trusts became a part of their income which was “exempt from tax”. The petitioner has also alleged “inaction on part of Government of India to make any declaration regarding monetary effect of specified bank notes received in donation box or directly at religious institutions or trusts”. It alleged that many of these were being “run by political leaders,” including those belonging to the ruling parties at the Centre and in the state. The petitioner has mentioned the names of institutions or trusts run by BJP MPs, an Uttar Pradesh cabinet minister, a former Union Minister from Congress and an AIMIM leader. The petitioner, who has named the Centre and the Reserve Bank of India as parties, has prayed for “directions to respondent authorities to declare that value of the old high denomination notes deposited in the accounts of religious institutions and trusts after November 08, 2016 would neither be credited nor exchanged”. As an interim measure, pending hearing on the PIL, the petitioner has prayed for directions for “constitution of a high-level committee for taking appropriate action against the menace of converting black money into white through donation in cash of old denomination notes in the accounts of religious institutions and trusts across the country”.

795,2016-11-27,20.0,Parties opposing demonetisation only to defame Modi: Bandaru,"Union Labour Minister Bandaru Dattatreya addressing the media in Tirupati on Saturday.  
| Photo Credit:  K_V_Poornachandra_Kumar TIRUPATI: Union Minister for Labour Bandaru Dattatreya has flayed the opposition parties for blindly opposing demonetisation only with the intention of defaming Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Addressing a media conference here on Saturday, Mr. Dattatreya called it a thoroughly planned exercise and not a ‘hasty decision’ as was being projected by a section of the political spectrum. “Only the Congress, Left and ‘some’ regional parties are opposing the decision for their own political ends, but 85 per cent of people have welcomed the move,” he said pointing to a survey. On migration to a cashless society, he expressed pain that educated politicians too preferred to play to the gallery by criticising the government, without appreciating the well-intended move. “Rahul Gandhi is an educated young leader. Though he knows the benefits of a cashless society, he is playing politics. Former Prime Minister and economist Manmohan Singh too resorts to shallow criticism instead of giving constructive suggestions to the government,” he said. “From Nehru to the recent PM, everybody had the vision and noble thought to eradicate corruption, but only Mr. Modi exhibited the will to act tough.” To a query on bringing the ill-gotten money stashed in banks abroad, Mr. Dattatreya observed that it required a three-pronged strategy, viz., ensuring tie-up with other countries, formulating a legal framework and forming a coordination body to oversee the operation. “Starting with Mauritius, we are in the process of making pacts.” As the Labour Minister, he announced that Jan Dhan accounts would be opened for the construction workers, domestic helps and workers employed in Anganwadi, ASHA and midday meal programmes to bring them into the ambit of banking. District level camps would be conducted to open accounts on a war-footing. Following the high-level understanding between the Ministries of Finance and Labour, the labour officials and the State-level bankers committee would sit together in the presence of the respective district Collectors and formulate ways to opening the accounts. This step is aimed at eliminating middlemen, delivering the benefits directly to the beneficiaries and also encouraging cashless transactions, he said. “Elimination of middlemen means eliminating black money.” BJP legislator and floor leader in Telangana Assembly Chintala Ramachandra Reddy was also present. Special Correspondent in Tirumala writes: Mr. Dattatreya termed the demonetisation move as a very courageous decision taken by Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Appreciating the measures being taken up by the temple administration in minimising the difficulties of the pilgrims post demonetisation, he said it was a matter of pride that the town had topped the list of 10 iconic places in the country and that the government also had released Rs.100 crores for taking up further developmental activities. Earlier Mr. Dattatreya accompanied by his newly married daughter and other family members had offered prayers to the presiding deity.

796,2016-11-27,20.0,Temples busy counting demonetisation bounty,"VIJAYAWADA: The government move to withdraw currency of Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,000 denominations has been impacting collections at temples as devotees are dumping the scrapped notes in hundis. A couple of days ago, the Machavaram Anjaneya Swamy temple officials were taken by surprise when they opened the hundi (collection box). They found the demonetised Rs. 1,000 and Rs. 500 notes' bundles along with a few notes of lesser denominations. They found 50 to 60 bundles of Rs 1,000 and Rs. 500 denomination currency. Temple executive officer N. V. Sambasiva Rao said that the temple usually receives about Rs. 3 lakh as hundi offerings from devotees in about two months. This was the first time the temple hundi collection crossed Rs. 1 crore, which was a quantum leap. Generally, there would be a jump in the offerings during festivals but definitely not at this magnitude, he observed. Another temple, Jaladeeswara shrine at Ghantasala, received Rs. 50 lakh a week ago. A major portion of this offering was Rs. 500 and Rs.1000 currency notes. Sri Durga Malleswara Swamyvarla Devasthanam, one of the major temples in the State, is also not lagging behind. The temple has been receiving lakhs of rupees in specified notes. The temple received Rs. 22.58 lakh in Rs. 1000 denomination by November 11 and another Rs. 56.25 lakh in Rs. 500 notes. In a subsequent collection on November 17, devotees deposited Rs. 6.83 lakh worth of Rs. 1000 currency notes and Rs. 22.34 lakh worth of Rs.500 currency notes. The trend continued on November 24 counting also. The temple received Rs. 601 notes of Rs.1000 and 2,681 notes of Rs. 500. Another Rs. 3.79 lakh worth Rs. 1000 and Rs.500 notes were deposited on November 25. The hundis fill up fast during festivals and auspicious occasions. The denominations of Rs 100, Rs 50, Rs 20 and Rs 10 and coins in the hundi are less compared to higher denomination currency. “It is definitely the fallout of the Central government's announcement of the demonetisation of high-value currency,” a staffer remarked.

798,2016-11-27,20.0,Kharge slams Union govt.on demonetisation,"The former Union Minister and Leader of the Congress in the Lok Sabha M. Mallikarjun Kharge has charged the National Democratic Alliance government with eroding confidence of the people in the Indian currency and banking activities through its flip flop after the demonetisation of currency in the denomination of Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,000. Speaking to presspersons on Saturday, he said that the Union government’s changing stance on the exchange of demonetised notes in banks and the restrictions on withdrawal of taxed cash from individual accounts had eroded the confidence of the people in the currency. Taking a dig at Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s repeated statements to go for cashless transactions and use mobile phones for transactions, Mr. Kharge pointed out that currency continued to rule the roost in most parts of the country and online transactions were limited to certain sectors even in developed countries. “In India, most of the transaction are through cash, more particularly so in rural areas, small cities and towns and only a minuscule population living in metros and big cities use cashless transaction through mobile phones and plastic cards.” On the Prime Minister’s statement that those who oppose demonetisation were supporting black money, Mr. Kharge said that Mr. Modi was not speaking like a statesman and his statement did not behove well with the position he occupies. “Even the Supreme Court has made severe strictures and critical observations about the way demonetisation was handled by the Union government. Does this mean that even the apex court is also anti-national and supporting black money? Misrepresenting facts and spreading falsehood and branding all those who oppose his decision of demonetisation as the supporters of black money holders is wrong,” Mr. Kharge said. He said that the Prime Minister should not consider himself as paragon of virtues and he owed an explanation to the people how people close to him acquired properties worth several crores overnight a couple of days prior to demonetisation. “Mr. Modi should also explain how crores of rupees were deposited in the accounts of the BJP in Kolkota prior to demonetisation. He should tell to the nation who leaked the information about demonetisation to them.” Mr. Kharge wondered why Mr. Modi was shying away from Parliament and speaking everything outside when the House was in session. “Mr. Modi is obviously afraid to face Parliament and has no valid explanation to the points raised by the Opposition parties.” To a question, Mr. Kharge said that ‘Bharat Bandh’ had not been called on November 28 by the Opposition and the day would be observed as Akrosh Divas. The Opposition parties would hold protests throughout the country at district headquarters, State capitals and in New Delhi.

The debate also threw light upon its possible benefits. Stating that some kind of incentive for taxpayers needs to be introduced, Dr. Charan Singh, professor, IIMB, said, “For those who do not pay taxes, exemplary punishment must be given.” Panellist V. Sridhar, Senior Deputy Editor, Frontline, said black money, which is laundered through multiple accounts, goes abroad and returns to India under the guise of foreign investment, and that is the greater danger. The panellists also underscored the importance of introducing more transparency into the system. “E-passbooks will be introduced in banking transactions shortly, where all properties will be attached, thereby bringing in more transparency,” said Chenraj Roychand, president, Jain University Trust. Though business may have been hit in the short term, the long-term benefits of the move were immense, he said. Dr. Mathew of Christ University, Dr. Abdul Aziz, Professor Emeritus, NLSU, Dr. Vivek Moorthy, professor, IIMB, and Dr. Salma Begum, professor, Bangalore University, also participated in the symposium.

The most recent violation was reported on November 25, when an inspector and his three sub-ordinates, all from the outer district, were accused of siphoning off Rs. 10 lakh from a man caught with Rs. 30 lakh in the banned currencies. The accused have been sent to the District Lines. On the sly Two days before that, a couple of FIRs were registered against seven policemen in similar cases. In one of the cases, four policemen allegedly forced a garbage collector to part with Rs.25 lakh of the Rs. 26.7 lakh that he had found at a dump yard. An inquiry has revealed that the accused — station house officer of the Jahangirpuri police station and his three junior colleagues — did not inform their seniors about the raid and tried to pocket the money themselves. In this case, too, the cash recovered was in the old notes. All four accused have been transferred. Man threatened In another case, an FIR was registered against three traffic police constables for allegedly attempting to rob a man of Rs. 1.2 lakh. The man was carrying the cash in the banned denominations and the policemen had allegedly threatened to implicate him in a criminal case. In a quandary Despite the complainant’s repeated requests that the money was meant for a wedding in his family, the constables had forced him to hand over the money to them. They had later returned the cash. Talking to The Hindu, a senior police officer, however, said it was too early to link all the cases to demonetisation. “Most of these cases are isolated ones. That action has been initiated in each one of these cases, however, is an encouraging sign,” he said.

Minister of State for Youth Affairs and Sports Vijay Goel will lead a Sahyog March with a group called Youth Against Black Money at Paharganj on Sunday. Mr. Vardhan’s campaign started from Gauri Shankar Temple near Lal Quila where he talked to the traders at many places and heard their problems. Dr. Harsh Vardhan assured the traders that although they “are facing difficulties today, in the future a changed trading system will develop which will make the traders more prosperous.” On Friday, BJP Delhi chief Satish Upadhyay had participated in a “sankalp march”, organised to garner public support for Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s demonetisation move.

Mr. Singh also said, “He as a countryman was proud to have such Prime Minister who was so dedicated and adamant to root out corruption.” “The people standing in queues outside banks are saying that the Prime Minister has punished all who have amassed huge wealth, whether they are from his party (BJP) or others,” he said and claimed that now they (black money hoarders) are getting “sleepless nights“. Mr. Singh claimed the move has reduced the gap between rich and the poor and now people would pay taxes instead of evading them. “I am not a BJP spokesperson but a SP Rajya Sabha member, whatever the opinion of my party might be on the issue but I have shared my personal view on it,” he said. However, he registered his protest against the mismanagement in implementing the demonetisation move, saying he was pained to the see people suffering due to it. “What is the purpose of implementing a scheme due to which poor, farmers, small traders and common people have to suffer?” he said. - PTI Printable version | Jan 7, 2017 1:36:15 AM | http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/Demonetisation-a-courageous-experiment-by-PM-Amar-Singh/article16725348.ece © The Hindu Sita Sahani offers a snapshot of life in the time of note bans and smartphones"

806,2016-11-27,20.0,Demonetisation hampers tobacco cultivation in Prakasam district,"Farmers in Prakasam district are at their wits end as severe cash crunch in the wake of demonetisation has hampered transplantation of tobacco, the main commercial crop in the drought-prone district during rabi. Farmers, who have been used to growing more than the crop size in the past despite the crop regulator imposing hefty penalties, are likely to produce at least 25 million kg less than the crop size 39.9 million kg in southern light soil (SLS) and 41.9 million kg in southern black soil (SBS) this fiscal. Farmers with two tobacco barns need at least Rs. 1.50 lakh to complete transplantation of seedlings procured, especially from Rajamahendravaram, says V. Varaprasad, Farmers’ Association president in Ongole II auction platform. “But bank officials are dispensing with only Rs. 4,000 to Rs. 10,000 in cash after we made repeated visits to banks since November 8,” complains a farmer Vadela Narayana Rao, who has begun transplantation in his 20-acre plot in Mangamoor village much against odds. “In view of the drought condition, water is being arranged by tankers at the rate of Rs. 500 per trip. I need to make a cash payment of Rs. 10,000 for water transportation alone,” explains the farmer, who finds it difficult to get loan even from private financiers. “How can we take up transplantation with meagre cash flow?” asks a group of angry farmers in Chekurpadu, near Nagulapupadu. So is the case with a majority of SLS and SBS farmers who are frantically hoping for return of liquidity. All payments are made only by way of cash to farm workers right from raising seedlings to curing of tobacco leaves in barns, explains S.Gurava Reddy, Farmers’ Association president in Ongole I auction platform. Demonetisation has come at a more inopportune time for the growers as it is during November that tobacco cultivation picks up pace in the traditional tobacco growing areas, former Tobacco Board member Ch. Ranga Rao says. He rules out cashless payments in the sector. Though the crop loan has been sanctioned, the amount had not been released with bank officials who are busy with demonetisation exercise like exchanging of scrapped notes, complains M. Anjaneyulu, a farmer from Maddipadu. Not to take any risk, Sanagala Venkateswarulu, a farmer from Podili, says he has kept away from tobacco cultivation this year. The crop coverage is only 2,700 hectares as against the authorised cropping area of 26,209 hectares in SLS, needing gap filling in large extent of land, says SLS Regional Manager G. Ratnasagar. It is somewhat better in the SBS region where the plantations have been taken up in 3,111.70 hectares as against 21,575.22 hectares permitted by the Tobacco Board, says SBS Regional Manager G.Umamaheswara Rao. “If the present situation continues tobacco production may drastically fall by 30 per cent from the authorised crop size of 81.8 million kg,” according to the Indian Tobacco Association (ITA) sources.

808,2016-11-27,20.0,Demonetisation: Hotel industry earnings drop by 50 per cent,"The daily revenue of hotels and restaurants has dropped by 50 to 60 per cent post demonetisation in Mysuru. Hit by currency crunch, the number of people going to restaurants has declined largely and the hotel industry here feels that the situation is unlikely to improve at least till mid-December. Continual fall The hospitality sector’s earning had seen a continual fall since September, barring a short period in October. Tourist footfall had seen a drastic decline in September following the Cauvery agitation. In that month, the revenue had fallen by more than 50 per cent with a fall in tourist arrivals, as protests had taken centre stage in the Bengaluru-Mysuru corridor. The Cauvery row cast a shadow on the Dasara festivities in October, causing revenue loss to the sector with drop in tourists. Dasara is the time when the hospitality sector hopes to earn good revenue. Mysuru Hotel Owners’ Association president Narayana Gowda told The Hindu that daily earnings of hotels, restaurants, sweet shops, and bakery sector had fallen from Rs. 1.5 crore to Rs. 60 lakh since demonetisation. No dip in costs Despite the fall in revenue, the costs involved in running hotels and restaurants has remained the same. “We have no option but to meet the expenses despite the fall in our income,” Mr. Gowda explained. “How can a restaurant give change for Rs. 2,000 for a bill of Rs. 200,” he asked. Most restaurants have put up boards urging customers to cooperate with them and provide change. “We cannot leave a customer because of change problem. How long can we give the reason of change problem since we are here to do business and earn our livelihood. We are doing our best to mobilise change to meet daily needs,” Mr. Gowda said. The association has resolved to pay salaries of workers in the industry in cheque to tide over the cash crisis.

In a letter to Union Finance Minister Arun Jaitley, he said demonetisation could be a good step so far as black money was concerned but adequate preparatory measures should have been taken prior to the move. “Sudden demonetisation of high value currency notes of Rs. 500 and Rs. 1000 without adequate preparatory steps has adversely impacted agriculture, tourism and overall revenue generation in a small State like Uttarakhand. “Demonetisation is weighing heavy on a State already battling the losses caused by the recommendations of the 14th Finance Commission,” Mr. Rawat said. Noting that a vast majority of people living in remote hill areas of the State depended on the cooperative banking system, he said exclusion of cooperative banks from any transactions (deposits and exchange) of the banned notes had put the rural populace, dependent on agriculture, in a tight spot as the sowing season was already underway and they had no cash to buy seeds and fertilisers. Noting that the current crisis might result in failure of rabi crop and subsequent rise in foodgrain prices, Mr. Rawat asked the Union Minister to allow cooperative banks to accept deposits of banned notes. Paucity of cash has led to a drop in sale, exchange of goods and services and affected tourism in general. It has had a negative impact on the state government’s sources of income, including VAT collections, he said. Also noting that demonetisation will lead to a rise in the Centre’s earnings through collection of direct and indirect taxes, the Chief Minister said the benefits should be shared with the States. - PTI Printable version | Jan 7, 2017 1:36:23 AM | http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/Rawat-asks-Centre-to-help-Uttarakhand-deal-with-demonetisation/article16725351.ece © The Hindu Sita Sahani offers a snapshot of life in the time of note bans and smartphones"

The correspondents, who are members of the A.P. Private Unaided Schools Association, cleansed the Gandhi statue before the Kurnool Collectorate with milk and garlanded it. The correspondents K. Janardhan Reddy, P. Pullaiah, Srinivasa Reddy, P. Kishtanna and others welcomed the bold decision of Prime Minister Narendra Modi to demonetise high value notes and said it would curb the menace of black money and fake currency. They termed the criticism of the demonetisation by some parties and leaders as illogical. Referring to reports on deaths in bank queues, they said such deaths were witnessed in stampedes for film tickets and in political and religious congregations. Considering the plight of the farmers, they demanded release of adequate number of Rs. 100 notes to banks. Carrying placards, they said the problem of the common man was not bigger than that faced during the freedom movement.

Though several political parties are protesting against it, both within and outside Parliament, the MDMK welcomes the move, said its leader Vaiko in Coimbatore on Saturday. Addressing journalists outside the airport en route Erode, he said that it was unfair to target the Prime Minister on the issue. The element of secrecy and surprise was necessary for the demonetisation move. But there were issues in the implementation and the government must address those. Water sharing On the river-water sharing issue, Mr. Vaiko said that the Punjab Government’s refusal to share water with Haryana and Rajasthan ought to be condemned. Upper riparian states should not be allowed to enjoy all the water and if this was allowed, tomorrow Karnataka could cite it as precedent to deny Cauvery water to Tamil Nadu. The Central Government should therefore act in an impartial manner to provide equitable water to all riparian states.

Speaking to reporters during an interaction here on Saturday, Sitaram Yechury, General Secretary of CPI(M), said a rollback and a slew of restrictions will stop even the possibility of eliminating the 2 or 3 per cent of stacked ‘black’ money. “Our concern is the people, whose economic activities and livelihood have been stalled due to the announcements. We want old notes to be exchanged and used in a wider variety of activities,” he said. ‘Protest, not bandh’ When asked if the protests planned on Monday against demonetisation would further inconvenience the public, Mr. Yechury said: “This is a call for protest action, not a bandh. The Opposition will march separately, but strike together. Our point is to redress the anger of the people. It’s demonetisation that has seen a bandh-like situation, as economic activities have come to a standstill.” ‘Pressure on PM’ The protest action is also to put pressure on Prime Minister Narendra Modi to address parliamentarians. “If he continues to remain silent (after November 28), the Opposition parties will have to think seriously,” he added. Speaking further on the Prime Minister’s silence in Parliament, Mr. Yechury said: “The tables had turned. (Former Prime Minister) Manmohan Singh’s speech in Parliament was articulate and powerful. Modi sat silently for an hour and left after the break. It is now, Narendra Maun Modi (a reference to the taunt ‘Maunmohan’ Singh during the tenure of the UPA government),” he said. ‘Our concern is the people, whose livelihood has been stalled owing to the announcement’ Printable version | Jan 7, 2017 1:36:26 AM | http://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/Yechury-Won%E2%80%99t-support-demand-for-rolling-back-demonetisation/article16725385.ece © The Hindu The lack of biodiversity has proved detrimental to native species, flora and fauna"
813,2016-11-27,20.0,Dairy farmers hit by demonetisation,"The demonetisation of high currency notes and restrictions on the withdrawal of cash from banks has hit the dairy farmers of Karimnagar, Rajanna-Sircilla, Jagtial and Peddapalli districts, falling under the jurisdiction of Karimnagar Milk Producer Company Limited. The Karimnagar dairy debits Rs. 9 crore through banks every fortnight to milk producers as payment for procuring milk. But, the dairy farmers were unable to withdraw not more than Rs.24,000 per week from nationalised banks as they do not have Kisan Credit Cards (KCC) to withdraw Rs.50,000 per week. The cooperative banks such as District Cooperative Central Banks (DCCB) and Telangana Grameena Bank (TGB) were providing cash not more than Rs.2,000 per week. The Karimnagar dairy procures 1.8 lakh litres of milk daily from 924 villages (milk producer institutions) and makes online payment to each milk institution through banks. The milk producer institution president and manager of milk chilling unit have joint cheque withdraw powers from banks and distribute money to the milk famers in their respective villages. The milk producer institution would be getting average fortnightly income of Rs.1.5 lakh to Rs.7.5 lakh, depending upon the supply of milk to the Karimnagar dairy. Each milk producer would get fortnightly income ranging from Rs.1,500 to Rs.10,000 and above. The demonetisation had become a cause of concern for the milk producers for purchasing essentials to eke out their living. Director and milk producer Prabhakar Rao of Mamidipalli village in Konaraopeta mandal in Rajanna-Sircilla district said farmers are agaitated over non-payment of their milk bills due to demonetisation and are abusing the field staff. Welcoming the demonetisation of high currency notes, Karimnagar Dairy chairman Ch. Rajeshwara Rao said that the decision had affected milk producers as they could not get their fortnightly income on time. However, we are taking all measures to ensure that the farmers get their payment at the earliest by talking to the banks concerned, he said, and added that they were also planning to open bank accounts to all the milk producers and make the online payment every fortnight.

A senior party leader said that the campaign sought to understand “the difficulties of the traders due to demonetisation of high-value notes” and is scheduled to be followed by a similar event in Paharganj. Minister of State for Youth Affairs and Sports Vijay Goel will lead a Sahyog March with a group called Youth Against Black Money at Paharganj on Sunday. Mr. Vardhan’s campaign started from Gauri Shankar Temple near Lal Quila where he talked to the traders at many places and heard their problems. Dr. Harsh Vardhan assured the traders that although they “are facing difficulties today, in the future a changed trading system will develop which will make the traders more prosperous.” On Friday, BJP Delhi chief Satish Upadhyay had participated in a “sankalp march”, organised to garner public support for Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s demonetisation move.

Thirunavukkarasar said here on Saturday. Pointing out that Mr. Mod rode to power promising that he would retrieve the black money stashed in Switzerland banks, Mr. Thirunavukkarasar claimed that instead of keeping his promise the Prime Minister had only put the hapless common man into trouble. Mr. Modi is acting like a dictator, he alleged. The TNCC president was here to preside over a regional convention of the Congress party in which leaders and cadres from Tiruchi, Pudukkottai, Thanjavur, Perambalur, Ariyalur, Tiruvarur and Nagapattinam districts participated in large numbers. “When many people in rural areas are unaware of the various applications in the advanced mobile phones and use it to only talk, how come Mr. Modi fancies that rural masses would go in for mobile banking?” Mr. Thirunavukkarasar wondered. What would people in areas do where there was no banking service do, he asked. Maintaining that the Congress was fighting for the welfare of the common man, the TNCC president exhorted his cadres to participate in the nationwide stir against the hazards of demonetisation slated for Monday by staging protests separately, just as the Left parties and the DMK were planning. There were many in the BJP who were in total disagreement with the demonetisation and its fallout, the TNCC president said adding even the Supreme Court has counselled caution in that regard. Mr. Modi has forgotten that he is the Prime Minister and was acting like a dictator, he said. The common man was not asking for Rs. 2,000 currency note but by introducing the high value currency, Mr. Modi has only facilitated those who were harbouring and hoarding black money leaving the commoners in the lurch. The Congress would fight for the welfare of the vulnerable sections, Mr. Thirunavukkarasar added.

816,2016-11-27,20.0,Temples busy counting demonetisation bounty,"The government move to withdraw currency of Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,000 denominations has been impacting collections at temples as devotees are dumping the scrapped notes in hundis. A couple of days ago, the Machavaram Anjaneya Swamy temple officials were taken by surprise when they opened the hundi (collection box). They found the demonetised Rs. 1,000 and Rs. 500 notes' bundles along with a few notes of lesser denominations. They found 50 to 60 bundles of Rs 1,000 and Rs. 500 denomination currency. Temple executive officer N. V. Sambasiva Rao said that the temple usually receives about Rs. 3 lakh as hundi offerings from devotees in about two months. This was the first time the temple hundi collection crossed Rs. 1 crore, which was a quantum leap. Generally, there would be a jump in the offerings during festivals but definitely not at this magnitude, he observed. Another temple, Jaladheeswara shrine at Ghantasala, received Rs. 50 lakh a week ago. A major portion of this offering was Rs. 500 and Rs.1000 currency notes. Sri Durga Malleswara Swamyvarla Devasthanam, one of the major temples in the State, is also not lagging. The temple has been receiving lakhs of rupees in specified notes. The temple received Rs. 22.58 lakh in Rs. 1000 denomination by November 11 and another Rs. 56.25 lakh in Rs. 500 notes. In a subsequent collection on November 17, devotees deposited Rs. 6.83 lakh worth of Rs. 1000 currency notes and Rs. 22.34 lakh worth of Rs.500 currency notes. The trend continued on November 24 counting also. The temple received Rs. 601 notes of Rs.1000 and 2,681 notes of Rs. 500. Another Rs. 3.79 lakh worth Rs. 1000 and Rs.500 notes were deposited on November 25. The hundis fill up fast during festivals and auspicious occasions.

817,2016-11-28,21.0,Three Postal officials in CBI net for currency exchange fraud,"Three officials of the Postal Service Department have been booked by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) for fraudulently exchanging Rs.36 lakh from demonetised notes of Rs.500 and Rs.1000 to the newly introduced Rs.2,000 notes. The malfeasance, which took place on November 12, came to light after CBI officials raided the Himayathnagar post-office on November 24. K Sudheer Babu, Senior Superintendent of Post Offices, Hyderabad City Division, G. Revathi, Sub-postmaster, Himayathnagar Sub-post office and G. Ravi Teja, office assistant, Hyderabad City Division and three unidentified government officials and private persons were booked by the CBI for misappropriating Rs.36 lakh instead of disbursing it among the general public. Request slips Based on the investigation by CBI officials, it was found that an amount of Rs. 74.73 lakh in the Rs. 2,000 currency notes were shown to have been exchanged against the old currency notes of Rs.500 and Rs.1000. However, only 987 request slips were found for just Rs.38.45 lakh against Rs.74.73 lakh, with the remainder of the Rs.36 lakh being unaccounted for. Based on credible information, a joint surprise check was conducted by officials of the CBI and the Postal Vigilance Cell. It was found that Ms. Revathi and Mr. Teja committed the malfeasance on the instructions of Mr. Sudheer Babu. Mr. Teja revealed that the Superintendent gave him old currency notes of Rs. 500 and Rs.1,000 amounting to Rs. 36 lakh and took new notes of Rs. 2,000 of the same amount in return, at the GPO, Hyderabad’s treasury itself. Residence searched Searches were also conducted at the residence of Mr. Sudheer Babu as part of the investigation, said a press release on Monday from the CBI. When contacted, an official from the Postal Service Department said that no suspension orders were issued so far, and that the CBI was yet to correspond with the department. He added that raids were conducted at other sub post-offices in Hyderabad as well. In case of any complaints of corruption in Central Government departments, banks, insurance companies and PSUs in the States of Telangana and Andhra Pradesh, people may contact 040-2473 2768 or 9010299553.

818,2016-11-28,21.0,Hyderabad unaffected by Opposition bandh call against demonetisation,"The nationwide shutdown called for by political parties opposing the demonetisation of higher currency notes had little impact on the daily life of the citizens. With the ruling party TRS (Telangana Rashtra Samiti) and the MIM (Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen), which has a significant influence over city, staying away from any kind of street protests on Monday, the State and Central government offices functioned without much disruption. Most of the schools and colleges in the city conducted classes for their students. For shops and establishments in major commercial areas, it was business as usual as most of them did not down the shutters. The IT corridor too remained insulated from any form of protests as the software and corporate companies functioned like any other day. The transport sector was also not hit. Autos, buses and private transport plied on the streets. Rallies and protest meets were organised by opposition parties. The Left parties held a rally from Sundarayya Vignana Kendram in Baghlingampally to Indira Park in Lower Tank Bund. Prominent leaders of CPI, CPI (M) and eight other left parties led the march. Congress party workers led by Telangana Congress Chief Uttam Kumar Reddy protested outside the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) premises in Saifabad. The Congress leaders including Mr. Reddy and Bhatti Vikramarka submitted a representation to the RBI officials after staging a sit-in protest. In their memorandum, the Congress leaders demanded that the Central government listen to the voice of people and deliberate a dialogue in Parliament on the entire exercise of demonetisation and make a collective decision rather than enforcing a dictatorial decision. They also demanded a white paper giving details of repercussions of demonetisation. The protests led to traffic congestion on the main roads surrounding Saifabad.

819,2016-11-28,21.0,Opposition holds protests against demonetisation,"raging fury: Congress workers take out a rally in Bengaluru on Monday.
  Opposition parties organised protests across the country on Monday against the Centre’s demonetisation move but normal life was not affected in most parts, except in Kerala and Tripura, two Left-ruled States. The biggest protest was perhaps held in Kolkata, where West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee took to the streets against the Centre. Leading a massive rally along a three-kilometre stretch in the city, Ms. Banerjee, who has sought a rollback of the demonetisation, vowed to “remove Narendra Modi from Indian politics.” Draped in her trademark white cotton saree, the Trinamool Congress (TMC) chairperson said at the end of the rally: “Whether I live or die, I will make Indian politics free of Modi.” “Cashless, or faceless... we have a leader who is faceless and baseless,” she said, adding, “Even Hitler would not have thought of such a thing.” After the rally, Ms. Banerjee left for Lucknow where she will hold protests over the next two days. In Kerala, public transport was off the road while shops, markets and commercial establishments were shut, impacting both the formal and informal sectors. As the Opposition held countrywide protests against demonetisation on Monday, in Kerala the ruling Left Democratic Front, which had called the hartal, had exempted the tourism sector and banks from the strike. However attendance in banks was low and tourists had a difficult time moving around and getting food. In Tripura, the 12-hour general strike call got a complete response with schools, colleges and shops remaining closed. There were clashes between CPI(M) and BJP workers in some parts of south Tripura. But in the rest of the country, including the national capital, the ‘Jan Aakrosh’ did not disrupt normal life. In Tamil Nadu, normal life was not affected during protests organised separately by the Left parties, the DMK and the Congress. In all, 3,409 persons were detained in the morning from across five locations in Chennai and were freed by evening. Among those detained were Opposition leader M.K. Stalin and former Union Minister T.R. Baalu, both of the DMK. In Telangana, with the ruling Telangana Rashtra Samithi and the MIM, which has a significant influence over Hyderabad, staying away from the protests, there was little impact on the daily life of citizens. While the Left and the Congress organised protests in various parts, most schools and colleges were open. Shops and establishments in commercial areas also functioned normally. The same was the case in Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Maharashtra, Rajasthan and Bihar. Opposition parties organised protests without disrupting life. In Lucknow, barring stray protest marches and poorly attended dharnas by the Congress and the Left, the protests received little support from the people. The Congress led the ‘Jan Aakrosh’ marches in Lucknow and other district headquarters with the party’s chief ministerial candidate, Sheila Dikshit, leading a march in Kanpur. In Bihar, the ruling party JD(U) stayed away from the protests but its alliance partners, the RJD and the Congress, took to the streets.   Printable version | Jan 7, 2017 1:36:48 AM | http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/Opposition-holds-protests-against-demonetisation/article16716945.ece © The Hindu Be it nature’s fury or man’s folly, destructions are alike.

820,2016-11-28,21.0,?Demonetisation will not hit IT sector hard?,"The demonetisation of high-value currency notes will have only a minor impact on the revenues of the outward-facing IT industry, asserted Shiva Ramani, CEO of iOPEX Technologies, a San Jose-based company engaged in providing optimised IT management services. Founded in 2009, iOpex has a large presence in Chennai. Since most of these firms were in the tax bracket and part of the banking system, the demonetisation impact had been low on them, Mr. Shiva Ramani said. “There is excitement for us, however. What if this drive increases tax compliance? What if this brings down corporate tax? It will be a phenomenal boom for us,” he added. He termed the demonetisation exercise a “very bold move.” He, however, said he would not hazard a guess as to whether it would pan out to be good or bad. “How good or how bad is the next question. But being decisive is in itself a big change from the last 10 years,” he added. “In the long-term, India will be a very viable market. And, if cashless or declared income becomes the middle of the pyramid, then all of us have a lot to gain,” he said. On the near-term impact of demonetisation, he said “economic activity will be significantly suppressed in the short-term. Rupee will further depreciate against world currencies.” However, he felt that some of these shocks could be manageable since the oil prices “are still marginal”. If the revenue was dollar-denominated, it would help the IT firms as their rupee revenue would go up significantly, he said. Quizzed on the the impact of Donald Trump's election as the new President of America on the Indian IT industry, he said, `` It is a complicated story. IT outsourcing will have marginal impact especially when local workforce is replaced by H1 workers as a part of large outsourcing deal involving offshore and onshore. But, in general, as the broader stock market is showing, it is overall going to be lot more business-friendly. As such, U.S. business will spend more and the knock on effect of more IT spend will happen.'' He said that the American democracy had got a lot of checks and balances. ""There will be a bit of inward focus but it won't be as catastrophic as everybody thinks. He (Mr. Trump) has already found middle ground on all his policies,'' Mr. Shiva Ramani pointed out.

821,2016-11-28,21.0,"Sovereign, pension funds line up to invest post demonetisation","In a positive outcome of the demonetisation exercise and black money clampdown, ‘Invest India’ — the government’s investment promotion & facilitation agency – has been flooded with queries from foreign pension funds and Sovereign Wealth Funds (SWF) regarding locations and sectors to invest in the country. Encouraged by this trend, ‘Invest India’ has decided to set up a dedicated team of experts by mid-December this year to cater to the needs of SWFs (state-owned investment entities) and foreign public & private pension funds and attract mega investments into India, Invest India’s Managing Director & Chief Executive Officer, Deepak Bagla told The Hindu. Road shows will be held soon across the world explaining how the demonetisation policy and the Goods & Services Tax legislation will ensure ease of doing business in India in a “clean manner” for SWFs and pension funds who have ‘ethical investment’ norms, he said. The world’s 300 largest pension funds had assets under management totalling $14.8 trillion in 2015, said Willis Towers Watson, a global advisory, broking and solutions company. Also, as of December 2015, SWFs accounted for $7.4 trillion in assets, while sovereign pension funds totalled $ 4.2 trillion, it said. For ‘ethical investments’, SWFs and foreign pension funds have high transparency and governance standards, and have to stick to their internal norms on anti-corruption and anti-bribery. India, which needs more than $1.5 trillion over the next decade for infrastructure funding, will be relying on these funds to ensure there is no shortfall. Union government sources told The Hindu that during discussions including those relating to India’s National Investment and Infrastructure Fund (NIIF), the SWFs and foreign pension funds had informed the government that they will be more comfortable investing in India if there is greater transparency in doing business, especially in the real estate & construction sectors where there is prevalence of cash transactions and influence of black money. Claiming that the black money cleanup will eventually strengthen the Indian Rupee, the sources said measures to ensure tax policy certainty, remove red-tape and prevent corruption are aimed at improving investor confidence, reducing their cost of funds and other transaction costs, in turn leading to greater Return on Investment. “The Indian economy has many positives, but the ‘post-truth’ – or statements relying more on general belief and less on objective facts – being circulated was so negative that these SWFs and pension funds have been reluctant to invest. The Investment Committees of these funds had concerns,” Mr. Bagla said. So far, India used to get only a portion of the funds allocated in the ‘emerging economy basket’ by the private equity players, but with the demonetisation and GST removing their apprehensions, they will hopefully set up a ‘country dedicated fund’ to make greater investments in India, he added. Once the SWFs and pension funds decide to step up their operations in India, the companies they have investments in, will also follow suit – leading to a multiplier effect, Mr. Bagla said. The SWFs in countries such as Norway, Canada, Singapore, US, Qatar and UAE have been making sector-specific enquiries prior to the demonetisation announcement as well as after it, but the SWFs from South Korea, Malaysia, Indonesia and Iran have done so after the demonetisation policy, the sources said. The NIIF, itself a quasi-SWF with a maximum government-holding of 49 per cent, will focus on commercially viable projects particularly in the infrastructure sector. It will see participation from foreign pension funds and SWFs as the government had held talks with SWFs like Abu Dhabi Investment Authority and Qatar Investment Authority as well as the Russian state-owned private equity & venture capital vehicle ‘Rusnano’.

Mr. Abhilash is one unfortunate expatriate who was struck hard by demonetisation, especially since he had come on leave from Dubai only for his wedding, which took place on November 16, barely a week after demonetisation was implemented in the country. At the time, every individual was allowed to withdraw only Rs.10,000 from an account a day. “Fortunately for me,” Mr. Abhilash said, “we were done with all the cloth and jewellery purchases by November 8. But I really struggled to manage the remaining expenses like the vehicle charges, cooks charges and the previous day’s function.” But the goodness of the rural people became a blessing for him in the dire circumstances. “I had known most of these people all my life. Hence many of them agreed to render their services on condition that I would pay them later,” he said adding that now he is withdrawing money from the bank every week to pay for their services. “I had no time to spend with my bride. Every one in the family, including my bride, stands in queue on a daily basis so that I can pay those people whom I owe, before I go back to Dubai,” Mr. Abhilash said. At Guruvayur His is not a lone experience. Most people who had planned wedding in the months of November and December had to go through a lot of hurdles. Sudhakaran E., a retired BSNL employee from Thondayad, organised his daughter’s wedding on November 23. His fault was that he had deposited all his retirement benefits in a cooperative bank. When the demonetisation stuck, he was unable to withdraw a single rupee. Fortunately for him, the wedding was held at the Guruvayur Sreekrishna temple and the expenses were very low. “We purchased the gold using debit cards. For the rest, everyone in the family withdrew Rs.20,000 each and within two weeks, we had enough money to conduct the wedding,” Mr. Sudhakaran said. Though there was a provision to withdraw Rs.2.5 lakh with the District Collector’s permission, Mr. Sudhakaran did not need it. Mr. Abhilash did not have the required documents to submit to the Collector, though he needed the money.

825,2016-11-28,21.0,Demonetisation woes: Fishermen keep off sea,"With demonetisation hitting fish trade in the coastal regions of Thanjavur, fishermen in the district have decided to keep off the sea. Alleging that cash crunch has prohibited fish traders from buying the sparse catch, they have demanded easing of cash restriction on withdrawals for fishermen and traders so that fishing activity continues. Fishing is the main vocation in the coastal towns of Sethubavachatram, Mallipattinam and Kallivayal Thottam areas. From here more than 2,000 fishermen set off in more than 300 mechanised fibre boats to indulge in deep sea fishing. When the Central Government announced the demonetisation measures on November 8, the cash crunch forced the fishermen to declare a strike on November 10 and 19. When the Centre eased some restrictions on withdrawals and payments at fuel stations, many fishermen started venturing into the sea from November 20. But the same withdrawal limit ensured that the numerous wholesale traders who used to swarm the markets in the coastal towns absented themselves. “Freshly caught untreated fish have little shelf life and we do not have any modern facility here to prolong the edible nature of the catch. The scores of fish traders who used to come to our towns and the fish landing jetty for purchasing the daily catch are not turning up these days as they are not having adequate cash to disburse to our fishermen. That means our fish catch is getting degraded within the same day and all our efforts are going down the drain with no benefit to us,'' said Fishermen's Association State Secretary Tajuddeen. Traders who export prawn used to bring large amount of cash as they could not give any bank instrument or transfer money through electronic gadgets to the fishermen. The nature of the fishing activity being what it is, only cash was the feasible option for both who sell and buy fish. Demonetisation put paid to all that since November 9. A meeting of the fishermen under the aegis of the Association was held on Sunday with Mr. Tajuddeen in the chair. The meeting resolved that considering the current situation when traders are not in a position to come and buy fish, there was no use in venturing into sea for fishing. As such, the fishermen in Thanjavur district have refrained from going to the sea from Monday. Meanwhile, at the fish markets in Thanjavur East Gate and at the Burma Colony, sales was dull. Since traders can't store fish for more than three days, many sellers were seen dumping the decaying fish.

826,2016-11-28,21.0,Demonetisation: General strike total in Tripura,"A deserted bus depot during the nationwide strike called by the Opposition against the demonetisation move, in Agartala, Tripura on Monday.
 
| Photo Credit: Abhisek Saha The twelve-hour general strike to protest against demonetisation of high value currencies evoked total response in Tripura. Four Left parties, including the CPI(M), called the strike on Monday to highlight ‘infinite sufferings of people’ following the ban of Rs. 500 and Rs. 1000 notes. The day, however, witnessed a clash between the CPI(M) and the BJP workers at Amarpur in south Tripura. The CPI(M) claimed that eight party workers were injured in ‘unprovoked attack’ on its procession. The BJP aggressively campaigned against the dawn-to-dusk strike, but to no avail. The call completely paralysed life, business and vehicular traffic, while government offices did not function due to nonattendance of staffs. Chief Minister Manik Sarkar and a few ministers worked from the Secretariat which had a very thin presence of employees. Chief Secretary Yaspal Singh and secretaries also attended office on Monday. The Left parties also decided to hold protests in front of the Central government offices to register their ire against demonetisation. Left Front State Committee Chairman Khagen Das said the week-long protest is taking place in all 23 sub-divisions of the State. Police said around 200 supporters of the BJP, the CPI(M) and the SUCI were arrested in the State for defying prohibitory orders. They were released in the afternoon. Besides the BJP, the Trinamool Congress and the Congress opposed the strike, but they were not active on the streets. The TMC took out a procession at the end of strike to condemn the decision of the BJP-led NDA government to withdrawal the high-value notes and causing sufferings of common people. Banking sector and post offices were kept out of purview of strike to help people deal with money matters. Examinations at educational institutions were allowed by the protesters.

827,2016-11-28,21.0,PM ready to speak on demonetisation; Opposition unimpressed,"Congress leader Mallikarjun Kharge speaks in the Lok Sabha, in New Delhi on Monday.
 
| Photo Credit: PTI Seeking to break the deadlock, Home Minister Rajnath Singht on Monday told the Lok Sabha that Prime Minister Narendra Modi will speak on demonetisation if the Opposition wanted, but the rival parties demanding debate with a provision for voting remained unimpressed, forcing the House to adjourn for the second time. A number of opposition leaders, including Mallikarjun Kharge (Cong.), Sudip Bandhopadhyay (TMC) and Mulayam Singh Yadav (SP), spoke as they pressed for acceptance of their demand for an adjournment motion, a condition not acceptable to the Treasury benches which want a debate without voting. With the Opposition parties firm on their stand, Mr. Singh said nobody is questioning the government’s intentions over demonetisation or imputing any mala fide. He said that the government was willing to listen to the complaints and suggestions different parties have over the execution of the demonetisation move. “As far as the Prime Minister coming to the House is concerned, if the Opposition wants he will come and intervene. I want to assure the Opposition. We are ready for a discussion,” the Home Minister said during the Zero Hour, after the Opposition leaders spoke. The decision on under which rule the discussion would take place is for the Speaker to make, he said. Demonetisation is a “historic, bold and pro-poor” decision, Mr. Singh said, adding that it was taken to target black money and was in national interest. However, members of a dissatisfied Opposition rushed to the Well, forcing Speaker Sumitra Mahajan to adjourn the House till 1400 hours. Earlier, Mr. Kharge said demonetisation had harmed the economic system, the farmers, youths, labourers and women among others who are in distress. Maintaining that over 70 people have died due to the faulty implementation, he cited the incident of a Union Minister facing difficulty in paying hospital bills after his brother died and said it is an evidence of the crisis. Union Minister Sadananda Gowda’s brother had died in Karnataka. “There is only one way to break this deadlock. The Prime Minister should come here (to the House) and our adjournment motion be accepted,” Mr. Kharge said. Mr. Bandhopadhyay said the government must take initiative to break the impasse as people will ask what does Parliament stand for, if it is adjourned everyday. Supporting Mr. Kharge, the SP chief said if Mr. Modi does not come to the House on such an important matter, then when he will come. Farmers are facing a lot of problems, he said. Jai Prakash Narayan Yadav (RJD) called the decision impractical and anti-people. An AIADMK member said the government should take initiative to ease people’s sufferings, while B. Mahtab (BJD) said the onus was on the Centre to take steps to break the impasse. Anandrao Adsul (Shiv Sena) said neither ‘Bharat Bandh’ nor ’Aakrosh Diwas’, which different opposition parties have announced for Monday, was visible but lamented that the recent announcement of NABARD disbursing Rs. 21,000 crore to cooperative banks has not been implemented. Situation remains bad in rural areas, he said. When the Lok Sabha met again at 2 p.m. after adjournment, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley rose to introduce a bill to amend the Income Tax Act allow authorities impose 75 per cent tax and 10 per cent penalty in case they detect undisclosed wealth deposited post demonetisation. Members from the opposition parties, who were asking the Speaker to take up their adjournment motion on note ban, rushed to the Well raising slogans. Mr. Jaitley then introduced the bill amid din. The din and slogan shouting against the government continued for another few minutes and the House was adjourned for the day, 10 minutes past 2 p.m. Printable version | Jan 7, 2017 1:37:00 AM | http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/PM-ready-to-speak-on-demonetisation-Opposition-unimpressed/article16715147.ece © The Hindu Be it nature’s fury or man’s folly, destructions are alike.

828,2016-11-28,21.0,Opposition protests over demonetisation continue in Rajya Sabha,"Opposition members protest in the well of Rajya Sabha, in New Delhi on Monday.
 
| Photo Credit: PTI A united Opposition on Monday continued to disrupt proceedings in the Rajya Sabha over hardships caused to the people due to demonetisation of 500 and 1000 rupee notes, forcing two adjournments in the pre-noon session. The Congress, the Trinamool Congress (TMC) and the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) members trooped into the Well shouting slogans against the government, forcing proceedings to be adjourned first for 30 minutes and then till noon. Soon after the House mourned the death of Cuban revolutionary leader Fidel Castro and the listed papers were laid, Naresh Agrawal (SP) said nationwide protest is being observed on Monday against demonetisation that has caused hardships to common man. ‘All India Protest’, Aakrosh Diwas said, has been called to highlight the hardships. As Mr. Aakrosh Diwas raised the issue other opposition leaders, including Mayawati (BSP), Derek O’Brien (TMC), Sitaram Yechury (CPI-M), Anand Sharma (Cong.) joined in. Leader of Opposition Ghulam Nabi Azad said the nation was seething in anger over the hardship and harrassment caused because of the announcement made by the Prime Minister Narendra Modi on November 8, 2016. Soon the Congress and the TMC members trooped into the well of the House shouting slogans against the Prime Minister. Ruling benches also joined him by shouting slogans favouring start of a discussion on the issue. I&B Minister M. Venkaiah Naidu rose to state that the discussion which had started on the opening day of the winter session of Parliament on November 16 and has not yet concluded, should be resumed, instead of such disruption of proceedings. Deputy Chairman P.J. Kurien agreed with the suggestion of Mr. Naidu but the din continued, forcing him to adjourn the proceedings for half an hour. When the House met after adjournment, the Opposition was again on their feet shouting slogans like ‘Janta Ka Paisa Janta Ko Do’ (Give money to the people, it is theirs). Deputy Chairman Mr. Kurien insisted that the discussion on the demonetisation be resumed, when Mr. Sitaram Yechury (CPI-M) asked “Why is the Prime Minister not coming (to the House)?” “You start. The Prime Minister will come. How do you know that the Prime Minister will not come,” Mr. Kurien said, adding that it is already on the record that the Prime Minister will speak on the issue. As the Opposition members kept shouting slogans in the Well, the Chair adjourned the House till noon. When the House reassembled at noon for Question Hour, Leader of Opposition and senior Congress leader Ghulam Nabi Azad said he wanted to “make it clear” that 18 Opposition parties have decided to observe ‘Jan Akrosh Divas’ on Monday. “We did not discuss anything on Bharat Bandh. If anyone has raised the issue of Bharat Bandh, it is the Prime Minister. He is responsible for Bharat Bandh. “We are observing this day as ‘Jan Aakrosh Divas’ to raise the ‘aakrosh’ (anguish) across the country. There is ’aakrosh’ (anger) among the youth, the women and the old against this new policy of demonetisation,” Mr. Azad said, adding that so far 75 people have lost their lives due to the government’s decision to go for demonetisation. The senior Congress leader also said a 96-year-old man had died while standing in a queue outside a bank in Chennai and also the death of a young girl who did not have money for her wedding. Earlier, when Mr. Ansari allowed Mr. Azad to speak, Information and Broadcasting Minister M. Venkaiah Naidu rose to take up an issue saying, “We need to raise a point.” Mr. Ansari, however, said the floor has already been given to Mr. Azad and if the government has a point it would be allowed later. Amid the din raised by treasury benches, Chairman Hamid Ansari adjourned the proceedings till 1400 hours “because the House is not being allowed to run.” When the House met again at 2 p.m., Commerce Minister Nirmala Sithraman placed a notification on behalf of Finance Minister Arun Jaitley providing for exemption of central excise duty for the manufacture of PoS devices (Point of Sale). Soon after this, SP leader Naresh Aggarwal raised a Point of Order. As he started, he made certain comments about the Treasury Benches which was objected to. Deputy Chairman P.J. Kurien eventually expunged the remark after listening to both the sides. Later, Congress leader Anand Sharma raised a Point of Order, saying the Constitution specifically says that a person cannot be deprived of his property by the government. He questioned how then the government is depriving the country and the common man of their own money in the bank accounts by limiting withdrawals. He said nearly 80 people have died due to demonitisation move while standing in queues. “It is illegal and there is no law under which this has been done,” Mr. Sharma said. “Even the Constitution does not allow the Prime Minister or the government to deprive the citizens of their money and property, especially bank accounts. Not one bill was tabled in the House. The Prime Minister and the government must answer,” he said. Leader of the Opposition Ghulam Nabi Azad said such an important decision was announced after the Session was called for and before it actually began. This is the first time when such an announcement has been made and the Prime Minister has not given a statement in the Parliament, Mr. Azad said. He said the opposition has demanded discussion over the move to demonetise Rs. 500 and Rs. 1000 notes in both the Houses, but in the presence of the Prime Minister since he has announced the move. He said some are saying that the Cabinet was not informed and even the Finance Minister did not know. “Then how can he (Finance Minister) reply to the points raised by us. Prime Minister should be here,” Mr. Azad said. Taking a dig at Mr. Modi, he said he can even come to the Parliament Library for events and address every rally in Uttar Pradesh but can’t come to the House. As Congress’ sloganeering followed, Minister of State for Parliamentary Affairs Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi said the government is ready for discussion like always. “You failed with your ‘Aakrosh Diwas’ on the streets, so now you are disrupting the House proceedings,” he said. Following the ruckus, Mr. Kurien adjourned the House till Tuesday morning.

829,2016-11-28,21.0,Demonetisation takes shirt off the back of textile traders,"A cloth merchant waits for customers at Vastralata, hub of cloth business in Vijayawada.
 
| Photo Credit: V_RAJU. The wedding season has brought no cheers to the textile traders in the city. Business activity in the bustling markets of One Town has slowed down as a fallout of the demonetisation even after two long weeks. With the temporary cash crunch, the wedding season has turned into a nightmare for traders. It affects close to 50,000 people who are either directly or indirectly dependent on the business in the city as some shopkeepers are already laying off hands. The wedding season is the time when traders do most of their business but the lack of liquidity has led to problems. The reason: the traders have not yet adopted the modern practice of online payment. Most of the transactions here are done through cash. A vast majority of the traders in One Town do not have online payment facility, which drives customers away. Despite strong competition from malls, the traders have so far managed to retain and increase their customer base. But, due to the cash crunch, the business has taken a severe beating. It is like domino’s effect. The retail sales have plummeted as the customers are starved of currency and are spending the notes available with them only for emergency purposes. “As the retailers don’t have any business, the wholesalers also don’t,” reasons Vastralatha Cloth Merchants’ Association president Ch. Raghuram. In fact, this is the worst year for the textile traders. There was a little business during the Sravana maasam, a wedding season, due to Krishna Pushkaram. The business did not pick up much after the river jamboree. The retailers place huge orders in December for Christmas and Sankranti. The festive mood is missing, says another trader. The One Town is a hub of textile business with the Vastralata Complex and the Krishnaveni Cloth Market drawing retailers and customers across the State. A huge inventory of clothes and textiles arrivesfrom Tamil Nadu, Maharashtra, Gujarat, Uttar Pradesh and West Bengal, and retailers from neighbouring districts too place orders here. There are about 2,000 textile traders in the city. Of this, 407 shops are in the Vastralata complex alone, and most of them are into wholesale business. And, the nearly same number of shops are there at the Krishnaveni Cloth Market in One Town. The traders don’t disclose the actual volumes of business for obvious reasons. But business of roughly Rs.100 crore takes place everyday and the loss is estimated around Rs. 1,000 crore.

830,2016-11-28,21.0,Vaiko justifies demonetisation move yet again,"Differing yet again with his three allies, MDMK leader Vaiko continued to strongly justify Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s decision to withdraw Rs. 500 and Rs. 1000 notes, saying it was a strategic blow delivered by the latter against corrupt and black money holders in the country. Incidentally, his allies — the CPI, the CPI (M) and the VCK — have extended full-throated support to Monday’s nationwide strike against the demonetisation move. Mr. Vaiko has contended that there was no need for him to conform to the views of the other parties in the People’s Welfare Front (PWF) as all the political parties could not have similar views on all issues,” Mr. Vaiko told The Hindu on Sunday. “For instance, there is no uniform view among the PWF partners on the LTTE. We agree to disagree on some issues. When Mr. Modi made the announcement on demonetisation, I immediately welcomed it. Contrary to popular perception, the common man had welcomed the demonetisation move. I am not saying this from ivory tower. I am meeting and mingling with ordinary people and those who are on the edge of society on day-to-day basis. While as [former Union Finance Minister] P. Chidambaram said, though they are not eating fruits every day, they do feel it is a good move aimed at eradicating black money,” Mr. Vaiko said. Even though he agreed that a section of society and traders was facing hardships, he said one had to swallow bitter bills to cure the disease. “The situation will become normal in 30 days and people will see the result of Mr. Modi’s efforts,” he said. When asked what was the point in printing Rs 2,000 notes when higher denomination currencies were said to have contributed to black money in a big way, Mr Vaiko claimed if the government had printed smaller denominations like Rs. 100, the black money holders would have got wind of the government’s plan.

Uttam Kumar said that demonetisation of high-value currency has aggravated the agrarian crisis and demanded that the State government take immediate steps to ensure that farmers do not lose the ongoing Rabi season. Mr. Reddy, who visited Achampet in Nagarkurnool district to address ‘Rythu Garjana’ rally on Sunday, said farmers were already in crisis due to non-clearance of their crop loan waiver dues by the State government. They lost four consecutive crops due to drought situation. In view of good rainfall, farmers were expecting a good Rabi season. However, their hopes were lost when the BJP government at the Centre announced demonetisation without realising that the process would overlap Kharif harvest and Rabi sowing season hitting lakhs of farmers. He asked the State government to extend immediate assistance to farmers to ensure that they do not fall short of funds to carry out sowing operations. Mr. Uttam Kumar Reddy alleged that the Telangana State Level Bankers Committee, in its recent meeting, has admitted that a very small percentage of proposed Rs. 11,300 crore was disbursed to farmers towards Rabi loans. Further, with the State government not clearing the dues under promised Rs. 1 lakh crop loan waiver scheme has completely denied farmers an opportunity to avail fresh loans.

834,2016-11-28,21.0,Demonetisation and its discontents,"Demonetisation seems to have made friends of foes, and foes of friends in the political firmament. If Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar differed from his allies while heaping praise on Prime Minister Narendra Modi for embarking on demonetisation, Shiv Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray was critical of his party’s senior partner in government for “bringing tears in the eyes of the people” who had voted it to power. In West Bengal, Mamata Banerjee and her Trinamool Congress showed a readiness to join hands with arch-rival Left Front to fight the demonetisation drive. While the withdrawal of high-denomination notes can hardly be expected to trigger a political realignment anywhere, political parties seem to be rising above mundane political calculations while reacting to the demonetisation. A cynical view might be that Mr. Kumar is keeping his political options open by building bridges with the BJP, and keeping his politically junior but numerically stronger ally, the Rashtriya Janata Dal, in check. Arguably, he could be trying to recover his assiduously cultivated anti-corruption image, which took a beating following his electoral pact with Lalu Prasad of the RJD. But a simpler explanation cannot be ruled out: that Mr. Kumar saw some merit in the demonetisation drive, even as he recognised the difficulties in implementation. Similarly, the Sena cannot afford to break with the BJP at this juncture. Quite likely, Mr. Thackeray was prompted not by the possibilities of political realignment (of which there is practically none), but by the realities on the ground, in distancing himself and his party from the demonetisation decision. In West Bengal, an alliance between the Trinamool and the Left Front is inconceivable, but that did not stop Ms. Banerjee from reaching out to the CPI(M) in her fight. If political parties have thus reacted unpredictably, it could just be on account of the mixed results seen on the ground. None can afford to be seen as directly opposing measures to clean up black money and weed out counterfeits. However, stories of cashless banks and shuttered ATMs seem to have given some life to opposition parties looking for an issue to pin the government down on. Reports of the BJP having made huge cash deposits in banks in West Bengal, and land deals in Bihar days before the demonetisation, have provided some ammunition to opposition parties that were initially reluctant to criticise the move for fear of being labelled supporters of black money hoarders and counterfeiters. Demonetisation might not have changed political equations, but it has shaken up the political scene. What they cannot oppose in principle, parties have opposed in practice.

835,2016-11-28,21.0,Demonetisation is a flood that will wash out black money from country: Shah,"Terming demonetisation as a flood that will wash out black money and corruption from the country, BJP national president Amit Shah on Sunday said the decision was giving “sleepless nights” to leaders of the Congress, Samajwadi Party, Bahujan Samaj Party, Aam Aadmi Party, and Trinamool Congress. “The Opposition leaders who were asking what [Narendra] Modi has done about black money till the evening of November 8, changed their tone suddenly and started asking why Mr. Modi had done this [demonetisation],” he said. Atop a tree “It is a flood-like situation where you find one tree in the middle on which rats, cats, mongooses, and snakes have climbed to save themselves from the gushing water,” Mr. Shah said. Taking the analogy further, he said: “Interestingly, the mongoose and the cat are not eating the snake and the rat. They all have joined hands against Mr. Modi’s fight against black money and corruption.” He said leaders such as Rahul Gandhi, Arvind Kejriwal, Mulayam Singh Yadav, Mamata Banerjee, and Mayawati had “climbed up a tree to safeguard themselves”. “Is there black money with the poor? The only people who have been affected by the move are those who have lost black money,” he said. Nitesh’s support He welcomed Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar’s support to the Prime Minister’s decision on demonetisation. “I would like to thank Mr. Nitish Kumar as he has stood by Mr. Modi’s decision,” he said.

Addressing the media at the 69th NCC Day celebration held in the premises of the NCC Group Head Quarters in Puducherry, the Lt. Governor said that the banks were now in a better position to lend money. “We can invest in infrastructure to provide better healthcare, roads and transport facilities.

837,2016-11-28,21.0,RINL hopeful of overcoming demonetisation fallout,"As the impact of demonetisation is seen mostly on secondary and scrap dealers, Rashtriya Ispat Nigam Limited, the corporate entity of Visakhapatnam Steel Plant, is confident of overcoming the fallout of demonetisation. As it remained not much hit due to the currency crisis as e-payment is a pre-requisite to buy its products, it hopes that the crisis faced in construction industry will be overcome in the coming months. The steel industry, as such is hit by global recession and crisis arising out of dumping of cheap steel from China. RINL, a Navratna company, registered a sales turnover of Rs. 600 crore during November 1 to 20 as against total sales of Rs. 860 crore during the same month last year. The company registered a net loss of Rs.1,421 crore during last fiscal due to market sluggishness and China impact. RINL sales during first half was Rs. 6,520 crore as against Rs. 6,373 crore of last year. Observers say the current crisis will be over in a month or two and the grounding of mega projects promised by the Central and State governments will generate more demand for steel. RINL produces long products required for construction of big dams, roads, flyovers and other infrastructure projects. All transactions are done online. Hence, the currency crisis, the officials say, will not have direct bearing on them. Asked for a specific comment on impact of demonetisation, RINL Chairman-cum-Managing Director P. Madhusudan told The Hindu that “It’s a very good move. It is likely to impact growth in short-term. But some short-term pain for many long-term gains is most welcome.” There is also a demand by RINL management and trade unions to give preferential treatment to its products for use in the construction of capital at Amaravati. On the other hand, Steel Exchange India Ltd (SEIL) belonging to Vizag Profiles Group, which produces Simhadri TMT, admits demonetisation has slowed down sales due to standstill in realty business and exudes confidence that the demand will pick up soon. “It’s a temporary setback due to fear that land prices will crash. But our assessment is that money flow will not be hit and the people will change their opinion,” SEIL Director V.V. Krishna Rao said.

838,2016-11-28,21.0,TDP membership drive hit by demonetisation in TS,"Demonetisation of the higher denomination currency notes appears to have its telling impact on the Telugu Desam Party. The demonetisation exercise initiated by the Central Government and thereby, the shortage of smaller denomination of currency notes, has reportedly slowed down the party’s ongoing membership drive at least in Telangana. With the deadline for enrolment as members coming to a close on November 30, the party could register names of 1.76 lakh active members till date. This is in stark contrast to the conservative target of enrolling 14.17 lakh members as part of the ongoing drive. Coupled with the demonetisation issue is the Group II examination held last week. Several youth enrolled as operators to collate the membership data and host it online too could not complete the job in time. Senior leaders of the TDP as well as the party president and Andhra Pradesh N. Chandrababu Naidu acknowledged the significant drop in the membership numbers at an extended meeting of the TDP Telangana general body here on Sunday. “The enrolment last time was 54 lakh members and this time it is 32 lakh members. Demonetisation definitely had its impact on the party, but this will be a temporary phenomenon,” Mr. Naidu said addressing the general body. The party reportedly faced difficulties in enrolling members as the fee of Rs. 100 for each member is hard to come by owing to the shortage of the currency denomination in the market. Outlining the difficulties faced in fulfilling the target, senior leaders like E. Peddi Reddy, who is coordinating the process, asked Mr. Naidu to extend the deadline. Mr. Naidu, however, asked them to focus on accelerating the process and submit a report by November 30 based on which a decision could be taken. This will be a temporary phenomenon N.

Further, only eight per cent of the GDP entailed cashless transactions while the rest were through cash, he said. In retrospect, the exit of Raghuram Rajan as the RBI governor made sense as he never would have supported the move, the CPM leader alleged. According to him, it was preposterous to dub those who oppose demonetisation as hoarders of black money, alluding to criticism of the opposition condemning Prime Minister Narendra Modi.

The demand and supply gap of smaller denomination currency notes was being constantly watched and measures being taken to overcome the same. Bankers were monitoring the demand position in the district and at the State-level the Chief Minister was personally reviewing the supply position from time to time, he told reporters here. The Collector said ever since the demonetisation notification was issued, meetings were being held with bankers at the mandal and district levels to avoid inconvenience to the people. The Chief Minister was also reviewing the situation through teleconference and video conference every day. An action plan was prepared for promoting cashless transactions by activating the existing bank/Jan Dhan accounts of pensioners, issuing and activation of RuPay cards, opening of Jan Dhan accounts through banking correspondents and organisation of special campaigns to create awareness among people, especially those in the rural and tribal areas and in slums in the city. He said there were 738 bank branches, 9.30 lakh Jan Dhan accounts and 37.26 lakh other accounts in the district. Of the Jan Dhan accounts, 6.70 lakh (72 per cent) and 27.76 lakh (75 per cent) of other accounts were seeded with Aadhar accounts. The number of people who have no bank accounts was about seven lakh. The number of existing Point of Sale (PoS) machines available at merchant establishments was 6,101 and 563 new PoS machines were added since November 9. Additional machines An additional 9,096 machines would be required in the district. He said training modules had been prepared at the district-level to educate the public on the use of mobile banking, Internet banking, RuPay cards, mobile apps and POS swiping machines. Special focus was being given to educate tribal people at the weekly shandies. The Collector said a 6,109 PoS machines were functional in 10 departments in the district as against the requirement of 8,637. 0Measures were being taken to acquire more PoS machines. Mr. Pravin Kumar said that from December 1, Fair Price shops in the district would go for ‘cashless’ transactions and disbursal of pensions would also be in the same mode except in areas, where there was no network connectivity and in cases of pensioners, aged above 75 years of age, who were not in a position to visit bank branches.

841,2016-11-28,21.0,The demonetisation move,"The Central government’s move to demonetise high value currency in an attempt to snuff out black money is welcome. But there is a severe shortage of new notes. Even in a major metropolitan city such as Chennai people are struggling to live as the new Rs.2000 notes are worthless. If this is our plight in the city, what about those who live in towns and villages? H. Mohamed Azarudeen, Chennai The Prime Minister’s comment that the critics of demonetisation had “no time to prepare” — implying that they all have black money — is uncalled for and unacceptable. Has he forgotten that these critics include common people of great integrity such as non-political observers, economics experts, foreign dignitaries, judges, the political Opposition and even some allies of the government? In a democracy, there is a right to dissent. One fails to understand why the Prime Minister is incapable of facing criticism on policy matters and executive orders. The widespread chaos, confusion, frustration and anger are there for all to see. P.R.V. Raja, Pandalam, Kerala A lot has been said about demonetisation. No doubt, per se, it is laudable, perhaps necessary too. However, an exercise of this kind requires meticulous planning and execution so that the public faces minimum inconvenience. This is where so-called “good governance” lies; the government has failed miserably on this count. Given the situation, what has happened is borne out of a political desperation rather than out of any economic compulsion. Having committed itself to the agenda of bringing back black money and having failed in all other routes, the government has announced the current measure in an almost sensationalist mode. M.

842,2016-11-28,21.0,Demonetisation: Unions demand salary in cash,"Post-demonetisation, some of the trade bodies, including railway employees’ unions and Tamil Nadu State Transport employees’ union, have demanded that the salary payable in December be paid in cash to their members and not through regular electronic clearance. The Centre has put a cap on daily withdrawal from the ATMs at Rs. 2,500. “If lakhs of railway men stand in the queue on December 1 for withdrawing money at the ATMs and banks, it will only add to the existing problem,” said Southern Railway Mazdoor Union general secretary N. Kannaiah. He said only the salaried class would be affected as their salary was deposited in banks. Traders carried out money transactions every day and had easy access to currencies of smaller values. “How does the government expect ‘running’ staff like me (a railway guard) to stand in queue for a whole day to withdraw money,” asked divisional secretary of Dakshin Railway Employees Union R. Sankaranarayanan. However, he was quick to add that the very demand for disbursement of entire salary in cash was only to put some pressure on the government. The union leaders said the payment of salary advance of Rs. 10,000 made on Thursday was only because of their demand. M. Nandasingh, national council member of All India Trade Union Congress (AITUC), said his organisation had urged the heads of all 21 transport corporations in the State to stop remittance of daily collections in banks. “The money of smaller denominations could be used to make salary payment to transport corporation employees,” he said. Stating that disbursement of salary through electronic clearance has been done only for the last eight years, he said the standing order of transport corporation was payment of salary in cash. However, a bank official said it was highly impossible to provide cash for entire salary of the Central Government and State Government employees in view of the cash crunch faced by the banks. “The ceiling on withdrawal of Rs. 24,000 a week stands good for all for the simple reason that we do not have cash. Besides, salary disbursement through cash will defeat the very idea of the Union Government to encourage transactions through banks,” he said.

843,2016-11-28,21.0,Commission gangs spring up in city post demonetisation,"Senior police officers feel that commission agents have sprung up all of a sudden across the city to make a fast buck, after the demonetisation was announced by Prime Minister Narendra Modi. They also have concrete information that some bankers are hand-in-glove with the agents and are trying to make the best use of the demonetisation process, by channelising old notes for new ones through multiple accounts. Already into its third week after the scheme was announced to de-notify Rs. 500 and Rs. 1000 notes, sources say the department has placed its teams across the city and have identified a few gangs, but are unable to catch them red-handed. Describing the modus operandi a senior officer said, “The commission agents are gathering people, especially jobless youth who have legal bank accounts and are asking them to deposit old currency ranging from Rs. 50,000 to Rs. 2 lakhs, which they get from persons who have black money. And after depositing, they are told to withdraw in phases, as per the limit and then they pay back the person who has given the old notes after deducting a commission varying from 10 to 20 per cent. So if a person given Rs. 2 lakh in old currency, they are paid back Rs. 1.60 lakh in new currency.” Coming to bankers, the officer said a few employees were under the scanner. The bankers are also grouping in helping them (agents) to deposit into multiple accounts and allowing them to withdraw, and at times are also depositing small amounts into their own accounts, said the officer. The police in the last few days apprehended a few people with huge cash but were unable to act upon, as there is no provision to arrest them, due to lack of a penal code. Agents identified According to sources, the city police have identified about 20 such commission agents. However, an I-T official informed The Hindu , that people depositing somebody’s money into their account would be treated as ‘Benamidar’ which would attract The Prohibition of Benami Property Transactions Act, 1988 (the Benami Act).

Mr. Reddy, who visited Achampet in Nagarkurnool district to address ‘Rythu Garjana’ rally on Sunday, said farmers were already in crisis due to non-clearance of their crop loan waiver dues by the State government. They lost four consecutive crops due to drought situation. In view of good rainfall, farmers were expecting a good Rabi season. However, their hopes were lost when the BJP government at the Centre announced demonetisation without realising that the process would overlap Kharif harvest and Rabi sowing season hitting lakhs of farmers. He asked the State government to extend immediate assistance to farmers to ensure that they do not fall short of funds to carry out sowing operations. Mr. Uttam Kumar Reddy alleged that the Telangana State Level Bankers Committee, in its recent meeting, has admitted that a very small percentage of proposed Rs. 11,300 crore was disbursed to farmers towards Rabi loans.

845,2016-11-28,21.0,Demonetisation takes shirt off the back of textile traders,"The wedding season has brought no cheers to the textile traders in the city. Business activity in the bustling markets of One Town has slowed down as a fallout of the demonetisation even after two long weeks. With the temporary cash crunch, the wedding season has turned into a nightmare for traders. It affects close to 50,000 people who are either directly or indirectly dependent on the business in the city as some shopkeepers are already laying off hands. The wedding season is the time when traders do most of their business but the lack of liquidity has led to problems. The reason: the traders have not yet adopted the modern practice of online payment. Most of the transactions here are done through cash. A vast majority of the traders in One Town do not have online payment facility, which drives customers away. Despite strong competition from malls, the traders have so far managed to retain and increase their customer base. But, due to the cash crunch, the business has taken a severe beating. It is like domino’s effect. The retail sales have plummeted as the customers are starved of currency and are spending the notes available with them only for emergency purposes. “As the retailers don’t have any business, the wholesalers also don’t,” reasons Vastralatha Cloth Merchants’ Association president Ch. Raghuram. In fact, this is the worst year for the textile traders. There was a little business during the Sravana maasam, a wedding season, due to Krishna Pushkaram. The business did not pick up much after the river jamboree. The retailers place huge orders in December for Christmas and Sankranti. The festive mood is missing, says another trader. The One Town is a hub of textile business with the Vastralata Complex and the Krishnaveni Cloth Market drawing retailers and customers across the State. A huge inventory of clothes and textiles arrivesfrom Tamil Nadu, Maharashtra, Gujarat, Uttar Pradesh and West Bengal, and retailers from neighbouring districts too place orders here. There are about 2,000 textile traders in the city. Of this, 407 shops are in the Vastralata complex alone, and most of them are into wholesale business. And, the nearly same number of shops are there at the Krishnaveni Cloth Market in One Town. The traders don’t disclose the actual volumes of business for obvious reasons. But business of roughly Rs.100 crore takes place everyday and the loss is estimated around Rs. 1,000 crore.

Ambedkar Circle – which passed through the main streets of the city – that culminated at Onake Obavva Circle. They also raised slogans against the Union government and Prime Minister Narendra Modi. The agitators alleged that the demonetisation of Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,000 notes has put farmers, daily wage workers and dealers of seeds and fertilizers in trouble as they are now unable to purchase materials required for agricultural activities. The dealers of seeds and fertilizers are not ready to accept Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,000 notes from farmers who come to purchase the material, they alleged. After standing in long queues to exchange notes in banks and post offices, farmers have only been successful in getting some notes of Rs. 2,000 denomination. However, the problems of farmers have further worsened as the dealers refuse to take Rs. 2,000 notes, as they cannot offer change in return, they alleged.

According to a press release, the Chennai Corporation will continue to accept old currency notes of Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,000 from property tax assessees and trade licence holders at 446 counters across the city. As part of a special campaign to improve tax collection, the civic body began collecting property tax in old currency notes on November 12.

Residents are requested to call the civic body helpline 1913 for clarifications. The civic body is yet to collect property tax from most of the 11.7 lakh assessees for this half year period. It is planning to collect at least Rs.100 crore as property tax by the December 15 deadline. Assessees have to pay property tax within 15 days of the commencement of every half- year period, namely April 1 and October 1.

They said the demonetisation of Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,000 currency notes that came into force without any precautionary steps taken to assuage the problems being encountered by traders and the common man had derailed trading completely. Though new Rs. 2,000 currency note was released it failed to check the magnitude of the problem. Situation worsened The absence of new 500 rupee note for financial transactions and the non-availability of Rs. 100 and Rs. 50 notes made the situation from bad to worse. “Moreover, the restrictions imposed on withdrawal of cash from the current and savings bank account have hit the public, especially the traders. Hence, the Central Government that miserably failed to foresee the impact of demonetisation should expedite the remedial measures,” the speakers at the protest venue stressed. Tirunelveli Regional Chairman of the Confederation M.R. Subramanian presided over the agitation in which office-bearers K. Murugesan, M.R. Gunasekaran, R.P.K. Selvakumar, M. Panneerselvam, and G.

852,2016-11-29,22.0,Deposits rise even before demonetisation,"Deposits in commercial banks in the district have shown an increase of nearly 10 per cent during the current fiscal even before demonetisation announced. The credit off take in priority sectors too showed an increase, exceeding the Annual Credit Plan target during the first half of the current financial year. The official statistics obtained by The Hindu shows that deposits in the banks stood at Rs. 14,911.11 crore at the end of the first half of the current fiscal – September 30 – as against Rs. 13,637 crore on March 31, 2016. Lead District Manager S. Sundaramoorthy attributes the increase in the deposits to the rising faith of people in banks as a safe destination to keep their savings. “The confidence levels have gone up primarily because of various cheating incidents reported in the district. Many have been duped by certain institutions after collecting deposits offering attractive interest rates,” he said. The credit flow to priority sectors like agriculture and MSMEs has shown an increase too. The total disbursement during the first half of the current financial year was of Rs. 4,465 crore against a target of Rs. 4,383 crore. Despite a weak monsoon, the loan disbursement to agriculture sector stood at 103 per cent of the target. Bank officials say that the loans were taken to sink more borewells, replace the old water distribution pipelines, and for preparation of land for rabi sowing. The credit flow to MSME sector stood at 101 per cent during first half of the fiscal. “Currency was reasonably fairing well and also government gave rebate on State levies like Value Added Tax to the tune of 3.2 per cent, which enthused garment manufacturers to take loans to execute more orders,” said S. Dhananjayan, a chartered accountant and industry consultant.

853,2016-11-29,22.0,Demonetisation hits sheep traders hard,"Bala tal gayi (the worst is over), says Sunny Khatik, a sheep trader from Jabalpur in Madhya Pradesh about how the demonetisation of Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,000 currency notes has affected his business. Inside the sheep/goat market in Ziyaguda, the mood is shifting from deep gloom to sombre reality among the farmers, shepherds, butchers and traders. “The business was nearly zero for 15 days. Now it is looking up and in another 15 days things will get back to normal,” says Mr. Khatik. But, not everyone shares the bright picture painted by the man from MP. The sheep market in Ziyaguda is a mini India. Spread over a vast area, it is a daily market with traders from Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan, Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh coming to buy and sell animals. “Everyday we used to trade in two or three truck loads of sheep with each carrying about 250 animals. But now, the business is down and we are managing to sell only one truck load per day. This will have a big effect on farmers as they will have to take care of the animals with nothing in return,” says Ushakiran a wholesale dealer. “People are no longer serving meat in marriages and I have not had work for the past eight days,” says Narsing, a butcher for hire, who gets Rs. 300 to Rs. 400 per lamb he processes in the Ring Road Crossroad area. Ironically, the price of meat or animals has not declined due to demonetisation. Hyderabad gets sheep from nearby places like Shadnagar, Mahbubnagar, Sircilla, Kaikoor, etc. Due to this currency crisis many of the villagers are not coming to the market with their sheep. There is immense pressure on them to take old currency notes and that is one of the reasons they are keeping away, points out Akbar, who trades in goats in the Toli Masjid area. A butcher for hire, Ramlal accepts the old currency notes as he doesn’t have a choice and can deposit them into his bank account. The problem is with big traders, who have stopped using the currency and cut down on purchases affecting the whole market. On Sundays, Ramlal hailing from Langar Houz, used to deal with four or five sheep, but over the past 20 days, he had slaughtered only seven animals. “You can imagine the situation at home,” says Ramlal.

854,2016-11-29,22.0,Easing curbs may leadto currency shortage,"With the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) easing the restrictions on cash withdrawals from Tuesday, currency shortage ​could snowball into a fresh crisis in the week ahead. An RBI circular issued to all banks on Monday said that curbs on cash withdrawals had affected deposits and hence withdrawals beyond the Rs.24,000 limit could be allowed after Tuesday, but preferably in higher denominations such as Rs.2,000 and Rs.500 notes, it said. Banking sector sources told The Hindu here that but for issuing the circular​,​ corresponding changes were not made in the software of the banks till Tuesday. Though some banks had credited the salary for November into their employees’ accounts, informal directions had been given to limit the cash withdrawals to Rs.10,000 a day. Frantic withdrawals The circular issued for raising the limit may trigger frantic cash withdrawals. There is a growing tendency, mainly among small businessmen and traders, to hoard Rs.100, Rs.50 and Rs.20 notes, anticipating a scarcity in the coming days. Moreover, banks will have to meet the salary commitment of a large chunk of the 5.5 lakh State government employees, 3.5 lakh service pensioners, as well as a legion of employees of shops, commercial establishments and schools who draw their salary through banks. This would eventually lead to a spurt in demand for currency of all denominations from December 1. Banks are now vesting their hopes on the RBI assurance that their currency chests will be replenished from time to time and there will be no shortage as anticipated. As per the estimates of the Finance Department, the government, on an average month, requires Rs.750 crore on the first day of the month to disburse the salary and pensions, Rs.700 crore on the second day and the demand will taper to Rs.250 crore on the seventh day. The cash requirement would be much higher in the case of banks. Sustaining the supply in banks as well as ATMs will not be an easy task. This would force the banks to informally restrict the cash payments and set a much lower limit for cash withdrawals, sources said.

855,2016-11-29,22.0,RBI data shows reduced cash exchange and bank deposits following demonetisation," Banking activities related to demonetisation seems to have slumped in the last ten days. A total of Rs. 2.99 lakh crore was deposited in banks from November 19 to November 27, 40 per cent less compared to Rs. 5.11 lakh crore that was deposited during November 10 to November 19, data from Reserve Bank of India show. Withdrawal — over the counter or through ATMs — saw a slight increase in the second period, from Rs. 1.03 lakh crore to Rs. 1.13 lakh crore. Overall, Rs. 2.16 lakh crore has been withdrawn from banks from November 10 to 27. As of March 2016, the total value of notes in circulation was Rs. 16.42 lakh crore, of which around Rs. 14 lakh crore (86%) was in form of Rs. 500 and Rs. 1000 notes. “It has been observed that over the counter exchange of the old currency notes of Rs. 500 and Rs. 1000 denomination has shown a declining trend,” the government press release dated November 24 remarked. Data shows the decline was indeed significant. During the period of November 10 to 18, on an average, Rs. 3,667 crore was exchanged over the counter every day. However, from November 19 to November 24 — after which exchange was stopped — the total amount exchanged was just Rs. 942 crores, which means Rs. 157 crores per day, on an average. On November 15, the government decided to use indelible ink to check multiple visits to the cash counter for exchange, which may have led to this drop.

856,2016-11-29,22.0,Demonetisation: Fitch cuts India?s FY17 growth forecast to 6.9 p.c.,"Post the demonetisation announcement on November 8, the government and banks have been taking several steps to push digital transactions.
  Fitch Ratings on Tuesday lowered India’s GDP growth forecast for this fiscal to 6.9 per cent from 7.4 per cent, saying there will be “temporary disruptions” to economic activity post demonetisation. It said economic activity will be hit in the October-December quarter because of the cash crunch created by withdrawal and replacement of 500 and 1000 rupee notes that accounted for 86 per cent of the value of currency in circulation. “Indian growth has also been revised down to reflect temporary disruptions to activity related to the RBI’s surprise demonetisation of large-denomination bank notes,” Fitch said, as it revised real GDP growth forecast down to 6.9 per cent for 2016-17, from 7.4 per cent projected earlier. The U.S.-based ratings agency also revised the GDP growth forecast for 2017-18 and 2018-19 lower to 7.7 per cent from 8 per cent earlier. “Gradual implementation of the structural reform agenda is expected to contribute to higher growth, as will higher real disposable income, supported by an almost 24 per cent hike in civil servants’ wages. “But the anticipated recovery in investment looks a bit less certain in light of ongoing weakness in the data,” Fitch said in its ‘Global Economic Outlook - November’ report. Regarding currency ban, it said consumers do not have the cash needed to complete purchases, and there have been reports of supply chains being disrupted and farmers unable to buy seeds and fertiliser for the sowing season. “Time spent queuing in banks is also likely to have affected general productivity. The impact on GDP growth will increase the longer the disruption continues,” Fitch said, adding the medium-term effect of the currency withdrawal on GDP growth is uncertain, but is unlikely to be large. “Most importantly, demonetisation is a one-off event. People who operate in the informal sector will still be able to use the new high-denomination bills and other options (such as gold) to store their wealth,” it added. Fitch said there are no new incentives for people to avoid cash transactions and the informal sector could soon go back to business as usual. Post the demonetisation announcement on November 8, the government and banks have been taking several steps to push digital transactions. Fitch said it expects RBI’s 1.50 per cent policy rate cuts since the beginning of 2015 to feed through to higher GDP growth, even though monetary transmission has been impaired by relatively weak banking sector health. “A surge in low-cost funding due to the demonetisation may remove a constraint on banks that prevented lending rates from keeping pace with the RBI’s policy rate cuts in recent years, although this will depend on deposits remaining in banks beyond the next few months,” it said.

The Socialist Democratic Party of India too held a protest at Athupalam. The DMK-Congress protest in front of the Coimbatore South Taluk office saw over 600 cadre stage the protest led by former Union Minister A. Raja and district secretaries - M. Muthusamy (Coimbatore Urban North), Nachimuthu (Coimbatore Urban South), C.R. Ramachandran (Coimbatore Rural North) and Tamilmani (Coimbatore Rural South). Congress district secretaries V.M.C. Manoharan (Coimbatore Urban) and K. Maheshkumar (Coimbatore Rural) led the protests. The cadre shouted slogans against the Central Government saying it was the common man who was the most affected. Mr. Muthusamy told journalists that the BJP had selectively leaked the demonetisation information three months ahead of the Prime Minister’s announcement and that had helped big cats escape unaffected. Most of the black money was abroad and within in the country, it was in the form of land and jewellery. Therefore, the Government’s move would not lead to black money eradication. In stead, it would only hurt the common man, salaried class and traders. The Government must pump in cash into the system to mitigate the suffering. The district Secretary of Communist Party of India-Marxist V. Ramamoorthy led the protests near the Coimbatore Collectorate. State Executive Member K. Thangavel said that the Government must give time till December 30 to the people to use the demonetised Rs. 500 and Rs. 1000 notes as legal tender. Sources said that around 80 cadre led by the SDPI district president A. Mustafa staged the protest at Athupalam. The DMK cadre against staged a protest near the party’s North Coimbatore party office condemning the arrest of their leader Stalin in Chennai. Tirupur Staff Reporter adds Members of Left parties and DMK held demonstrations in different parts of the city on Monday condemning the hardships caused on common man due to demonetisation. CPI district secretary M. Subramanian said the steps followed by the Union Government would not curb black money as spelt out, but only end up causing troubles to people. “We are all against black money. But the steps chalked out for demonetisation for the projected objective of curbing black money lacked vision. Black money could now get stacked in Rs 2,000 denominations”, he said.

858,2016-11-29,22.0,HC refuses to adjourn hearing in cases against demonetisation,"MADURAI: The Madras High Court Bench here on Monday refused to adjourn after December 2 the hearing on a public interest litigation petition seeking to declare the newly introduced Rs. 2,000 notes as invalid since they contain Devanagiri numerals and another PIL petition taken by the court suo motu with respect to exempting the demonetised Rs.500 and Rs.1,000 notes in the custody of various courts in the State from the exchange deadline of March 31, 2017. A Division Bench of Justices S. Nagamuthu and M.V. Muralidaran declined a request made by Assistant Solicitor General G.R. Swaminathan to defer the hearing in both the PIL petitions to next week since the Supreme Court was slated to take up for hearing on December 2 an application preferred by the Centre last week to get transferred to the apex court all cases pending before various High Courts in the country with respect to demonetisation. Concern Pointing out that the application had already been listed for admission on Wednesday, the judges pointed out that the apex court had refused to stay the proceedings before various High Courts. “If what was reported in the newspapers is right, then the Supreme Court had also said that the High Courts are free to decide the cases on their own. Then, why should we adjourn these cases. We are concerned with the money in court custody,” Mr. Justice Nagamuthu said. Before posting the case related to demonetised money in court custody for hearing on Wednesday and the PIL petition, filed by ‘Agri’ K.P.T. Ganesan, against Rs.2,000 notes to Friday, the judge said that around Rs.5.8 crore was in the custody of courts in Kanniyakumari, Tirunelveli, Thoothukudi, Madurai, Dindigul, Theni, Ramanathapuram, Virudhunagar, Sivaganga, Pudukkottai, Thanjavur, Tiruchirappalli and Karur districts. Of that amount, the courts in Karur district alone had demonetised Rs.500 notes worth Rs.6.4 lakh and Rs.1,000 notes worth Rs.44.09 lakh. Proposal “Come up with some proposal for handling these notes. Reserve Bank of India should say how to go about with the money. We are responsible for returning the money to the owners after the conclusion of trial in criminal cases. It is mostly the money of victims in robbery, theft and other criminal cases. “Even if we say that we will not return the demonetised notes to the parties, they will have to be compensated. We want to save only legal money in court custody,” the judge told the ASG.

Thirumavalavan alleged that the hidden agenda of demonetisation was to expropriate money from the common man to infuse it into the cash-starved banks, which can later lend them to big corporates. Addressing a protest meeting here on Monday as part of the nationwide shutdown called by Left parties, he said that demonetisation would not be helpful since black cash was insignificant compared to black wealth held in other forms like foreign currencies, gold and lands. “Therefore, the idea is to inject all the cash into banks, particularly public-sector banks, which are already reeling under pressure due to non-payment of thousands of crores of loans by big corporates,” he alleged. He said that if Prime Minister Modi was serious about controlling black money, he should have started with bringing reforms in elections, which he claimed is the breeding ground for corruption and black money. “However, we cannot expect that from BJP, which spent the maximum money in the last parliamentary election. Is it not the big corporates who funded them?” he questioned. He said that the claim of the central government that demonetisation would help in moving towards cashless economy was also unrealistic as the country lacked necessary infrastructure. He added that such a move would wipe out small-scale traders and favour big companies. Mr. Thirumavalavan also criticised Prime Minister Modi for refusing to discuss the issue in the Parliament and instead branding everyone opposing demonetisation as black money hoarders during his public meetings. Leaders from Communist Party of India, Communist Party of India (Marxist), Socialist Unity Centre of India (Communist) and Communist Party of India (Marxist-Leninist) Liberation also spoke at the function.

Stalin on Monday said the exercise had actually turned out to be a war by Prime Minister Narendra Modi against 85 per cent of the rural population in the country. Leading a demonstration in Chennai as part of the nation-wide protests by the opposition parties including the DMK to highlight the hardship caused to people by the recall of Rs. 500 and Rs 1,000 notes, Mr. Stalin said while his party supported the efforts to eradicate black money, the government should have addressed the problems created by demonetisation. “We will continue our protests unless the government immediately rectifies the situation,” said Mr. Stalin, who, along with some of the party’s district secretaries, were arrested by the police and released in the evening. He said November 8, the day on which Prime Minister Modi announced the demonetisation move, was seen by people as yet another tsunami, and normalcy had not returned even after 20 days. “The Centre is just extending the deadlines (for the use of demonetised notes for exempted categories) without making any serious attempt to tide over the crisis,” he charged. Recalling Mr. Modi’s electoral promise to bring back black money deposited in foreign banks and that every Indian would get Rs. 15 lakh as bank deposit, Mr Stalin wondered whether the Prime Minister was able to deposit at least Rs 15 in their accounts. He said small traders, farmers, agriculture workers, fishermen and people in the lower rung of the society had been subjected to enormous hardship by the Centre. “The government employees are not spared. That is why we are urging the Centre to pay their salary in cash. The government may say the salary will be credited in their accounts. Can they use cheque to buy vegetables and milk?” he asked.

Mr. Vaghela said the common man is struggling to withdraw their hard-earned money. “Prime Minister Narendra Modi has done this [demonetisation] keeping in mind the upcoming State assembly elections. But the [Central] government should keep the interest of the public before that of the party. Only this BJP government can create a system where the police will beat you up for struggling to withdraw your own money.” Accusing Mr. Modi of following the Hitler mode of functioning, Mr. Solanki claimed the Prime Minister will give money deposited by the public to industrialists whose loan defaults run into lakhs of crores of rupees. The Congress also held rallies at Banaskantha where party workers handed over a memorandum to the Collector. A group of farmers blocked a State highway, halting traffic for hours before the police dispersed them. Markets in the tribal town of Naswadi in Chhota Udepur district remained closed. The NCP staged a protest near the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) building. The police detained around 70 workers, including 15 women, saying they did not have the police permission to hold the rally. However, senior NCP leader Praful Patel and Gujarat NCP president Jayant Patel were allowed to go inside the RBI building to make a representation to the officials. Mr. Praful Patel alleged that the BJP-led government and the RBI have failed miserably to address the issue of cash crunch. “We are with the government on this fight against black money. But our contention is that people are facing hardship even 20 days after the demonetisation. Neither the government nor the RBI has any roadmap to deal with the problem.” Dubbing the BJP-led Central government as anti-poor, Maharashtra Pradesh Congress Committee (MPCC) president Ashok Chavan in Mumbai on Monday said his party will raise the demonetisation issue in Parliament and the State legislature. The winter session of Maharashtra Legislature begins in Nagpur from December 5. Mr. Chavan alleged that the government had waived Vijay Mallya’s loan but not that of farmers. “The BJP government at the Centre is anti-poor. Nine farmers have committed suicide recently; still the government has no shame.” Mr. Chavan said the citizens, who deposited their money in bank accounts, are not able to withdraw it. Small traders, farmers, labourers, and working class have been the worst-hit. Rural economy has virtually collapsed, he said.

He claimed that corruption and dealing in black money had gone up by 10 times in November, after Mr. Modi announced demonetisation, as compared to October. “Gold, property and dollar exchange is being done at much higher prices through wrong channels. Generation of black money in the last 20 days is up by 10 times. Police have caught people with huge amounts in Rs. 2,000 notes. How did they manage to get this money?” Mr. Kejriwal asked. He said Mr. Modi was ‘torturing’ and causing grave inconvenience to people and now it had become an ego issue for him. Questioning the purpose behind Mr. Modi’s decision, the Chief Minister said it was done in the name of stopping terrorism, corruption and circulation of counterfeit currency. “Rs. 2,000 notes are found at terrorists’ hideout. Corruption is high and I don’t know where the fake currency producing factories are, India or Pakistan. More fake currency notes are minted in those factories than the RBI is releasing authentic notes in banks and markets,” he said.

864,2016-11-29,22.0,Work apace for biennale despite demonetisation woes,"It was like a bolt from the blue. The overnight withdrawal of the most circulated currency notes almost threw a spanner in the spadework for the forthcoming edition of the Kochi Muziris Biennale, as the organisers suddenly found themselves not able to pay wages to the 150-odd carpenters, masons, electricians, welders, painters, and other workers contracted to get the venues ready before the contemporary festival of art begins on December 12. “It dealt a huge blow to all of us — workers, artists, skilled artisans and support staff — who have been working in a time-bound fashion in view of the brief schedule of several artists and technicians in the city in the preparatory phase. Nevertheless, work never came to a complete halt,” said Bose Krishnamachari, president of the Kochi Biennale Foundation (KBF). Indeed, currency shortage did create a few hiccups initially, but “it is the people [the workers] who have known us over the years, so we managed,” said Biennale chief executive Manju Sara Rajan. “We have begun to pay those with bank accounts online and asked others to open accounts,” she added. Even as the venues are getting ready and construction is apace at key venues like Aspinwall House and Cabral Yard where major installations are coming up, shipping of art works from various parts of the world is in progress. “It is a huge task, also counting that we must return most of these works at the close of the biennale. This, despite the fact that some artists are okay with maintaining their works here, but we do not have a permanent venue. The State government has, however, promised us all support and may extend help in this regard,” said Mr. Krishnamachari. The upcoming edition, estimated to have an all-up cost of Rs.27 crore, will see 97 artists from across the world showcasing their works in the main show held across 12 venues. Besides the regular venues, the main biennale will also have, for the first time, a venue at Kottappuram, in collaboration with the Muziris Heritage Project. The State government is set to release the first instalment of Rs.7.5 crore it pledged for the coming edition, but the heads of the artists-run biennale toured the country and outside over the past few months to mobilise funds. “We have received patronage from kind souls and while we are still struggling, we are managing the show. Then there are those who have supported us in kind,” said Mr. Krishnamachari.

865,2016-11-29,22.0,?Demonetisation cannot curb black money?,"Stating that demonetisation of Rs. 500 and Rs. 1000 cannot curb black money, Viduthalai Chiruthaigal Katchi leader Thol. Thirumavalavan alleged that the hidden agenda of demonetisation was to expropriate money from the common man to infuse it into the cash-starved banks, which can later lend them to big corporates. Addressing a protest meeting here on Monday as part of the nationwide shutdown called by Left parties, he said that demonetisation would not be helpful since black cash was insignificant compared to black wealth held in other forms like foreign currencies, gold and lands. “Therefore, the idea is to inject all the cash into banks, particularly public-sector banks, which are already reeling under pressure due to non-payment of thousands of crores of loans by big corporates,” he alleged. He said that if Prime Minister Modi was serious about controlling black money, he should have started with bringing reforms in elections, which he claimed is the breeding ground for corruption and black money. “However, we cannot expect that from BJP, which spent the maximum money in the last parliamentary election. Is it not the big corporates who funded them?” he questioned. He said that the claim of the central government that demonetisation would help in moving towards cashless economy was also unrealistic as the country lacked necessary infrastructure. He added that such a move would wipe out small-scale traders and favour big companies. Mr. Thirumavalavan also criticised Prime Minister Modi for refusing to discuss the issue in the Parliament and instead branding everyone opposing demonetisation as black money hoarders during his public meetings. Leaders from Communist Party of India, Communist Party of India (Marxist), Socialist Unity Centre of India (Communist) and Communist Party of India (Marxist-Leninist) Liberation also spoke at the function. District-level leaders and cadres of DMK also carried out a separate protest against demonetisation in Palanganatham here on Monday morning.

The protest was part of a nationwide exercise. On reaching the railway station premises, the demonstrators held a dharna, which was inaugurated by DCC president Kodikunnil Suresh MP. In his address, Mr. Suresh said Prime Minister Narendra Modi who kept on evading addressing the Parliament on the demonetisation issue should resign. “Instead of addressing the Parliament on the issue, the Prime Minister brags about it outside Parliament,” Mr. Suresh said. Through the demonetisation move, the prime minister has made life miserable for the people of the country. Large sections of the people are even starving as a result of the demonetisation,” he said. The KPCC spokesman Rajmohan Unnithan also spoke. The march that began from the Armed Reserve Police camp junction culminated on the railway station premises after passing through Chinnakada. Party leaders E. Marydasan, P. Jermias, A.K Hafees and George D. Kattil led the march. The dharna carried on for about two hours.

867,2016-11-29,22.0,"Demonetisation is another tsunami, says Stalin",": Alleging that the demonetisation move had crippled development in all fields in the last 20 days, DMK treasurer and the Leader of the Opposition M.K. Stalin on Monday said the exercise had actually turned out to be a war by Prime Minister Narendra Modi against 85 per cent of the rural population in the country. Leading a demonstration in Chennai as part of the nation-wide protests by the opposition parties including the DMK to highlight the hardship caused to people by the recall of Rs. 500 and Rs 1,000 notes, Mr. Stalin said while his party supported the efforts to eradicate black money, the government should have addressed the problems created by demonetisation. “We will continue our protests unless the government immediately rectifies the situation,” said Mr. Stalin, who, along with some of the party’s district secretaries, were arrested by the police and released in the evening. He said November 8, the day on which Prime Minister Modi announced the demonetisation move, was seen by people as yet another tsunami, and normalcy had not returned even after 20 days. “The Centre is just extending the deadlines (for the use of demonetised notes for exempted categories) without making any serious attempt to tide over the crisis,” he charged. Recalling Mr. Modi’s electoral promise to bring back black money deposited in foreign banks and that every Indian would get Rs. 15 lakh as bank deposit, Mr Stalin wondered whether the Prime Minister was able to deposit at least Rs 15 in their accounts. He said small traders, farmers, agriculture workers, fishermen and people in the lower rung of the society had been subjected to enormous hardship by the Centre. “The government employees are not spared. That is why we are urging the Centre to pay their salary in cash. The government may say the salary will be credited in their accounts. Can they use cheque to buy vegetables and milk?” he asked. Later talking to reporters, he said even though there were reports that Chief Minister Jayalalithaa was responding well to treatment and she was able to talk and walk, she had not explained her stand on demonetisation. “There is a doubt whether the media reports are correct or not,” he said. Mr. Stalin added that it was unfortunate that Finance Minister O. Panneerselvam, who is holding the portfolios of the Chief Minister, also had not explained the State government’s stand on the issue. State govt. slammed “The AIADMK government is functioning like a Thuglak darbar. In some places, it has arrested the DMK leaders, and in many places, they have allowed them to leave after the demonstration.” Printable version | Jan 7, 2017 1:38:19 AM | http://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/Demonetisation-is-another-tsunami-says-Stalin/article16743431.ece © The Hindu The cyclone wreaked havoc on the city throwing normal life out of gear.

Patil,"Asserting that every Indian, including political parties, do not support black money, district in-charge Minister, M.B. Patil, however, has said that the Union Government has introduced demonetisation in haste only to hide its failures. Addressing a gathering at M.G. Circle here on Monday as part of Aakrosh Divas, he said that the improper implementation of demonetisation has now created an economic anarchy in the country. Mr. Patil said that before coming to power, the BJP had promised to bring the back black money stashed in foreign banks within 100 days of coming to power. “The BJP has not fulfilled its promise even after over two years in power. Instead, it has demonetised Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,000 notes which has made lives of the common people miserable. The party, that had promised to get Rs. 15 lakh deposited into the accounts of every citizen, has made the same common man to struggle to get his own hard earned money from the banks,” he said. Stating that over 70 people have died post-demonetisation while standing in queues outside banks and ATMs, Mr. Patil said that the BJP was saying that people have to face some problems for the success of the scheme. “Who will pay for the lives of those who have died?"" the Minister asked. Claiming that the BJP spent over Rs. 1,000 crore in the last General elections towards campaigning, he asked the source of the money and why the BJP was not revealing any details on it if was against black money. Mr. Patil met several shopkeepers at LBS Market. The shopkeepers said that their earnings have substantially dropped post-demonetisation.

Cadres from Communist Party of India (CPI), Communist Parties of India (Marxist) and Viduthalai Chiruthaigal Katchi raised slogans against the Centre and Prime Minister Narendra Modi. The demonstrators said that demonetisation was squeezing the poor off their savings and their livelihoods, while the real tax evaders were walking free. Earlier, protests by the DMK cadre were led by Dharmapuri MLA Thadangam Subramani. DMK and the Left parties also staged protest in Krishnagiri. Salem Special Correspondent adds: The police picked up hundreds of DMK cadre for staging a demonstration in protest against the demonetisation of high value currency and arrest of party treasurer M.

The speakers said the demonetisation was enforced without a far-sighted approach and precautionary measures, thus affecting people belonging to middle and lower income groups. “While the middle class cannot withdraw money from banks to meet emergency needs, farmers, fishermen, weavers and daily wage workers are undergoing untold hardships. Those having Rs. 2,000-notes unable to buy anything as traders refuse to accept it owing to shortage of lower denomination currencies.

When the news about the arrest of party treasurer M.K. Stalin in Chennai reached here, they started staging a road roko near Anna Statue and caused a traffic snarl around Tirunelveli Junction. The police immediately arrested the protesters. They were freed in the evening. The DMK staged similar protest in front of Tenkasi railway junction.

871,2016-11-29,22.0,Chit funds business too hit by demonetisation,"Faced with cash crunch due to demonetisation, chit funds fear payment default if the situation does not improve. Chit fund is a financial tool that allows people to save and borrow at the same time. A few members come together and decide on making a monthly contribution each month and would then be entitled to take a lump sum on a pre-determined auction date. Some chit funds are registered, but most of them operate informally in neighbourhoods and unofficially among office colleagues, making it one of the riskiest financial institution. “Main users of chit funds are daily wage earners, salaried individuals, housewives and micro, small and medium enterprises (MSME). The proceeds are used by households for consumption purposes like marriage, buying property and other unforeseen emergencies,” T S Sivaramakrishnan, general secretary of All India Association of Chit Funds (AIACF), said. Consumers pay their monthly instalments in cash, and MSMEs, which also deal in cash, account for 20 per cent of business, but 80 per cent of value for most chit funds. Sivaramakrishnan, who is the director of Balussery Benefit Chit Fund, said such customers are facing inconvenience and finding it difficult to pay monthly instalments. “It would be difficult to honour the payout commitments to subscribers because our cash flow gets affected. And the main pinch would be felt during the start of next month when payments become due.” Manoj Padmanaban, CEO, The Mayavaram Financial Chit Corporation, which runs Rs. 1 lakh to Rs. 50 lakh chits, said cash crunch would continue for the next three months and MSMEs would be the most hit because they do cash transactions. In the long-term, the move would help registered chit funds, as it would weed out unregistered operators. Sivaramakrishnan said his firm is looking at POS options and was also in talks with players like Paytm to enable electronic payments of monthly subscriptions. The problem with POS is the two per cent charge, which is difficult to foot when registered chit funds are operating at five per cent commission.

Manoharan (Coimbatore Urban) and K. Maheshkumar (Coimbatore Rural) led the protests. The cadre shouted slogans against the Central Government saying it was the common man who was the most affected. Mr. Muthusamy told journalists that the BJP had selectively leaked the demonetisation information three months ahead of the Prime Minister’s announcement and that had helped big cats escape unaffected. Most of the black money was abroad and within in the country, it was in the form of land and jewellery. Therefore, the Government’s move would not lead to black money eradication. In stead, it would only hurt the common man, salaried class and traders. The Government must pump in cash into the system to mitigate the suffering. The district Secretary of Communist Party of India-Marxist V. Ramamoorthy led the protests near the Coimbatore Collectorate. State Executive Member K.

874,2016-11-29,22.0,"?Demonetisation has disrupted economy, affected the poor?","‘Aakrosh Divas’, a day of protests called by the Congress and other parties, did not affect life here on Monday. Schools, government and private offices and business establishments functioned as usual. Buses, autorickshaws, and private vehicles moved freely. Meanwhile, members of the Congress took out a rally to protest against demonetisation. They described it as a case of monumental mismanagement that has led to the disruption of the economy. Leaders, including district Congress committee president Khaji Arshed Ali, Rahim Khan, MLA, KSRTC vice-chairman Basavaraj Bulla, member of the Karnataka State Temperance Board Shantalinga Savalagi, and Irshad Pehelwan walked to the Deputy Commissioner’s office and submitted a memorandum addressed to President Pranab Mukherjee. They urged the President to direct the Union government to roll back the decision and avoid a Constitutional crisis. India is a cash-based economy, they said, adding that rural areas are completely dependent on cash. The sudden decision to stop circulation of high-value notes has severely affected the lives of the poor, labourers and daily wage earners, especially in the unorganised sector, they rued. The move has affected the livelihood of street vendors, small merchants, vegetable merchants, hawkers and rickshaw pullers, autorickshaw drivers, craftsmen, farmers, and agriculture labourers. Farming and service sectors and industries have been affected. The functioning of cooperative societies in rural areas too has been hit, they alleged. Modi’s claim Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s claim that demonetisation will flush out black money is not based on facts as cash consists of five to six per cent of the black money. The rest is in the form of land, properties, gold, jewellery, shares, and other investments. There is a growing fear that the huge cash flows in banks after demonetisation would be used only to help banks recover non-performing assets, and not for growth. The PM’s demand for bearing with the hardships for the next 50-100 days is difficult for the poor to agree to, they added. Inadequate preparation by the government has led to nearly 100 deaths, they said. The former Prime Minister Manmohan Sing is therefore convinced that demonetisation is a case of “organised loot and legalised plunder”, they said. Mr. Modi’s claim that 94 per cent of the people welcomed demonetisation is false as nearly four lakh people are said to have lost their jobs, the memorandum stated, adding that the poor and middle classes were suffering owing to demonetisation.

A Division Bench of Justices S. Nagamuthu and M.V. Muralidaran declined a request made by Assistant Solicitor General G.R. Swaminathan to defer the hearing in both the PIL petitions to next week since the Supreme Court was slated to take up for hearing on December 2 an application preferred by the Centre last week to get transferred to the apex court all cases pending before various High Courts in the country with respect to demonetisation. Concern Pointing out that the application had already been listed for admission on Wednesday, the judges pointed out that the apex court had refused to stay the proceedings before various High Courts. “If what was reported in the newspapers is right, then the Supreme Court had also said that the High Courts are free to decide the cases on their own. Then, why should we adjourn these cases. We are concerned with the money in court custody,” Mr. Justice Nagamuthu said. Before posting the case related to demonetised money in court custody for hearing on Wednesday and the PIL petition, filed by ‘Agri’ K.P.T. Ganesan, against Rs.2,000 notes to Friday, the judge said that around Rs.5.8 crore was in the custody of courts in Kanniyakumari, Tirunelveli, Thoothukudi, Madurai, Dindigul, Theni, Ramanathapuram, Virudhunagar, Sivaganga, Pudukkottai, Thanjavur, Tiruchirappalli and Karur districts. Of that amount, the courts in Karur district alone had demonetised Rs.500 notes worth Rs.6.4 lakh and Rs.1,000 notes worth Rs.44.09 lakh. Proposal “Come up with some proposal for handling these notes. Reserve Bank of India should say how to go about with the money. We are responsible for returning the money to the owners after the conclusion of trial in criminal cases. It is mostly the money of victims in robbery, theft and other criminal cases. “Even if we say that we will not return the demonetised notes to the parties, they will have to be compensated. We want to save only legal money in court custody,” the judge told the ASG.

Addressing students of Woxsen School of Business at its campus in Munipally mandal on Tuesday evening, head of the global business conglomerate said: “For many politicians, money power is the lifeline. Cash is king in Indian politics.” “Payments to workers, wages for people to attend political rallies/meetings, distribution of gifts to lure voters, feeding them are part of that. Candidates and or parties use money collected from undisclosed sources. Nearly three-quarters of incomes of political parties is collected from undisclosed sources,” he explained. Demonetisation could be the death knell for political parties and politicians. Prime Minister Modi is the new disrupter in Indian politics, he said. “Disruptions have happened in so many fields, but, this is the first time we will witness disruption in politics,” the former MP said, according to a release here on Wednesday. Mr. Dalmia said decision to demonetise old Rs. 500 and Rs 1,000 notes will radically alter the political landscape. It has the potential of cleaning up the monetary system of the country, he added. Answering a question, if ease of doing business really changed as claimed by the government, Mr. Dalmia replied that the ease of doing business has not changed so much and the red tapism and bureaucracy continues to prevail.

  The Hubballi-Dharwad Municipal Corporation (HDMC) has collected Rs. 16 crore as tax in the last 20 days after demonetisation of high-value currency, HDMC commissioner Siddalingaiah Hiremath has said. Replying to a query by Yasin Haveripeth, councillor, at the general body meeting here on Wednesday, Mr. Hiremath said that before demonetisation, only 40 per cent of the tax collection target had been met. As tax payers were allowed to use old currency, there had been a hike in collection. A sum of Rs 8.18 crore had been collected as property tax; Rs. 1.6 crore as stallage fee; Rs. 70 lakh as property tax through cheque; and Rs. 2.3 crore as water cess in Hubballi and Rs. 1.4 crore in Dharwad. “Now, the HDMC has extended the period of paying taxes through old Rs. 500 notes till December 15 and the amount is likely to go up,” he said. Nearly 40 per cent of shopkeepers had not paid their taxes and now 150 were visiting the HDMC to pay their pending taxes in instalments. The remaining defaulters had been told to pay by December 15. “The HDMC had set a target to collect Rs. 9 crore as stallage fee, of which Rs. 3 crore had been collected so far and the remaining is expected to be collected in a fortnight,” he said. Members of all political parties condemned HDMC officials for not carrying out works on filling potholes. Lower cadre officials had not been cooperating with senior officials and directions from the commissioner had not been implemented, they said. The meeting also decided to waive the interest charged on pending water bills to help the poor. Member Deepak Chinchore said that he had spoken to the Chief Minister and the government was ready to pay the amount. Mr. Hiremath said the HDMC would waive the interest levied on pending water bills and the people might now pay only the water cess.

If that was the case, at least 100 candidates from that party would have been elected as council chief, which did not happen,” said an editorial in Sena mouthpiece Saamna. The Sena, which shares power with the BJP in the State and at the Centre, took a swipe at the BJP for having its campaign spearheaded by Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis, saying, in contrast, Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray or any of the party leaders did not engage in the poll campaign. “We wanted to instill confidence into our workers that they can fight the money-based campaign, which we succeeded. Our win assumes significance as we, in a bid to get the required numbers, did not engage in any unholy alliance,” it said, adding this makes the party’s win pure. “We did not adopt the approach of dampening the morale of our party workers by allying with parties against whom we levelled charges of corruptions.” Had the Sena entered into backdoor alliances with parties like the Congress, NCP, and the AIMIM, it too could have got more, the editorial said. The BJP emerged as the largest party in the first leg of the poll with 893 councillors, followed by the Congress, NCP, and the Sena, who won 727, 615 and 529 seats.

We know the sudden shift from manual to e-transactions will lead to initial hiccups for many of them. To address this challenge, we have trained our staff first, who, in turn, are expected to provide necessary guidance to the customers,” Mr. Sandeep said. Stating that the society accepted deposits worth Rs. 250 crore so far, he said that the transformation into the electronic mode would help them render better services to the customers. “We are also creating awareness about the need for filing income tax returns in time and even convened an interactive session with the senior officials of the department recently,” he said.

881,2016-11-30,23.0,Currency crisis keeps bankers guessing,"Finding currency of lower denomination is proving to be a challenge for many bankers.
  The supply of new currency notes has kept most bankers guessing, with banks getting just enough supplies to meet day-to-day requirements. However, most bankers in Kochi ruled out any issues on salary day owing to a possible rush of customers to withdraw money. Nearly all the 230 currency chests in the State have no currency stocks as notes received from the RBI are being disbursed to customers on a daily basis. In some cases, bankers have been requesting customers to limit their withdrawals to less than the permitted Rs.24,000 a week, sources said. Officials with a bank, which received supplies of Rs.50 crore worth currency notes on Wednesday, said the quantum was enough for a day or two, and that fresh supplies were expected. The bank, which has around 110 ATMs in Kochi, replenished all of them on Wednesday. However, low-denomination currency notes are not available, sources said. Of the Rs.50 crore received, nearly Rs.1 crore came in small denominations. Most ATMs are disbursing Rs.2,000 notes. A banker said the paucity of smaller denomination notes was a noticeable feature of transactions during the week. According to a hotel proprietor, small businesses like his has been hit hard by the paucity of low-denomination notes as it involved small amounts of cash transactions. A Union Bank of India official said banks were making special efforts to help people open accounts to ensure timely transfer of salaries. All banks have been paying special attention to problems facing the unbanked, and they are being helped out even amid the heavy work load owing to currency exchange and deposit business, the official added.

V.Sudershan Nobel Laureate Amartya Sen has called the Narendra Modi government’s demonetisation move “despotic action that has struck at the root of economy based on trust.” “It (demonetisation) undermines notes, it undermines bank accounts, it undermines the entire economy of trust. That is the sense in which it is despotic,” Prof. Sen told to a TV channel. He further said his immediate point of view on demonetisation is on its economic aspect. “It’s (demonetisation) a disaster on economy of trust. In the last 20 years, the country has been growing very fast. But it is all based on acceptance of each other’s word. By taking despotic action and saying we had promised but won’t fulfil our promise, you hit at the root of this,” Prof. Sen said. Noting that capitalism has many successes that have come from having trust in businesses, he said if a government promises in promissory notes and breaks such promise, then it is a despotic act. “I am not a great admirer of capitalism. On the other hand, capitalism has many successes... It’s despotic in the sense that if a government promises in promissory note that when given, we will give you this amount of compensation for it and to break such a promise is a despotic action,” Sen, who is currently Thomas W Lamont University Professor at Harvard University, said. The demonetisation issue has also rocked Parliament as both Houses have been witnessing disruptions and adjournments due to noisy protests by Opposition parties for the past several days.

The demonetisation move has brought the construction activity across the rural areas to a standstill, throwing thousands out of jobs and without money. The construction sites in rural areas of Bahour, Villianur, Mannadipet communes sported a deserted look. “After the Rs. 500 and Rs. 1000 notes became invalid, nobody wants to spend money. When there is work, we get Rs. 600 daily. But, no one has called us for work in the past three weeks,” said D. Sitrarasu, a mason, in Bahour. The mason said he had to pledge gold to pay his child’s hostel fees and had to borrow money to meet the family’s daily expenses. “There are thousands of construction workers in Bahour commune who are facing the same situation,” he says. Considered to be the rice bowl of Puducherry, thousands of farm labourers from the Bahour commune moved to the construction industry as the real estate gobbled up the agriculture fields. “Nearly two-thirds of the 20,000 odd hectares of agricultural fields had been converted into housing plots. Agricultural labourers and those owning small plots of land have been moving away from the villages looking for odd jobs in the town. Many work as construction labourers. The demonetisation has hit us really hard,” says K.Kaliyan, a construction labourer, who is unable to cultivate his one-acre land due to delay in monsoon. Th few farmers who continue to cultivate land are just hoping that this phase would pass soon. “There is no money in the five nationalised bank branches in our area. With Rs. 2,000 notes which we got earlier, we are unable to buy anything. The Central government has taken this step to curb black money and hope it succeeds in the endeavour. We hope that we will get money in a few days,” says Kaliyamurthy, who is busy planting groundnuts in his field. Merchants suffer V.Ramanujam, a paddy merchant, looked worried as he narrated the loss he has incurred in the last three weeks. “I am unable to sell paddy bags as the buyers do not have enough cash to pay me. Because of this, I have not paid the labourers who are working on my farms. Hence, I participated in the recent protest against the demonetisation move,” he added.

Dheenadayalan, working partner of the company, said that the group’s business was largely based on cash transactions. “Traders found it difficult to take delivery of consignment from us due to the shortage of lower denomination currencies,” he said.

Traders owing allegiance to the Tamil Nadu Vanigar Sangankalin Peramaippu staged a protest here on Tuesday urging the Centre to take necessary measures to revive business, which they said had been crippled due to the demonetisation. Raising slogans in support of their demands, the traders wanted the Centre to retrieve black money that was stashed abroad. The nearly 45-minute long demonstration at Chinthamani was led by the Peravai district president V. Sridhar. The traders’ body claimed that the Centre had demonetised Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,000 currency notes to eliminate black money without proper planning. Traders were unable to take the demonetised notes from customers and unable to withdraw money from the banks. Trade and business activity had plummeted due to the demonetisation announcement and was yet to revive. Amidst this situation, the Central government has been imposing new conditions forcing the traders to fight against the actions of the Centre, it further said. While demanding the Centre to find a proper solution to the hardship faced by the people and traders in view of the demonetisation announcement, the Peravai urged the government to relax the strict conditions imposed on cash deposits and withdrawals. The Centre should also take steps to ensure that the new Rs. 2,000 and Rs. 500 currency notes were in adequate circulation, they demanded. Thanjavur Bitterly complaining that all trading activities have come to a standstill due to the restrictions placed in withdrawing money from bank accounts, members of the Federation of Tamil Nadu Traders' Associations staged a protest demonstration against the Central Government in front of the Thanjavur Railway Junction here on Tuesday. The traders claim that their businesses have been severely hit because of the demonetisation of Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,000 announced by the Central Government. While the common man has not been able to purchase anything other than essentials with the amount he is entitled to withdraw from the ATMs a day or in withdrawals from the banks, the traders were also stifled by the ceiling on withdrawals imposed by the Reserve Bank of India and the Central Government. All those have crippled the trading activities, the traders averred. Speakers at the demonstration demanded that the Centre repeal all restrictions on withdrawals by the public and wanted the traders and small and medium industries to draw up to Rs. 2 lakh a week to meet their expenses.

Contrary to expectations, the contributions were mostly not made online in the urban areas. “There was cash and sometimes cheques. Online contributions were low,” said project co-ordinator Sreeraj N. The funds are being collected by the ward councillors and registered at the Corporation office before being deposited in the Snehasparsam bank account. In most wards, the collection is yet to be concluded.

It brought alive the 14th century ruler from the pages of history as he sets out to gather information about demonetisation. The play first staged in Kozhikode had since then been staged in Malappuram and Kannur. “Kochi was our fourth venue and we plan to stage it across all 14 districts,” said Mr. Vijayan.

  Blaming the two UPA governments for using asset inflation as the driver of growth, economic and political commentator S. Gurumurthy on Tuesday said that demonetisation was a planned contraction that would make real growth possible. Mr. Gurumurthy, who is also the Distinguished Research Professor of Legal Anthropology at SASTRA University, was delivering the 13th Nani Palkhivala Memorial Lecture, organised by the School of Law at the University. “Without breaking the hold of asset inflation and wealth-influenced jobless growth, there is no real growth possible,” he said. His analysis was founded on the premise that under the then Finance Minister P. Chidambaram, the gains made during the NDA regime of 1999-2004 was lost. “It is a very important point that, the background for this analysis has to start from the movement of the Indian economy from 1999 – how it took an elitist turn based on the experiences of countries like America. Because of that, we destabilised our own economy,” he said. Mr. Gurumurthy called 1999-2004 the ‘Golden Era of the Indian Economy’. He said that 60 million jobs had been created during those five years, as opposed to 27 lakh jobs in the next six years. “It happened because of the huge surge of unmonitored cash in the economy which propelled gold prices, which rose 316 times,” he said. The price of property also rose and the stock market went up four times. “Participatory notes pushed up the stock market, cash pushed up gold and cash pushed up property. This is known as asset inflation, which leads to wealth effect. This wealth effect is what is reflected in the high growth of GDP,” he said, adding that banknotes of the Rs. 1,000 and Rs. 500 denominations constituted 34 per cent of the cash supply in 2004, but rose to 87 per cent later. An RBI study had shown that two-thirds of all Rs. 1,000 and one-thirds of all Rs. 500 banknotes were not in circulation: “Money, instead of a flow, had become store value.” Piketty effect Mr. Gurumurthy cited the work of French economist Thomas Piketty to say that the economic growth during 2004-2014 did not improve the lives of the poor. “This has nothing to do with economic activities which will benefit people less than the higher 10 or 15 per cent of the population. This is known as the Piketty effect...this has nothing to do with the ordinary people. What was happening legally in Europe was happening illegally through the huge cash surge in the Indian economy,” he said. Among the benefits will be a fall in the price of land, which will enable a growth in the housing sector. “Never in the history of economics, a contraction like this has been deliberately planned...They (economists) say that crisis is inevitable; you ask any economist, he will say, ‘Crisis is correction’. You can’t correct ahead of the correction?...Narendra Modi preponed the crisis to handle it,” he contended. He had harsh words for economists who have raised concerns about the policy. “If [former United States Secretary of Treasury] Larry Summers writes about India, he is completely illiterate...He doesn’t know how mandis operate. He doesn’t know how Koyambedu [wholesale market] operates. We operate on an entirely different grammar,” said Mr. Gurumurthy. He, however, warned that the government should move to help small- and medium-scale enterprises. “The most important challenge which the Modi government will face is how to finance the small and medium enterprises, a large number of which were being financed by cash,” he said. S. Mahalingam, former chief financial officer at Tata Consultancy Services and non-executive chairman of City Union Bank, moderated the discussion.

Over 1,000 traders assembled under the leadership of the federation president A.M. Vikramaraja in front of State Guest House in Chepauk. They shouted slogans against the Central government, accusing it of destroying the retail sector. The traders demanded that the Centre ensure the supply of notes of Rs. 500.

891,2016-11-30,23.0,?Realty unaffected by demonetisation?,"Despite the fall in the number of land registrations post demonetisation, city realtors representing CREDAI (Confederation of Real Estate Developers Association of India) claimed that the sector remains unaffected following the ban on higher currency notes. According to CREDAI members, 95 per cent of the Hyderabad market consists of mid segment housing and the buyers are mostly employees who avail property loans. Since there is no cash component in the transaction, the demonetisation has no effect on prices of residential housing, they said. The members also said that most of the credible builders are taking loans from banks and also entering in to joint agreements with plot-owners leaving no scope for the use of cash in the construction projects. S Ram Reddy, President, CREDAI Hyderabad said the demonetisation will benefit the sector as housing loans can get slashed from existing 9 per cent to 6.5 to 7 per cent due to the huge inflows to the banks. “The much awaited RERA (Real Estate Regulation Act) bill will come into force from May 2017 and there is going to be short supply of housing stock in the market and as a consequence of this shortage, the real estate prices will go up. Also, the effect of a GST coming into effect from April 2017 is that the prices would increase on account of non-availability of a service tax set off as well as increase in the rate of tax rate,” Mr. Reddy said. He predicted that the property prices might increase by 10 to 12 per cent after the implementation of RERA and GST and advised people to buy property soon. P Ramakrishna Rao, General Secretary, CREDAI Hyderabad said that the usage of cash will become minimal during transaction in purchase of open plots and second hand homes due to demonetisation. He was also confident that the property prices in the city will not decrease. The CREDAI members informed that they will give representation to the government for reduction of stamp duty and also income tax on capital gains so that the cash component is further reduced in real estate transactions owing to the lower taxations.

C. Venkatachalapathy Bankers are preparing for another hectic spell over the next few days as salaries and pensions will get credited from Wednesday even as many branches, particularly in the urban areas, were closed on Tuesday after they ran out of cash. The Indian Banks Association (IBA) has issued an advisory to banks to maintain adequate cash in view of the rush at the beginning of the month and maintain normality. However, bankers said the supply of cash was much lower than the demand. “Since Rs. 500 and Rs. 100 notes are only being printed now, branches and automated teller machines are running out of cash frequently,” said the chief executive of a public sector bank. Printing presses have stopped printing Rs 2000 notes for the time being, several bankers pointed out. Several bank CEOs told The Hindu that as many as 50 per cent of the branches of various banks in some metro cities run out of cash. Bankers said since they have to disburse Rs 35,000 crore to the rural centres by middle of December in view of the rabi harvest season, urban centres are facing shortage of currency supply. Some bank branches have started rationing cash disbursement, allowing individuals to withdraw only Rs 5,000 or Rs 10,000, against the Rs 24,000 weekly limit set by the Reserve Bank of India. “We were seeing a huge demand for cash everyday from our bank. If you add the demand for salary, pension withdrawals as well as demand for farmers ahead of rabi season, the amount will certainly go up. Supply of cash remains an issue,” said another top official of a large public sector bank. To substitute the demand for additional cash, banks have started offering prepaid cards, another chief executive of a south India-based bank said. “We are trying to convince our customers to accept a part of the amount in prepaid cards,” the banker said. Banks were installing point-of-sale terminals in a big way to enable cashless transaction. The government wants banks to install three million terminals over the next three months. There were over 14 million PoS terminals in the country as of end August, RBI data showed.

893,2016-11-30,23.0,Demonetisation hits Maoists,"When Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced the demonetisation scheme on November 8, he gave many reasons on why the higher denominations of ₹ 500 and ₹ 1,000 ceased to be legal tenders. And primary among them was to hit the black money market and the extremist organisations such as the Maoists. While it is still to ascertain how much black money has come under the tax fold, but there are clear indications that demonetisation has hit the Maoists hard. Top sources in the police say that the Maoists located in the jungles of Chhattisgarh, Odisha and Andhra-Odisha-Border (AOB) areas are desperate to get the crores of rupees that are stashed in the dumps exchanged for the new currency. Visakhapatnam (Range) DIG Ch. Srikanth informed The Hindu that the Maoists are desperately trying to rope in contractors and ganja smugglers to get the old notes exchanged. While a few cases were detected in Chhattisgarh and Odisha, so far no case has been detected on the Andhra side. “A few contractors were taken into custody in Chhattisgarh and Odisha, when they tried to exchange the old notes and some gold belonging to the Maoists. Recently, a man was taken into custody in Kondagaon, a municipality in Chhattisgarh, when he was moving suspiciously near a bank with some unaccounted cash of about ₹ 44 lakh, in old currency of ₹ 500 and ₹ 1,000 in denominations, and some gold coins worth about ₹ 2 lakh. On interrogation he disclosed that the Maoists had given them for exchange,” said a senior officer from the APSIB, who looks after counter-insurgency in the Andhra-Odisha-Border region. According to the officer, the actual wealth or cash reserve of the Maoists is not clearly known but a report from Chhattisgarh intelligence suggest that they (Maosits) have about ₹ 6,000 to ₹ 6,500 crore in cash and gold stashed in dumps in the ‘red corridor’ area in Chhattisgarh alone. Mr. Srikanth pointed out that the rough estimated annual income of the Maoists in the AOB region could range between ₹ 300 to ₹ 400 crore. “Till about five to seven year ago it was about ₹ 120 to ₹ 150 crore, but with the ganja smuggling taking the centre-stage and Maoists having a cut in it, it is estimated that income could have crossed ₹ 300 crore,” he said. Basically, the income of the Left Wing Extremists (LWE) is through extortion from the contractors and cut from the ganja smugglers. “Extortion is the main source,” said Narsipatnam OSD A. Babujee. Stashing Till about a few years ago, the Left Wing Extremists were stashing the cash collected in dumps located at safe places. In earlier raids at the dumps, the police have found cash ranging from ₹ 4 to ₹ 7 lakh along with arms and literature, a number of times. But off late, due to various factors such as the notes getting spoilt over a period of time, the Maoists have shifted their strategy and were converting the cash into gold coins. A contractor was caught at Ralagedda in Visakhapatnam agency in 2015 and the police recovered about 2 kg of gold coins from him. Strict vigil Strict vigil at the banks and an eye over the contractors and habitual ganja offenders in the region by the AP police is forcing the Maoists to move the cash to safer places in Chhattisgarh and Odisha. And it is increasingly becoming difficult in those States also with every passing day and that has created a desperate situation for the Left Wing Extremists, said Mr. Babujee. Police have nexus with smugglers: Maoists Meanwhile, the spokesperson of the banned CPI (Maoist) released a letter accusing the police of having a nexus with the ganja smugglers. The letter was released in the name of one Kailasam, secretary of the East Division Committee of the banned outfit, here on Tuesday. In the letter, the Maoist leader decried the efforts made by the police to tarnish the revolutionary image of the Left Wing Extremists by calling them supporters of ganja smugglers and accusing them (Maoists) of having a cut in the smuggling activity. As per the letter, all senior police officers in the district in turn have an understanding with the smugglers and are recipients of huge kickbacks.

894,2016-11-30,23.0,Theft in the time of demonetisation,"Thieves know what’s valuable and they surely have realised that Rs.500 and Rs.1,000 notes are definitely not. Since the day the Union government announced demonetisation, there has been a sharp fall in the number of thefts and burglary involving loss of cash in the district. According to police officials, only one major case of burglary has been reported from the district in the past two weeks. In Kizhakkambalam, the thieves struck the home of a businessman and stole around 57 sovereigns of gold and Rs.1 lakh as cash, kept in the form of old currencies. “May be they are hoping to get the old notes exchanged from banks over a period of time,” a top officer with the Ernakulam Rural police said. Meanwhile, the police are now examining whether the currency notes stolen from an apartment in Ernakulam North belonged to the demonetised category. As per a complaint, burglars broke into the apartment, owned by a Rajasthan native, and decamped with 1.75 kilograms of gold, in addition to cash worth Rs.3.5 lakh. After a much-hyped beginning, the functioning of the special squad constituted to check organised criminal activities in Kochi appears to have hit a roadblock. While Zakir Husain, a CPI(M) leader accused in a kidnap case, surrendered after 22 days, the police failed to trace three others - Sheela Thomas, Antony Ashamparambil and Jilson Peter - accused in two separate cases. “The police have no other option but to wait as they have been moving from court to court, seeking anticipatory bail,” said a top official with the Kochi city police. It’s been nearly a month since the police booked these individuals, in two separate cases of kidnap and threatening. Though several persons were arrested in connection with the case, they are still at large and the police are unable to trace them. Officials in the lower rung are of the view that the police should not have waited this long to arrest them. “It seems the police are afraid of their political clout,” they said.

895,2016-11-30,23.0,Currency crisis hits sheep traders hard,"Bala tal gayi (the worst is over), says Sunny Khatik, a sheep trader from Jabalpur in Madhya Pradesh about how the demonetisation of Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,000 currency notes has affected his business. Inside the sheep/goat market in Ziyaguda, the mood is shifting from deep gloom to sombre reality among the farmers, shepherds, butchers and traders. “The business was nearly zero for 15 days. Now it is looking up and in another 15 days things will get back to normal,” says Mr. Khatik. But, not everyone shares the bright picture painted by the man from MP. The sheep market in Ziyaguda is a mini India. Spread over a vast area, it is a daily market with traders from Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan, Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh coming to buy and sell animals. “Everyday we used to trade in two or three truck loads of sheep with each carrying about 250 animals. But now, the business is down and we are managing to sell only one truck load per day. This will have a big effect on farmers as they will have to take care of the animals with nothing in return,” says Ushakiran a wholesale dealer. “People are no longer serving meat in marriages and I have not had work for the past eight days,” says Narsing, a butcher for hire, who gets Rs. 300 to Rs. 400 per lamb he processes in the Ring Road Crossroad area. Ironically, the price of meat or animals has not declined due to demonetisation. Hyderabad gets sheep from nearby places like Shadnagar, Mahbubnagar, Sircilla, Kaikoor, etc. Due to this currency crisis many of the villagers are not coming to the market with their sheep. There is immense pressure on them to take old currency notes and that is one of the reasons they are keeping away, points out Akbar, who trades in goats in the Toli Masjid area. A butcher for hire, Ramlal accepts the old currency notes as he doesn’t have a choice and can deposit them into his bank account. The problem is with big traders, who have stopped using the currency and cut down on purchases affecting the whole market. On Sundays, Ramlal hailing from Langar Houz, used to deal with four or five sheep, but over the past 20 days, he had slaughtered only seven animals. “You can imagine the situation at home,” says Ramlal.

896,2016-11-30,23.0,Deposits rise even before demonetisation,"Deposits in commercial banks in the district have shown an increase of nearly 10 per cent during the current fiscal even before demonetisation announced. The credit off take in priority sectors too showed an increase, exceeding the Annual Credit Plan target during the first half of the current financial year. The official statistics obtained by The Hindu shows that deposits in the banks stood at Rs. 14,911.11 crore at the end of the first half of the current fiscal – September 30 – as against Rs. 13,637 crore on March 31, 2016. Lead District Manager S. Sundaramoorthy attributes the increase in the deposits to the rising faith of people in banks as a safe destination to keep their savings. “The confidence levels have gone up primarily because of various cheating incidents reported in the district. Many have been duped by certain institutions after collecting deposits offering attractive interest rates,” he said. The credit flow to priority sectors like agriculture and MSMEs has shown an increase too. The total disbursement during the first half of the current financial year was of Rs. 4,465 crore against a target of Rs. 4,383 crore. Despite a weak monsoon, the loan disbursement to agriculture sector stood at 103 per cent of the target. Bank officials say that the loans were taken to sink more borewells, replace the old water distribution pipelines, and for preparation of land for rabi sowing. The credit flow to MSME sector stood at 101 per cent during first half of the fiscal. “Currency was reasonably fairing well and also government gave rebate on State levies like Value Added Tax to the tune of 3.2 per cent, which enthused garment manufacturers to take loans to execute more orders,” said S. Dhananjayan, a chartered accountant and industry consultant.

Bhatt has said. Mr. Bhatt told The Hindu here on Tuesday that bank employees across the country were happy that Prime Minister Narendra Modi had acknowledged their dedicated service during the post-demonetisation days. ‘Educate people’ The SBSA leader called upon the bank employees to reject any kind of agitation against demonetisation and enlighten the common man about its merits. It was unfortunate that certain union leaders appeared to be against bringing in any sort of control on cooperative banks, Mr. Bhatt alleged. He said it was not correct to state that demonetisation had not affected most businessmen as they used the overdraft facility to launder black money. “Any remittance over Rs.50,000 invariably requires the Permanent Account Number, lest the system will not accept it, and hence such arguments are baseless and politically motivated,’’ he added. Mr. Bhatt alleged that certain trade unions were trying to misguide the employees as well as the public through such baseless statements. Their arguments that the demonetisation should have been declared with adequate arrangements and also that the Reserve Bank of India had failed to print enough Rs.100 and Rs.500 denomination notes were aimed at furthering their political agenda, he said.

They said the demonetisation of Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,000 currency notes that came into force without any precautionary steps taken to assuage the problems being encountered by traders and the common man had derailed trading completely. Though new Rs. 2,000 currency note was released it failed to check the magnitude of the problem. Situation worsened The absence of new 500 rupee note for financial transactions and the non-availability of Rs. 100 and Rs. 50 notes made the situation from bad to worse. “Moreover, the restrictions imposed on withdrawal of cash from the current and savings bank account have hit the public, especially the traders. Hence, the Central Government that miserably failed to foresee the impact of demonetisation should expedite the remedial measures,” the speakers at the protest venue stressed.

Chidambaram, the gains made during the NDA regime of 1999-2004 was lost. “It is a very important point that, the background for this analysis has to start from the movement of the Indian economy from 1999 – how it took an elitist turn based on the experiences of countries like America. Because of that, we destabilised our own economy,” he said. Mr. Gurumurthy called 1999-2004 the ‘Golden Era of the Indian Economy’. He said that 60 million jobs had been created during those five years, as opposed to 27 lakh jobs in the next six years. “It happened because of the huge surge of unmonitored cash in the economy which propelled gold prices, which rose 316 times,” he said. The price of property also rose and the stock market went up four times. “Participatory notes pushed up the stock market, cash pushed up gold and cash pushed up property. This is known as asset inflation, which leads to wealth effect. This wealth effect is what is reflected in the high growth of GDP,” he said, adding that banknotes of the Rs. 1,000 and Rs. 500 denominations constituted 34 per cent of the cash supply in 2004, but rose to 87 per cent later. An RBI study had shown that two-thirds of all Rs. 1,000 and one-thirds of all Rs. 500 banknotes were not in circulation: “Money, instead of a flow, had become store value.” Piketty effect Mr. Gurumurthy cited the work of French economist Thomas Piketty to say that the economic growth during 2004-2014 did not improve the lives of the poor. “This has nothing to do with economic activities which will benefit people less than the higher 10 or 15 per cent of the population. This is known as the Piketty effect...this has nothing to do with the ordinary people. What was happening legally in Europe was happening illegally through the huge cash surge in the Indian economy,” he said. Among the benefits will be a fall in the price of land, which will enable a growth in the housing sector. “Never in the history of economics, a contraction like this has been deliberately planned...They (economists) say that crisis is inevitable; you ask any economist, he will say, ‘Crisis is correction’. You can’t correct ahead of the correction?...Narendra Modi preponed the crisis to handle it,” he contended. He had harsh words for economists who have raised concerns about the policy. “If [former United States Secretary of Treasury] Larry Summers writes about India, he is completely illiterate...He doesn’t know how mandis operate. He doesn’t know how Koyambedu [wholesale market] operates. We operate on an entirely different grammar,” said Mr. Gurumurthy. He, however, warned that the government should move to help small- and medium-scale enterprises. “The most important challenge which the Modi government will face is how to finance the small and medium enterprises, a large number of which were being financed by cash,” he said. S. Mahalingam, former chief financial officer at Tata Consultancy Services and non-executive chairman of City Union Bank, moderated the discussion. ‘There’s huge surge of unmonitored cash. Money, instead of a flow, had become store value’ Printable version | Jan 7, 2017 1:39:36 AM | http://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/%E2%80%98Demonetisation-will-end-UPA%E2%80%99s-asset-inflation-driven-growth%E2%80%99/article16743621.ece © The Hindu The cyclone wreaked havoc on the city throwing normal life out of gear.

The demonetisation move has brought the construction activity across the rural areas to a standstill, throwing thousands out of jobs and without money. The construction sites in rural areas of Bahour, Villianur, Mannadipet communes sported a deserted look. “After the Rs. 500 and Rs. 1000 notes became invalid, nobody wants to spend money. When there is work, we get Rs. 600 daily. But, no one has called us for work in the past three weeks,” said D. Sitrarasu, a mason, in Bahour. The mason said he had to pledge gold to pay his child’s hostel fees and had to borrow money to meet the family’s daily expenses. “There are thousands of construction workers in Bahour commune who are facing the same situation,” he says. Considered to be the rice bowl of Puducherry, thousands of farm labourers from the Bahour commune moved to the construction industry as the real estate gobbled up the agriculture fields. “Nearly two-thirds of the 20,000 odd hectares of agricultural fields had been converted into housing plots. Agricultural labourers and those owning small plots of land have been moving away from the villages looking for odd jobs in the town. Many work as construction labourers. The demonetisation has hit us really hard,” says K.Kaliyan, a construction labourer, who is unable to cultivate his one-acre land due to delay in monsoon. Th few farmers who continue to cultivate land are just hoping that this phase would pass soon. “There is no money in the five nationalised bank branches in our area. With Rs. 2,000 notes which we got earlier, we are unable to buy anything. The Central government has taken this step to curb black money and hope it succeeds in the endeavour. We hope that we will get money in a few days,” says Kaliyamurthy, who is busy planting groundnuts in his field. Merchants suffer V.Ramanujam, a paddy merchant, looked worried as he narrated the loss he has incurred in the last three weeks. “I am unable to sell paddy bags as the buyers do not have enough cash to pay me. Because of this, I have not paid the labourers who are working on my farms. Hence, I participated in the recent protest against the demonetisation move,” he added.

904,2016-11-30,23.0,"Realty unaffected by demonetisation, say CREDAI members","Despite the fall in the number of land registrations post demonetisation, city realtors representing CREDAI (Confederation of Real Estate Developers Association of India) claimed that the sector remains unaffected following the ban on higher currency notes. According to CREDAI members, 95 per cent of the Hyderabad market consists of mid segment housing and the buyers are mostly employees who avail property loans. Since there is no cash component in the transaction, the demonetisation has no effect on prices of residential housing, they said. The members also said that most of the credible builders are taking loans from banks and also entering in to joint agreements with plot-owners leaving no scope for the use of cash in the construction projects. S Ram Reddy, President, CREDAI Hyderabad said the demonetisation will benefit the sector as housing loans can get slashed from existing 9 per cent to 6.5 to 7 per cent due to the huge inflows to the banks. “The much awaited RERA (Real Estate Regulation Act) bill will come into force from May 2017 and there is going to be short supply of housing stock in the market and as a consequence of this shortage, the real estate prices will go up. Also, the effect of a GST coming into effect from April 2017 is that the prices would increase on account of non-availability of a service tax set off as well as increase in the rate of tax rate,” Mr. Reddy said. He predicted that the property prices might increase by 10 to 12 per cent after the implementation of RERA and GST and advised people to buy property soon. P Ramakrishna Rao, General Secretary, CREDAI Hyderabad said that the usage of cash will become minimal during transaction in purchase of open plots and second hand homes due to demonetisation. He was also confident that the property prices in the city will not decrease. The CREDAI members informed that they will give representation to the government for reduction of stamp duty and also income tax on capital gains so that the cash component is further reduced in real estate transactions owing to the lower taxations.

The fund raising for the rural areas held on November 13 received luke warm response as most people did not have cash to contribute for charity. The Society had to extend the dates to November 20 for the convenience of the contributors, which however earned good results. The second phase of the fund raising was held in the urban belt including Kozhikode Corporation and Feroke municipality. Contrary to expectations, the contributions were mostly not made online in the urban areas. “There was cash and sometimes cheques. Online contributions were low,” said project co-ordinator Sreeraj N.

A Division Bench of Justices S. Nagamuthu and M.V. Muralidaran declined a request made by Assistant Solicitor General G.R. Swaminathan to defer the hearing in both the PIL petitions to next week since the Supreme Court was slated to take up for hearing on December 2 an application preferred by the Centre last week to get transferred to the apex court all cases pending before various High Courts in the country with respect to demonetisation. Pointing out that the application had already been listed for admission on Wednesday, the judges pointed out that the apex court had refused to stay the proceedings before various High Courts. “If what was reported in the newspapers is right, then the Supreme Court had also said that the High Courts are free to decide the cases on their own. Then, why should we adjourn these cases. We are concerned with the money in court custody,” Mr. Justice Nagamuthu said. Before posting the case related to demonetised money in court custody for hearing on Wednesday and the PIL petition, filed by ‘Agri’ K.P.T.

Reserve Bank of India should say how to go about with the money. We are responsible for returning the money to the owners after the conclusion of trial in criminal cases. It is mostly the money of victims in robbery, theft and other criminal cases. “Even if we say that we will not return the demonetised notes to the parties, they will have to be compensated.

907,2016-11-30,23.0,Demonetisation has crippled business activities: Traders,"The trading community in Tiruchi came out strongly against the demonetisation of Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,000 currency notes stating that the Central government’s move has severely hit business ever since the announcement was made. Traders owing allegiance to the Tamil Nadu Vanigar Sangankalin Peramaippu staged a protest here on Tuesday urging the Centre to take necessary measures to revive business, which they said had been crippled due to the demonetisation. Raising slogans in support of their demands, the traders wanted the Centre to retrieve black money that was stashed abroad. The nearly 45-minute long demonstration at Chinthamani was led by the Peravai district president V. Sridhar. The traders’ body claimed that the Centre had demonetised Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,000 currency notes to eliminate black money without proper planning. Traders were unable to take the demonetised notes from customers and unable to withdraw money from the banks. Trade and business activity had plummeted due to the demonetisation announcement and was yet to revive. Amidst this situation, the Central government has been imposing new conditions forcing the traders to fight against the actions of the Centre, it further said. While demanding the Centre to find a proper solution to the hardship faced by the people and traders in view of the demonetisation announcement, the Peravai urged the government to relax the strict conditions imposed on cash deposits and withdrawals. The Centre should also take steps to ensure that the new Rs. 2,000 and Rs. 500 currency notes were in adequate circulation, they demanded. Thanjavur Bitterly complaining that all trading activities have come to a standstill due to the restrictions placed in withdrawing money from bank accounts, members of the Federation of Tamil Nadu Traders' Associations staged a protest demonstration against the Central Government in front of the Thanjavur Railway Junction here on Tuesday. The traders claim that their businesses have been severely hit because of the demonetisation of Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,000 announced by the Central Government. While the common man has not been able to purchase anything other than essentials with the amount he is entitled to withdraw from the ATMs a day or in withdrawals from the banks, the traders were also stifled by the ceiling on withdrawals imposed by the Reserve Bank of India and the Central Government. All those have crippled the trading activities, the traders averred. Speakers at the demonstration demanded that the Centre repeal all restrictions on withdrawals by the public and wanted the traders and small and medium industries to draw up to Rs. 2 lakh a week to meet their expenses.

The accused were identified as Chintha Trinada Rao, L. Siddarth and Manthagode post office postmaster G. Satyanarayana Chary. Mr. Trinada Rao, deputy project manager in Gaja Engineering Pvt. Ltd, was reportedly given the amount by Maoists and promised a sizeable amount in return, said Mahabubnagar Superintendent of Police Rema Rajeshwari. Rao was caught along with Siddarth, his assistant engineer, in Chary’s house with bundles of Rs. 500 and Rs. 1000 by the Makthal police on Thursday. Protection money Mr. Trinada Rao has been working in the Charla forests of Bhadradri-Kothgudem district on a project since 2015. In September, an unidentified person came to the project site, stopped the ongoing work by threatening workers with a weapon. A month later, another unidentified person came to Mr. Rao and reportedly delivered a letter from the CPI (Maoist) Khammam district secretary, asking him to come to the Maoist Martyr’s Stupa at Bheemavaram village in Chattisgarh on October 28. Mr. Rao, accompanied by Mr. Siddarth, went there and were taken to another location, three kilometres away, where, two armed Maoists met them, according to the police. The Maoist duo allegedly threatened Mr. Rao and demanded that he pay them 10 per cent commission from his ongoing projects, which worked out to some Rs.1.3 lakh. The project manager was asked to deliver the money to the extremists on November 12, by which time the demonetisation of high value currency notes came into effect. On the assigned day, Mr. Rao and Mr. Siddarth met the Maoists and handed over the amount in both old and new currency notes. Old currency The Maoists then gave Mr. Rao and Mr. Siddarth two bags with Rs.12 lakh in it, to exchange for new Rs.2000 notes. They convinced Rao to to cooperate, promising a commission too. Mr. Siddharth suggested to Mr. Rao that they meet his postmaster friend Mr. Chary, who agreed to convert the demonetised currency in return for a 15 per cent commission. However, their endeavour ended in nought, as they were all arrested. A case has been registered by the police against the three under sections 409, 420 of the IPC, read with Section 8(1)(2) of the Telangana State Public Securities Act, according to a press release.

911,2016-12-01,24.0,Carmakers brace for demonetisation impact,"currency jam: Demonetisation has hit the industry even as it had begun to see stability after an uncertain period.
  The auto industry is bracing for ‘short term headwinds’ due to ‘immediate disruption and uncertainty’ brought in by demonetisation, even as some carmakers posted double digit growth in domestic sales during November. Significantly, these figures reflect only the wholesale figures for the industry and not the retail sales reported by dealers. While players such as Maruti, Toyota and Volkswagen saw robust growth, automakers such as Mahindra, Ford and Honda saw their sales drop during the month. Market leader Maruti Suzuki said it sold more than 1.26 lakh units in the country last month, up 14.2 per cent from the same period last year. Domestic sales for Toyota Kirloskar Motor (TKM) rose 10.03 per cent to 11,309 units in November. N Raja, Director & Sr. VP(Sales & Marketing) at TKM said the firm had received more than 6,200 bookings for the new Fortuner, while Innova Crysta has clocked more than 50,000 units within six months of its launch. ‘Affected walk-ins’ “However, demonetisation has had its impact on our sales as it has affected customer walk-ins at dealerships, order bookings and timely deliveries. This will pose as a major challenge in the coming days as customers are still dealing with the effects of demonetisation,” Mr. Raja added. Likewise, domestic sales for homegrown auto major Tata Motors’ grew 22 per cent to 12,736 units, driven by strong demand for the Tata Tiago. “The limitation on cash availability due to the recent demonetisation has affected retails in the auto industry, this month,” said Mayank Pareek, President, Passenger Vehicle Business, Tata Motors. Volkswagen India reported a more than two-fold increase in sales to 4,014 units in November, while Renault posted 23 per cent rise in sales to 9,604 units. Mahindra & Mahindra said domestic sales in November declined 24.29 per cent to 29,814 units. “While we expected an improved auto industry performance on the back of the festive season and other positive parameters such as rural demand and interest rates softening, the sudden announcement of demonetisation has brought in disruption and uncertainty.” He added that this was significant as “the automotive industry had just started experiencing stability post a long and tough period of uncertainty,” Mr Shah said. Similarly, Anurag Mehrotra, Executive Director (Marketing, Sales & Service) Ford India, which saw domestic sales fall 21.62 per cent to 6,876 units, said, “While the macro-economic indicators continue to be positive, the auto industry does face short-term headwinds given the recent demonetisation drive.” The sales for Honda Cars India fell 45.42 per cent to 8,029 units. Its President and CEO Yoichiro Ueno said, “Consumer sentiment was low and footfalls and enquiries at the dealerships also slowed down during the month.” Among two-wheeler firms, India Yamaha Motor reported a 20 per cent increase in domestic sales at 51,106 units, while Honda Motorcycle and Scooter India’s sales growth was flat at 3.25 lakh units in and Royal Enfield’s domestic sales rose 39 per cent to 55,843 units. Wholesale figures Abdul Majeed, Partner at PwCsaid, “Demonetisation will have significant negative impact at least in the next two to three months especially (for) two-wheelers, SUVs, luxury and commercial vehicles.” He added that November sales do not reflect the ground reality of retail sales as manufacturers give out wholesale numbers.

  Demonetisation has adversely impacted manufacturing growth in November, according to a private sector survey, which added that manufacturing conditions nevertheless improved for the eleventh consecutive month. “The withdrawal of high-value banknotes in India reportedly hampered manufacturing growth in November, with companies signalling softer increases in order books, buying levels and output,” the Nikkei India Manufacturing Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) said. The headline figure for the PMI for India was 52.3 in November, with a reading over 50 indicating an expansion in activity. “However, down from October’s 22-month high of 54.4, the latest reading pointed to a modest upturn overall,” the report added. “PMI data for November showed that the sudden withdrawal of high-value banknotes in India caused problems for manufacturers, as cash shortages hampered growth of new work, buying activity and production,” Pollyanna De Lima, Economist at IHS Markit and author of the report said. “However, whereas some may have anticipated an outright downturn, the sector held its ground and remained in expansion mode.” The report said that the three sectors it monitored witnessed softer growth in November, with consumer goods producers recording a sharp slowdown in growth. However, the prevailing conditions could point towards further cuts in interest rates by the Reserve Bank of India. “Of respite to firms, cost inflationary pressures softened, which in turn encouraged the vast majority of businesses to keep their selling prices unchanged,” Mr De Lima said. “If this trend is sustained we will likely see further cuts to the benchmark rate.” Printable version | Jan 7, 2017 1:40:00 AM | http://www.thehindu.com/business/Economy/Manufacturing-PMI-down-in-November-on-demonetisation-effect/article16737922.ece © The Hindu Following the withdrawal of high-value currency notes, activity at PoS terminals saw exponential growth, even as the number of new such machines installed has also gone up."

Finance Department sources told The Hindu that of the 222 treasuries in the State, the State Bank of Travancore and the State Bank of India share the responsibility for providing cash in 188 treasuries, 144 and 44 respectively. The rest are being maintained by the others, mainly Canara Bank. The Reserve Bank of India earnestly met the cash demand of the treasuries in the cities and urban centres, allegedly neglecting the rural areas. The neglect of treasuries in northern Kerala as well as those in the rural areas has drawn flak. Cash shortage, in addition to the withdrawal curbs, have added to the woes of those who rely on the treasury for payments. Sustaining the cash supply during the next two days will be a challenge for the Reserve Bank of India. For a vast majority of private institutions, mainly shops and commercial establishments, will be disbursing salary within the next two days. Following complaints about private firms failing to honour their salary commitments, the Labour Department had taken the lead to route the payments through banks. Banks make the payments against the cheques issued by the employers. This will lead to a spurt in the demand for currency and also increase the pressure on the apex bank to replenish the chests to meet the demand. If the preparedness of the RBI on the first payment day is an indication, it will not be a smooth sail in the coming days, sources said. Since the government is not authorised to check or monitor the cash flow in banks directly, it will have to elicit information from the State-Level Bankers Committee. Finer details will be available only by the weekend. The crunch will again force the banks to lower the withdrawal limit from Rs.24,000 and customers may have to be contented with Rs.12,000 per week, the sources said.

914,2016-12-01,24.0,"GST, currency change to be game changers for economy: Jaitley"," Rejecting apprehensions that the Indian economy would suffer due to demonetisation, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley today termed as “game changers” the pulling out of high-value old notes as well as Goods and Services Tax, which is proposed to be rolled out from April 1. “I do believe that both (GST and demonetisation) will be game changers. This is because GST will ensure higher taxation as far as the Centre is concerned and also higher taxation for states. It is an efficient system. It blocks leakages. It will certainly help the consuming states like Odisha,” he said. Mr. Jaitley was speaking at the “Make in Odisha” conclave here. On the hue and cry over the demonetisation exercise, he said: “As far as currency changes are concerned, once the demonetisation process is completed and the economy gets back to full stream, the size of the GDP will significantly expand, tax base will expand.” He added, “More money will come to the banks which will be used fruitfully for the betterment of the economy.” Printable version | Jan 7, 2017 1:40:02 AM | http://www.thehindu.com/business/Economy/GST-currency-change-to-be-game-changers-for-economy-Jaitley/article16736585.ece © The Hindu Following the withdrawal of high-value currency notes, activity at PoS terminals saw exponential growth, even as the number of new such machines installed has also gone up."

Thirunavukkarasar has urged the Centre to extend the deadline for exchaning demonetised currency notes. Speaking to reporters here on Tuesday on the sidelines of a meeting with party cadre from western Tamil Nadu, he said that the Central Government should also take steps to increase in circulation the number of Rs. 50, Rs. 100 and Rs. 500 notes. Former Finance Minister P. Chidambaram had estimated that it would take the Government seven months to tide over the currency shortage crisis as 17 lakh notes had gone off circulation. Whereas, the Prime Minister had appealed to the people to give 50 days time to the Government. This went on to show that the Government was ill prepared to tackle the effects of demonetisation. Mr. Thirunavukkarasar blamed the Government for not constituting the Cauvery Management Board. The Government’s failure thus far to do so was keeping in mind the ensuing elections in Karnataka. The result of the failure was that Cauvery water had not reached the Delta districts, where farmers were committing suicide.

917,2016-12-01,24.0,?Demonetisation wounds will take time to heal?,"It will take three more months for the State to recover from the wounds caused by demonetisation. “There is acute shortage of Rs. 100 notes, Rs. 500 notes are not available, and Rs. 2,000 notes cannot be exchanged. It will take minimum three months for the dust to settle down,” D. Thomas Franco Rajendra Dev, senior vice-president of All India Bank Officers Confederation, told The Hindu. From day one, new generation private banks were given more currency by the Reserve Bank of India. Even the State Bank of India (SBI), which maintains the largest currency chest, has been asked to collect cash from ICICI Bank in Chennai and HDFC Bank in Coimbatore. According to Mr. Franco, three private banks were given Rs. 6,100 crore while the remaining banks were given Rs. 7,800 crore. As of March 2016, Tamil Nadu has 9,971 bank branches including foreign banks and regional rural banks. An official from a public sector bank said that December 1, the salary day is when the real heat would be felt. “There is a cash crunch and a fully loaded ATM runs out of cash in two hours. Customers are going to storm branches as soon as their salary lands in their accounts,” he said. Around 60 per cent of the ATMs in the State had started functioning but there was shortage of cash. On Wednesday, employees working in private firms got their salary credited into their accounts but were not able to withdraw it due to cash shortage. Many pensioners returned home empty handed. N.B.S. Mani, a retired BSNL employee who went to withdraw his pension money, had to return with an empty wallet. Mr Franco said that December 1 was going to be a challenging day for bankers. “Other than works related to demonetisation, regular banking activities have come to a halt. Advances are going down. Non Performing Assets are increasing. Deferment of repayment has been impacted. These trends are unhealthy,” he added.

918,2016-12-01,24.0,Noted American experts divided over India?s demonetisation drive,"Two prominent American economists have widely different views on India’s demonetisation drive. Harvard economist Kenneth Rogoff is of the opinion that the move will help tackle corruption and tax evasion, while Pranab Bardhan, Professor of Economics at the University of California, Berkeley, believes it cannot make “much of a dent in the long-term problem of corruption or black money.” Both of them shared their views with The Hindu through emails on Monday.   “There is little precedent in peacetime for India’s overnight demonetisation of its two largest banknotes.  The basic idea of taking old notes out of circulation and introducing new ones is perfectly normal and sensible, but usually this is done gradually over a period of years (per the plan I propose for advanced economies in my recent book The Curse of Cash). India’s approach of forcing a rapid exchange may well succeed in penalising corrupt politicians, criminal and tax evaders far more than a gradual approach would.  But even if the move had been well prepared, the collateral damage on ordinary people would still have been significant.  The long-run effects of India’s currency exchange on corruption, crime and tax evasion may yet prove so great they will still outweigh the short-run costs but that will depend on implementation,” said Mr. Rogoff. The Curse of Cash argues for eliminating large notes and not replacing them, which Mr. Rogoff said in a recent blog, “is not aimed at developing countries, where the share of people without effective access to banking is just too large.” But he has been largely supportive of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s move:  “Indeed, developing countries share some of the same problems and the corruption and counterfeiting problem is often worse. Simply replacing old notes with new ones does have a lot of beneficial effects similar to eliminating large notes. Anyone turning in large amounts of cash still becomes very vulnerable to legal and tax authorities. Indeed that is Modi’s idea. And criminals have to worry that if the government has done this once, it can do it again, making large notes less desirable and less liquid.” Mr. Bardhan does not agree with this view. “Most business people do not keep their black income under a mattress. They keep it in the form of gold, real estate, commodity stocks, and offshore accounts. Of course, they keep some amount in cash for various current transaction needs, but I doubt it's more than a very tiny percentage of total black money,” he said. “Apart from the tremendous hardship that the poor people are going through, the large informal sector in the economy will find it very difficult and time-consuming to recover from this big blow. Those who think the shrinkage of the informal sector is a good thing, do not realise that this will not suddenly push the informal sector to start using credit card or mobile wallets, or that there are not many formal sector jobs waiting for those who lose their livelihood in the informal sector. The bungling and mismanagement in the implementation of this highly intrusive and disruptive policy so far suggests ""maximum government, minimum governance"" exactly the opposite of what the Prime Minister had promised in 2014. He and his loyal Finance Minister keep on advising poor people to go digital (""eat cake"").” Mr. Bardhan said, real estate prices will take a hit temporarily, but “when the new notes come, real estate markets will go back to normal, unless some other drastic measures are taken.” “Politicians who had taken out cash to fund the forthcoming elections, say in UP, will get hit. BJP, of course, has the advantage of incumbency over other parties to get funds from its crony capitalists. In any case, things again will go back to normal, after the new notes are in circulation. The first step to curb undocumented election finance is to have regular mandatory and independent auditing of party funds, which no political party (including BJP) has accepted.” “…this is an awful way of doing it,” Mr. Bardhan said on the objective of curbing counterfeit notes. “Other countries (for example, the US facing the largest amount of counterfeit dollars in the world) do it in stages and quietly.” “Some economists hope that the government will have a windfall revenue gain from the unreturned cash, but this is likely to be cancelled by the diminished revenue prospects from a much slower-growing economy as a result of this policy. In the end this may turn out to be another of Modi's stunts to distract the electorate from his disappointing performance,” said Mr. Bardhan.

921,2016-12-02,25.0,Demonetisation effect: Marriages on the rocks,"The scarcity of cash in banks and the limit of Rs. 2.5 lakh withdrawal for marriages has become a cause for concern for parents. After the announcement of demonetisation of high value currency notes and the Reserve Bank of India giving a go-ahead for higher limit of withdrawal for marriages, the parents, whose children are due to tie the knot, rushed to banks to withdraw the same. However, they were in for a rude shock. Bankers have bluntly refused to give them the required cash stating that they have not received the necessary orders from the RBI. Banks are harassing account holders to give proof of wedding, copies of receipts of advances made to function halls and caterers, etc. They were also asked to provide details of persons to whom the amount is to be paid, together with a declaration from such persons that they do not have any bank account. A municipal employee, who was to get his daughter married on December 8, is worried with the attitude of bankers who have been denying him cash of up to Rs. 2.5 lakh on the pretext that he was not following RBI guidelines. “It is horrible that the banks are refusing to give me my hard-earned money for my daughter’s wedding. I am unable to pay my debts as well,” he said. M. Prathap Reddy, a headmaster of a government school, said his daughter was scheduled to get married on December 22 and he has not been able to buy anything due to the cash crunch. “I am struggling to get evidences of advance payments made to various persons. If I spend the entire time at banks trying to get the required cash, when will I distribute the wedding cards and make other purchases?” he lamented. On the other hand, bankers say that they have several restrictions on the cash withdrawal. “We are providing only Rs. 10,000 to the account holders, including employees, against the limit of Rs. 24,000 per week as there is no cash in the banks,” a banker said.

922,2016-12-02,25.0,Government?s demonetisation move faces legal challenge,"The CHRI note points to the contention that the demonetisation drive was launched by the present government without the sanction of a law passed by Parliament unlike in 1978.  
| Photo Credit: 
J. Manoharan The November 8 circular issued by the Finance Ministry announcing the Government of India’s decision to pull out high value currency notes of Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,000 from circulation, with immediate effect, is being challenged for its legal validity. Petitions challenging the move were in line to be heard before the Supreme Court on Friday, and are pending before various High Courts. Drawing comparisons between the current government’s efforts and those taken by the Janata Government in 1978, a note issued by the Commonwealth Human Rights Initiative (CHRI) on Friday pointed out that the present government’s efforts were at variance with the demonetisation drive carried out by the Janata government, given that in 1978 a law had been promulgated for the exercise. The High Denomination Bank Notes (Demonetisation) Act, 1978 (HDBND Act) was introduced by the Janata government to govern the practice of demonetisation, and was later upheld for its constitutional validity by the Supreme Court in the Jayantilal Ratanchand Shah & Ors., vs. Reserve Bank of India case in 1996. No Parliamentary sanction Firstly, the CHRI note points to the contention that the demonetisation drive was launched by the present government without the sanction of a law passed by Parliament unlike in 1978. It referred to the arguments made by lawyer Indira Jaisingh in this regard. Elaborating on the matter, the noted human rights lawyer and former Additional Solicitor General of India, Indira Jaisingh told The Hindu: “The November 8 notification was based on Section 26 sub-section (2) of the Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934. This section only allows you to withdraw a given series of notes from circulation. As per this legal section, the series of numbers of currency notes meant for withdrawal ought to be mentioned in the government notification. This section is not meant for demonetisation of every single currency note of that particular denomination as has been done now.” She further added that the purpose of the said legal clause in RBI Act was not to replace every single note in circulation. “This is one problem. The other is that this section does not put a limit to withdrawal of money as the current government notification does. Any limits imposed on the withdrawal of tax paid money by citizens amounts to a temporary modification of their rights. Since money is property in your hands, the government will need a law to be able to do that.” Also, responding to a query on whether the present government could override via executive fiat the existing law of the land, Ms. Jaisingh said that it depended on whether that law in question allows you to override it and contains a provision to enable the government do so, which is not the case right now. Variations from 1978 law Unlike the 1978 law, the present government notification does not prohibit the transfer of demonetised notes to persons other than banks. In the 1978 Act, Section 4 prohibited the transfer of the demonetised notes to anybody other than Scheduled Banks after the said currency notes had stopped being legal tender. Venkatesh Nayak, Programme Coordinator, CHRI’s Access to Information Programme, said that the absence of such provisions may have already allowed black money holders to transfer unaccounted for funds to third parties, thus subverting the very purpose of the current exercise. The CHRI note also refers to the absence of a clause for declaring the source of the demonetised notes as was included in the earlier law. In the 1978 Act, Section 7 required every individual, company, trust or society intending to redeem the value of the demonetised notes to submit a declaration, in triplicate, with details of reasons for keeping the amount sought to be exchanged in high value denominations; source from which the demonetised notes were acquired; whether the person seeking to exchange the demonetised notes had borrowed them from any person, and if so, details were to be provided; and if the person making the declaration was not the owner of the demonetised notes, then the name of the true owner with a declaration that the notes were not held benami. The 1978 law also stipulated punishments for making false declarations at the time of depositing demonetised notes in the bank, but no such provisions were contained in the November 8 notification. However, no such transparency and accountability measure was envisaged in the November 8 notification, CHRI observed, questioning the efficacy of the present exercise.

923,2016-12-02,25.0,"Explain steps taken to ease suffering of rural people after demonetisation, SC tells Centre","In this November 15, 2016 photo, people queue up outside a bank in Bhutkirhut village on the outskirts of Siliguri.
  The Supreme Court on Friday asked the Union government to spell out the steps taken to ease the suffering and inconvenience of people in rural areas, who are mostly dependent on cooperative banks, post demonetisation. A bench of Chief Justice T.S. Thakur and Justice D.Y. Chandrachud, while hearing a batch of pleas challenging various aspects of demonetisation, said all the parties should sit together and prepare a list of categories of cases that could be referred to High Courts and those that could be heard by the apex court. Attorney General Mukul Rohatgi said the government was aware of the situation in cooperative banks, which lacked proper infrastructure and mechanism, compared to scheduled banks. “Entire chapter in the additional affidavit filed by the Centre is dedicated to the issue of cooperative banks. It is not that we are not aware of the situation but these [the cooperative banks] lack proper facilities, mechanism and proper infrastructure as compared to scheduled banks,” he said. The government deliberately kept cooperative banks out of the drive as these did not have the expertise to detect fake currency. Mr. Rohatgi said, “Several cases are filed each passing day in various high courts on various aspects post demonetisation and it is not possible to deal with cases simultaneously in Kerala, Kolkata, Jaipur and Mumbai... All these matter should be clubbed together and be referred to any one high court or the apex court should hear them.” Senior advocate P. Chidambaram, appearing for cooperative banks, questioned the government’s decision, saying the rural economy is almost paralysed due to non-inclusion of cooperative banks. Senior advocate Kapil Sibal, appearing for one of the petitioners, suggested that they will sit together and file the list of categories by Monday. The bench then posted the hearing on the matter to December 5.

924,2016-12-02,25.0,Demonetisation: Where it stands now,"Weeks after the government demonetised high value currency and introduced Rs. 2000 notes, the Reserve Bank of India and the Finance Ministry made a series of announcements, and even modified its earlier ones depending on people’s reaction. Read all of them at a glance below: No more exchange Scrapped Rs. 1000 and Rs. 500 notes will no longer be exchanged at banks. From November 25, they can be exchanged only at RBI. However, these notes can be deposited at banks. Earlier, banks were applying indelible ink mark on the right index finger of customers in select metro cities, to stop repeat money exchange with invalid currency notes. No more old notes Though old Rs. 500 notes were accepted in places such as petrol pumps, government hospitals, airports, and for paying government-related utility dues, Finance Ministry will be stopping this arrangement from Friday midnight. Toll collection resumes Commuters will now have to pay at toll plazas to ply in National Highways. Toll plazas will accept scrapped Rs.500 currency notes, provided the toll fee is higher than Rs. 200. “The old Rs. 500 notes will be accepted till the midnight of December 15, but this will only be for purchasing FASTags and for making toll payments of more than Rs 200,” the Road Transport and Highways Ministry said in a statement. Cap on Jan Dhan withdrawals The RBI, in a notification issued on November 29, 2016, said Jan Dhan account holders can withdraw only up to Rs. 10,000 a month. The move was to protect rural account holders from activities of money laundering and legal consequences under the Benami Property Transaction & Money Laundering laws, it said. Push to go cashless Prime Minister Narendra Modi urged for a movement to turn India into a cashless society. He asked young people to teach mobile banking and other e-commerce technology to at least 10 families. The government scrapped excise duty on point of service (POS) machines, waived off transaction charges on card payments till year-end, and also announced incentives such as cancellation of service charges in certain category to help promote electronic payments using debit card, Internet and mobile phones. The government is widely publicising Unified Payment Interface (UPI), mobile wallets and prepaid cards. Disclose bank transactions Mr. Modi on November 29, 2016, asked BJP MPs, Ministers and MLAs to declare their bank transactions from November 8 (the day Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,000 notes were demonetised) to December 31 to party president Amit Shah by January 1, 2017. With this step, the BJP wants to add more credibility to its anti-black money drive. Amendments to IT Act The Centre on November 28, introduced a Bill in the Lok Sabha — a proposal to impose 50 per cent tax on undeclared income that is voluntarily disclosed till December 30, following which 82.5 per cent (75 per cent tax and 10 per cent of such tax as penalty) could be levied on undeclared income detected by authorities. The tax changes are intended to supplement the demonetisation move targeted at curbing black money, the Finance Ministry said in a statement. Withdrawal limits eased The RBI on November 28, 2016 said that if deposits had been made in legal tender, then depositors could withdraw that amount over and above the Rs. 24,000 weekly limit. The move was aimed at allowing comfort to individuals who were hesitant to deposit legal tender following the withdrawal of high-value currency notes which came into effect from November 9. Opposition protests A nationwide shutdown was called by Left parties against the demonetisation of high value currency. It evoked partial response. The Congress decided not to participate in the bandh. While the Left parties, including the CPI(M) and the CPI, called a 12-hour bandh to protest against the move in West Bengal, Mamata Banerjee’s Trinamool Congress did not join it but held protests. Leniency to farmers To ensure sowing in the Rabi season, the government has allowed farmers to withdraw Rs. 25,000 a week against crop loan/kisan credit card. Traders in agricultural mandis will be permitted to draw Rs. 50,000 in cash per week to pay for sundry expenses like wages. While the time limit for payment of crop loan insurance premium has been extended by 15 days, government employees up to Group C have been given an option to draw salary advance in cash.

925,2016-12-02,25.0,Demonetisation biggest scam in Indian history: Kejriwal,"Demonetisation was the “biggest scam of Indian history” which aimed to collect the hard-earned money of common people and use it to bail out industrialists through banks, alleged Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal at a rally in Meerut on Thursday. This was the first of the series of rallies the Aam Aadmi Party has planned across the country against demonetisation. “Who has praised demonetisation? Did common people praise the move? No, it was industrialists like Adani, Ambani and Vijay Mallya who praised it. The common masses, the farmer, the small trader, labourer, are all standing in queues all day,” said Mr. Kejriwal. “Had demonetisation intended to bring back black money, then farmers, poor people and labourers would not have suffered heart attack while standing in queues, but people like Vijay Mallya should have been acted against,” asserted the Delhi Chief Minister. “Since the time Modiji became Prime Minister, he has written off loans to the tune of Rs. 1.14 lakh crore which were taken by his industrialist friends. I want to know how much money was exchanged between the Modi government and these industrialists,” he said. “After the loan of Rs. 1.14 lakh crore was written off, banks were empty and about to be bankrupt then Modiji and BJP leaders like Amit Shah came up with this plan. This is not my allegation; reports of the Reserve Bank of India and the CAG say that industrialists did not pay back loan to the tune of Rs. 8 lakh crore. Now where will that money come. Your hard money will be used to compensate for it. Had the Modi government been serious about black money, all it had to do was to act on the list of 648 black money holders,” Mr. Kejriwal said.

926,2016-12-02,25.0,"Currency ban is ?good medicine? for economy, says Minister","Minister of State for Labour and Employment Bandaru Dattatreya on Tuesday said the demonetisation drive was a “big surgical operation” and a “good medicine” that would yield positive results by eliminating black money from the economy. The Minister was speaking at a special event on ‘Technology and the Future of Work’, organised by the Union Labour Ministry in partnership with the International Labour Organisation (ILO). “People worry that technology may take away jobs. But there is no need to worry about the future of jobs. Those who work hard and learn new skills won't have a problem accessing decent jobs,” Mr Dattatreya said. Aadhaar-EPFO links Speaking of technology helping labour, he pointed out that the linking of Aadhar cards to the Employee’s Provident Fund Organisation (EPFO) had enabled the swift settlement of claims. “Now information about pension and PF are readily available on a mobile phone. Currently 17.80 crore EPFO accounts are operated daily, and thanks to the government’s initiative, the settlement of claims is nearly 100 per cent,” the Minister said. Mr Dattatreya went on to say that, “It is the mind which determines the solutions offered by technology. If the mind is good, good solutions will be produced. If the mind is bad, bad solutions will be produced.” The Minister added that, “One hour of yoga every day will help you keep a good mind.” Inclusive employment Ms. Panudda Boonpala, Director, ILO Decent Work Team for South Asia, said technology would no doubt improve productivity, but it was necessary to debate its impact on the quality of employment and the protection of workers’ rights. “As technology changes the nature of work, we have to ensure that employment remains inclusive, and vulnerable sections such as women and unskilled workers are not left behind or exploited,” she said. Ms. M Sathiyavathy, secretary in the Labour Ministry, said that the ministry has sent circulars to all State governments urging them to open bank accounts for every member of the working population. “About 25.68 crore accounts have been opened under the Jan Dhan Yojana. If we assume five persons per household, nearly the entire Indian population has been covered. With near total financial inclusion and high mobile phone penetration, every Indian is now part of the ICT (Information-Communications-Technology) network. With re-skilling and up-skilling of the workforce, India is well placed to reap its demographic dividend,” she said. Technology as disruption In his keynote address, historian Prabhu Mohapatra drew attention to the importance of learning from history on the disruptive impact of technology on social relations. “For instance, in the 18th century, the ginning technology that made mass farming of cotton profitable, also gave a fresh lease of life to slavery. It was definitely a technology that generated employment and spectacularly improved productivity, but the work relations it entrenched were of slavery. When we discuss technology and work, we therefore need to go beyond the narrow framework of efficiency, cost and productivity-centred debates, and look at how technology is changing social relations, especially work relations,” he said. Improve education Mr Dev Nathan, professor of economics at the Institute for Human Development, pointed out that digitisation will enable the formalisation of the informal economy. “But to truly be able to leverage technology, India needs to raise the bar on schooling, and ensure the universal delivery of at least higher secondary-level education,” he said. “Technology should assist, not displace human workers,” said trade union leader Saji Narayanan of the Bharatiya Mazdoor Sangh (BMS). “Especially in a country like India with a massive working population, when we speak of technological innovation in relation to work, we need labour-intensive, and not labour-displacing technology. A sustainable enterprise is not possible without labour welfare, and trade unions need assistance in assessing the impact of new technology on labour welfare,” he said.

de02 shoe It is 2 p.m. A small workshop located in the extreme corner of Chakki Paat, a densely populated Dalit settlement which produces tens of thousands of shoes every day, is quiet. Of the 20-odd workers, only three karigars are showing the magic of their hands. On a normal day, they don’t get time to strike a conversation with each other, given that they have to produce 200 pairs of shoes at the end of the day. Ever since the demonetisation announcement, the workers at the unit have had no work, just like over three lakh workers associated with the city’s unorganised shoe manufacturing industry. Lives paralysed “Our lives have been pushed back by at least 10 years. The government has prevented us from withdrawing our own hard-earned money and thereby paralysed the shoe manufacturing units,” says Bharat Singh, the owner of the workshop. In Agra, families join hands with workers, mainly Dalits and Muslims, and set up small manufacturing units which work only on cash. There are 10,000 such workshops, located in Qazi Pada and Teela Nanadram, which produce over 10,00,000 pairs of shoes daily. The annual turnover is said to be Rs. 14,000 crore. Agra itself contributes to 28 per cent of the national export and 65 per cent of the domestic consumption of shoes in the country. For the past three weeks, Mr. Singh, a Dalit whose grandfather Bihari Singh had initially adopted an upper-caste title as a ‘protest against caste oppression’ and later converted to Buddhism when B.R. Ambedkar visited Agra in March 1956, has had to run not only his own house but also take care of his workers hit by demonetisation. No demand “We neither have cash to buy raw material, nor is there any demand for our products. After standing outside banks for half a day, we get just Rs. 5,000 instead of Rs. 50,000 a week,” adds Mr. Singh,. Mr. Singh says the Modi government is harming poor and lower-middle class people. “The shoes we make are meant for poor and lower middle class people. If we are unable to make shoes during winters, the season when the poor need shoes the most, whom is the Modi government harming,” asks Mr. Singh, who is also associated with the unorganised sector shoe workers’ association in Agra. Hari, a shoe-worker who went out of work after demonetisation, agrees with Mr. Singh. He worked at a workshop in Qazi Pada, but on Wednesday, he had no work. “I was busy completing old orders. After demonetisation, there has been no work for me. I am thinking of pulling a rickshaw outside the railway station,” he says. Impending crisis? Upendra Singh of the Agra Shoe Manufacturing Association, which takes care of the interests of domestic and unorganised shoe manufacturing units, echoes the same views: “There is no one in Agra who is not dependent on the shoe manufacturing industry for their survival. If they go out of work for a longer period of time, a huge crisis will ensue,” he says. Puran Dawar, chairman of the Chambers for Agra Footwear Manufacturers and Exporters, terms the digitisation of financial transactions a “good move”. “The crisis is temporary. The government wants completely cashless mode of payments, and we want to do that because it will ensure minimum wages to workers as well as provident funds to them. But the government should give us some time so that we can get all the workers to have bank accounts,” he adds.

Purandeswari and MLC Somu Veerraju have said. The problems being faced by the people at banks were only temporary, they said here on Thursday, and accused the opposition parties of blowing things out of proportion. Both the leaders were here to attend the party’s training programme. Speaking on the occasion, Ms. Purandeswari said that the people wholeheartedly welcomed Prime Minister’s Narendra Modi’s demonetisation decision. “The decision to ban high-value currency notes has only bolstered the party’s image in the country. It, however, has shocked people who amassed black money,” she said. Mr. Veerraju and party district in-charge P.V.N. Madhav said that only BJP had trained cadre at all levels. They hoped that the party would emerge as a force to reckon with in Andhra Pradesh, particularly in the north Andhra region. BJP State secretary P. Venugopalam, Kisan Morcha president P. Tirupati Rao, former MP Kaniti Viswanatham, and district president Kotagiri Narayana Rao were among other leaders who spoke at the training programme.

929,2016-12-02,25.0,Traditional arts take a beating owing to demonetisation,"Threatened: A 17th Century Bidriware with gold engravings used as Hukka base; wooden-and-lacquerware toys and dolls at a stall in Channapatna of Ramanagaram district.
  Traditional crafts, already struggling to survive amidst machine-made goods flooding the markets, appear to be taking a further beating with demonetisation. Tales of artisans of three signature craft forms of Karnataka – Bidriware of Bidar, Kinnala toys of Koppal, and Channapatna toys of Ramanagaram – are testimony to this. “We saw people line up before gold shops after demonetisation, but we did not expect silver rates to go up as well,” rued Abdul Bari, a third generation Bidri artisan. B-grade silver (lower in quality compared to what is used in jewellery), essential to the traditional metal handicraft of the region, has gone up from Rs. 475 per 10 grams to Rs. 600 now. This, coupled with poor sales, has hit people like Mr. Bari hard. Bidriware is made using copper, zinc and silver. Each artisan needs silver between one kg to three kgs a month. Most of Bidri artisans’ transactions are cash based, says Rashid Ahmed Quadri, national award-winning artisan. “In my 40 years, I have never seen such a sudden drop in sales,” he said. A lot of Bidriware is sold online, but the participation of local artisans in that trade is negligible, said S. Shafi Ahmed, founder of Black Gold, a federation of Bidri artisans. Assistant artisan Ashok Ram, who earlier got paid every month, has not got paid for last two weeks. “The craftsmen are putting off payments citing that sales are less,” he said. The toy story The non-toxic wooden-and-lacquerware toys of Channapatna, which had recently gained a foothold in international market, are now feeling a push back too. The traditional toy makers say that counter sales have come down by nearly 90 per cent, while exports are not as badly hit. Shops that dot the Bengaluru-Mysuru highway selling Channapatna toys, between Mandya and Bidadi, are full of unsold wares. The fact that little toys cost between Rs. 10 and Rs. 80 makes them particularly susceptible to shortage of lower denomination notes. Kinnala too The Kinnal toy-makers in Koppal district, most of whom are Dalits, find themselves in a similar condition. Ajay Chitragar, an artisan, says that the toy-makers sell and collect money from traders, middlemen or societies. “Traders are either asking us to wait for one month or are offering less than the market price,” he said. Worse, one person in the family is exclusively spending the entire man-day queueing up before the bank. “We had to go to the lone bank branch in Kinnal village and stand before the bank between 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. Even then, there was no guarantee of getting the money,” he said. “Though the government says you can withdraw Rs. 25,000 a week, the banks say they don’t have much cash and need to ration it out to all. This is adding to our problems,” he said.

930,2016-12-03,26.0,Impact of demonetisation on party politics in Karnataka,"The demonetisation of high-value currency has no doubt had an impact on all sections of the population, leave alone trade and business, and in Karnataka, this is expected to impact party politics as well. It is common knowledge that the Bharatiya Janata Party enjoys considerable clout in Bengaluru in particular and the State in general, thanks to the patronage of trade and industry, particularly the informal sector. Added to this is the large number of businessmen hailing from several northern and western States forming part of flourishing businesses here, who have extended considerable support to the BJP over the years. The demonetisation drive has largely affected this section of people, and it’s obvious that they believe the root cause of all their monetary problems, with the need to account for all their transactions, is thanks to the policy decisions of the BJP government at the Centre. A cross section of the people in this sector, who largely have their business offices in the core areas of Bengaluru, told The Hindu that their businesses have been hard hit and it may take a long time to recover. The salaried class and in particular the employees of the Information Technology sector, who constitute nearly a fifth of the population of Bengaluru are evidently happy with demonetisation since they believe that the measures being adopted by the Union government will work against the increasing corruption at all levels of the bureaucracy and in politics. Political corruption and bribery demands of the bureaucracy have resulted in a multitude of problems and there is no check at the present juncture, with the Karnataka Lokayukta remaining without a chief and the newly constituted Anti-Corruption Bureau merely remaining a wing of the State government. Demonetisation has come about at a time when the popularity of the State Congress and in particular that of the Siddaramaiah government is sinking in contrast to the growing influence of the BJP. It is another matter that there is serious intra party differences within the BJP, and efforts are still on to bring about a rapprochement among some of the senior BJP leaders such as K.S. Eshwarappa (Leader of the Opposition in the Legislative Council), who have raised their voice of dissent against the party president and former Chief Minister B.S. Yeddyurappa. It has also been announced that should the BJP wrest power from the Congress, then Mr. Yeddyurappa will be the obvious choice for the post of Chief Minister. This apart, there are unconfirmed reports that some of the State BJP leaders were privy to information on demonetisation well ahead of the Prime Minister’s announcement on November 8, resulting in some of them indulging in business takeovers and other activities to provide a makeover to their illegal wealth. The common people, who are witness to all this accumulation of wealth, believe that demonetisation and other follow-up operations should serve to put an end to such illegalities. What is now to be seen is the strategy that the State unit of the BJP will adopt to ensure that it does not suffer any hit to its popularity. That the one-day bandh called by the Opposition parties on November 28 did not work to the advantage of the ruling Congress did provide some relief to the BJP in Karnataka.

| Photo Credit: S_S_KUMAR People seeking to withdraw cash continued to reel under the effect of demonetisation with several banks in Puducherry not being replenished with currency notes by the Reserve Bank of India on Saturday. Many ATMs remained non-functional. The Muthialpet branch of Canara Bank has put up a notice stating that it has not received currency notes from the RBI. A senior bank official said that they were receiving Rs. 30 lakh as against Rs. 2 crore required every day. “We have been rationing the money by giving Rs. 4,000 for SB account holders and Rs. 10,000 a day for the current account holders. However, customers demanded that they be paid higher amount on the beginning of the month. In the last two days, we allowed the SB account holders to withdraw Rs. 8,000 and Rs 40,000 for current account holders. So far, we have received only notes of denomination of 2,000. The bank does not have notes of 500 or 100 denomination,” said the official. The official added that they received cash till Friday. “On Friday evening, we received a call that cash would not be supplied on Saturday. The RBI is not working on Saturday. We need to wait till Monday to get cash,” the official added. Canara Bank has 49 branches in Puducherry. The UCO bank had only Rs. 2,000 notes. Confederation of Puducherry State Government Employees’ Association General Secretary Premadasan said the association had demanded the government to pay at least Rs. 10,000 in cash as part of the salary. “The government did not consider our demand since there is no cash with the banks. The middle class and the lower middle class have been affected the most. Even a small tea stall owner is facing a loss of 30 to 40 per cent in the income,” he said. Association president Balamohan added that even pensioners were facing the same problems. “There is no relief for the senior citizens either,” he added.

932,2016-12-03,26.0,"Post demonetisation, Hyundai opts for coastal route to move cars","The logistics service sector has been badly impacted for the last three weeks due to the Centre’s demonetisation move. Besides, the non-availability of Rs.100 notes has made it difficult for logistic service providers to aggregate large number of vehicles as truck drivers need money to meet fuel, toll and other expenses. Usually, large number of trucks are hired to move goods from Tamil Nadu to other parts of the country. Having gained rich experience of moving cars from one port to another, Hyundai Motor India Ltd., (HMIL) has started tilting towards the coastal route. Out of the total volume, 96 per cent of cars are sent through road and rest by rail. On Monday, HMIL will be moving 2,500 cars through Roll-on Roll-off vessel to Kandla from Kamarajar Port at Ennore. From there, trucks would be deployed to dispatch cars to Mumbai, Gujarat, National Capital Region and Rajasthan. Last month, HMIL shipped 1,450 cars through coastal route. “Due to the Centre’s demonetisation move, sufficient number of specialised trucks are not available to lift cars. This will badly affect the delivery schedule and also our production volume in the coming days. As of now, we have not cut our production volume,” said V. Anand, HMIL Senior General Manager, Outbound Logistics. Mr. Anand said a delay in delivery schedule would place the dealers in a tight spot, as they would have borrowed money to book the cars. They have to pay interest from day one. HMIL was trying to compensate them. Besides, the dealers had to handle customers. “Initially, our service provider faced some last mile issue. Now that has been sorted out. We are now depending on coastal movement,” he said. For 2016, HMIL planned to produce five lakh cars for domestic markets and 1.6 lakh cars for export.

935,2016-12-03,26.0,Living with demonetisation,"The political opposition to demonetisation — evident in what one sees in Parliament, and outside it — leaves much to be desired (“Modi’s presence in Rajya Sabha fails to break the ice”, Dec.2). Our Members of Parliament seem to forget that they are there to highlight the problems faced in their constituencies and find redress for them. Instead, they raise issues that have no relevance to any parliamentary discussion, an example being the delay in the landing of a flight on which the Chief Minister of West Bengal was a passenger (“Turbulence over Mamata flight delay”, Dec.2). How can there be any objection to the steps being taken by the government to wipe out the black economy? In view of the enormity of the problem, there will be some temporary inconvenience to the common man. S. Chidambaresa Iyer, Chennai If the circulation of counterfeit notes is said to be rampant, it speaks poorly of the vigilance agencies. If the new notes reach antisocial and terrorist groups, say after a year or two, will the government roll out demonetisation once again? When much of India is outside the Internet age, why talk of the cashless mode now? R. Ranganathan, Ahmedabad I have been following Indian politics for about a decade and can say that this is the first time I have seen a Prime Minister who has had the courage to take hard but imperative decisions. Obviously he knew that the execution of demonetisation could end up badly and dent his image, but he wanted to keep this exercise a secret, to maximise its efficiency. I have not suffered its effects, so it is wrong for me to make comments. I am supremely confident that the country is radically improving for the first time in so many years and hope that the momentum is not lost. Mihir Bhagat, Evanston, Illinois, U.S. Demonetisation is being heralded as a direct fight against black money; in fact even the U.S. said that it is a necessary step (Dec.2). But the Central government must keep in mind the adage “history repeats itself” if the recovery of nearly Rs.4 crore in new currency notes from government officials and Rs.2,000 notes from insurgents is an indication. Such elements will go to any extent to recover what they have lost due to demonetisation. To tackle this, the government should strengthen institutions such as the anti-corruption bureau while IT officials should institute a strong grievance redressal mechanism, appointing Lokayuktas in all States. There should also be greater awareness of RTI.

Comparing the policy to a medical operation, Mr. Pawar said, “Despite the doctor having performed a successful operation, there was a chance that the patient’s health could deteriorate rapidly as proper care wasn’t being taken.” Speaking at a party meeting here, Mr. Pawar expressed scepticism over the notion of a ‘cashless economy’ in agriculture-focused regions of India. The Maratha strongman also claimed that 92 per cent of the country’s transactions are cash-based. He also disapproved of Reserve Bank of India’s (RBI) November 14 order that prohibited cooperative banks from accepting or exchanging the discarded Rs. 500 or Rs. 1000 currency notes, and said that the district central cooperative banks (DCCB) of Maharashtra were sitting on a cash pile of nearly Rs. 5000 crore. “The RBI ban has disrupted the economic life in rural areas with no provision of what exactly is to be done with the large amount collected in old notes by the DCCBs,” Mr. Pawar said. Commenting on his often remarked closeness to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Mr. Pawar said he considers issues of national importance over indulging in politics. “It is often remarked that I am very close to Mr. Modi. But when it comes to issues of national importance, I’ve never indulged in politics or considered whether the Prime Minister is from the Opposition. Party politics must be transcended to resolve pressing issues like agrarian matters or other similar issues,” he said.

The local level campaign will focus on the disruption in ration supply owing to the Centre’s action in the name of implementing the Food Safety Act. The State had requested the Centre to provide time to Kerala for implementing the Act.

V. Sudershan  Congress today demanded a white paper from the Centre on the demonetisation move which it claimed is the “biggest scam of India” and sought a probe into it by a Joint Parliamentary Committee. “We want to know with whom did the Central government hold discussion about demonetisation. The government should issue a white paper on this,” senior party leader Digvijay Singh told reporters here. “A Joint Parliamentary Committee (JPC) should probe the entire issue of demonetisation which helped BJP and its men convert black money into assets,” he said. Mr. Singh alleged that even the Prime Minister’s Chief Economic Adviser Arvind Subramanian and other officials were in the dark about the impending demonetisation. “Some people had information in advance which is evident from the fact that Rs one crore were deposited in BJP’s account in a Kolkata bank in addition to the party buying land in Bihar and Odisha,” he claimed. Singh, a Rajya Sabha member, was in the state capital as part of the party’s strategy to get people acquainted with the Congress’ view on demonetisation. He was accompanied by Bihar Congress chief and Bihar Education Minister Ashok Choudhary, Sadanand Singh, Dilip Kumar Choudhary, H.K. Verma and others. Terming demonetisation as the “biggest scam of India”, Mr. Singh alleged that Punjab BJP’s legal cell co-convenor Sanjeev Kamboj had put his photograph on social media with wads of new notes of Rs. 2,000 that raises a question mark on the BJP leaders having free access to new currency notes when the common people are standing in lines to withdraw money. He pointed out that the Modi government increased the “limit of foreign remittances from India” from 75,000 to 2.5 lakh US Dollars, and alleged that the decision led to an outflow of nearly Rs. 30,000 crore from the country only in one year prior to demonetisation. “Whose money was sent out is yet to be disclosed,” Mr. Singh said.

Large chunk of the cash was being transported in a car while as many as eight persons were arrested and two firearms were seized from them. “On receipt of credible telephonic information regarding transportation of huge quantity of new currency, a team was formed to verify the veracity of information. During raid and verification of information, the police party stumbled upon huge cash and firearms inside it,” Akhileswar Singh, Superintendent of Police of Sambalpur told media persons. “Four accused were apprehended with cash and pistols. Preliminary questioning of these accused led to arrest of another four persons. Besides, some additional cash was seized from possession of latter four,” said Mr. Singh. The accused identified as Zyarat Ali, aged 59, hailed from Sunapali area of Sambalpur while his sons Mohammed Quazzfi (35), Riffat Ali (33) and Sabatin Ali (31) were also apprehended. Rasmiranjan Rout, a bank employee, and his brother Pankaj Rout were taken into custody in this connection. Zyarat Ali was identified as a liquor trader. As per Sambalpur police, total amount seized during search was Rs. 1,42,91,500. Of total amount, new currency notes were worth of Rs. 85,62,00 while banned notes including Rs. 1000 and Rs. 500 were estimated to be Rs. 25,29,000. Similarly, smaller currencies in Rs. 100, Rs. 50 and Rs. 10 denominations were counted to be Rs. 32 ,00,500. “Preliminary investigation showed attempts were made to convert huge unaccounted old banknotes into new notes. Arrest of a bank employee showed that conversion of old notes into new ones could not have been possible without involvement of bank employees,” said Sambalpur SP. Investigators found that insiders in banks were charging 25 to 30 per cent share for conversion of old money into new currency notes. “We are investigating into the case to ascertain the modus operandi,” said Mr. Singh.

Ranjeet Kumar Long before Viagra hit the market in 1998, the vaidyas (‘physicians’) of Katrisarai in Bihar’s Nalanda district were running highly successful businesses mailing products plugged as aphrodisiacs and cures for a variety of mainly sexual and skin ailments to seekers of cures who prefer anonymity. The average monthly revenue of the Katrisarai sub-post office prior to demonetisation was a startling Rs. 75-90 lakh, though post-demonetisation, from November 9 to 30, it was down to a mere Rs. 18.82 lakh. “This is actually a sub-post office and yet, it’s the top revenue generating post office in the State and is also among the top 10 [revenue generating post offices] in the country,” postmaster Nagendra Prasad told The Hindu. The nondescript village with a population of nearly 8,000 has been a hub for vaidyas — some allegedly fake, others said to be genuine — who offer shartiya elaaz (guaranteed treatment) with locally mixed powders. “It has been like cottage industry here since the British period. I am the fourth generation of my family doing this business,” 59-year-old Kishore Kumar told The Hindu. Mr. Kumar says there are 40-50 “genuine” vaidyas in the town. But the post office has a list of 179 vaidyas who regularly courier their formulations in insured parcels. Going places Inside the freshly whitewashed post office, which functions out of an old house, rows of large plastic bags containing small wooden boxes packed with locally mixed formulations are ready to be sent off to every corner of the country — Kerala, Maharashtra, Andhra Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Jharkhand, Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan and Haryana. “Parcels from here were earlier even sent to some African countries, Nepal, Bangladesh and Bhutan,” said a post office employee. “We undertake only insured value payable post parcels and charge Rs. 103 for each weighing up to 500 grams.” Most of Katrisarai’s self-styled vaidyas build their enterprises with advertisements published in vernacular newspapers of various States with their contact numbers. Ami Chand, an Ayurvedic practitioner, is said to have first succeeded in such an enterprise from here and, since then, his legacy has been taken forward by his family members and other villagers. Today, almost every household here has a vaidya. The prosperity that the business has brought to the village can be seen both in the way the houses are built and in the SUVs parked outside them. Demonetisation has changed all that. ‘Fraud and fake’ Pinki Prasad, station in charge of the Katrisarai police station, says “Most of them [the vaidyas] are fraud and fake. Several of them have also been arrested in the past five years.” This year, over two dozen people have been arrested, while in September 2012, altogether 70 people were arrested, she adds. On the police station premises, heaps of seized wooden boxes containing fake aphrodisiacs and drugs are piled in one corner. “We are [now] getting income details of the self-proclaimed vaidyas here from the post office and bank accounts to send them to the Income Tax Department. They earn in crores but pay almost nil tax,” investigating officer Rajesh Kumar told The Hindu. Demonetisation appears to have stopped these enterprises in their tracks. It [demonetisation] has rendered us paupers. Our couriered parcels are being returned every day and we are also not able to buy raw materials from the local market as we have no cash. The workers too have gone away as we are not able to pay them in the new currency notes,” echoes a group of vaidyas, including Uma Charan Chaurasia, Mukesh Kumar Gupta, Pappu Kumar Chaurasia, Jay Prakash Prasad and Kishore Kumar.

944,2016-12-04,27.0,Demonetisation: Cash woes leave handicraft sector in dire straits,"Handicraft sector in Mysuru is tottering for survival owing to the impact of demonetisation with artisans barely churning out a fraction of their normal output following a drop in demand. Almost one month into the demonetisation exercise and with no signs of abatement of currency crunch, there are fears that continued crisis could result in artisans quitting their profession. Though the crisis and downturn has affected every sector, work orders for handicraft artisans do not come on a daily basis as in the case of casual labourers. Hence, the dwindling number of orders for handicraft products affects them more. Besides, the number of tourists visiting Mysuru had reduced owing to the current crisis and hence their sales had taken a beating. S. Ramu, an artisan and member of the Handicraft Manufacturers Association, told The Hindu that handicraft sales had fallen by 50 per cent to 60 per cent and had affected both daily wagers and skilled artisans. “Despite slowdown in sales, the skilled artisans have to be paid to retain their services failing which they would quit,” he said. Even emporiums which promote handicraft products and help artisans and the art form thrive, have reported poor sales in the last one month, Mr. Ramu said. “However, some entrepreneurs with bank accounts are drawing from their reserves to pay workers but there is a limit of Rs. 24,000,” he added. The sector sustains nearly 6,000 artisans and daily wagers in Mysuru, which is known for wood inlay and engravings among others. There are nearly 200 units engaged in the manufacture of various craft products most of which are wood-based. The Mysuru wood inlay work is among the more popular items and has been accorded the Geographical Indication (GI) tag. This is the second blow to the handicraft sector in recent times after the exports and domestic sales took a beating during the economic downturn a few years ago. But with public money locked up in banks owing to paucity of new notes, domestic sales too had plummeted. The association believes the hiccup is temporary and realising the imperatives of going cashless, plans to encourage artisans to migrate to e-banking and plastic money.

Laxman assured that the decision to demonetise high value currency notes of Rs. 1,000 and Rs. 500 taken by Prime Minister Narendra Modi was “not sudden.” Addressing a symposium on ‘demonetisation: towards a corruption-free and cashless society’ organised by the Telangana Yuvajana Sanghaala Samakhya here on Monday, Mr. Laxman said a lot many preparations preceded the move, which were either ridiculed or ignored by the Opposition parties. Soon after coming to power riding on the promise to eradicate black money, Mr. Modi had constituted a special investigation team for exploring ways to bring out black money in the country. His frequent tours abroad were meant to enter into information exchange agreements with the respective governments so that laws in the country may be amended against holding black money, he said. A total of 25 crore bank accounts were opened by way of Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojna for financial inclusion, owing to which transparency was improved. Middlemen were eliminated with the direct benefit transfer to the poor. Though black money hoarders were given a chance to declare it through voluntary disclosure, many had not taken it seriously. Combination of Jan Dhan, Aadhaar, and mobile banking was the way to root out corruption, Mr. Laxman said. The demonetisation move had disabled the export of terrorism by Pakistan by stopping the circulation of fake currency notes. Normalcy had returned to Kashmir valley where students were busy writing examinations. He called upon the youth and the BJP cadres to support the Prime Minister’s initiative for corruption-free governance by spreading awareness about cashless transactions.

| Photo Credit: K_MURALI_KUMAR Bengaluru: The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) has uncovered the role of some bankers in Bengaluru who allegedly helped bureaucrats and contractors exchange crores of demonetised currency with new notes. Initial findings points to a massive effort to fraudulently divert new currency meant for the banks’ customers to private individuals. In an FIR registered by the CBI, investigators have identified the Indiranagar branch of Karnataka Bank and the J.C. Road branch of Dhanalaxmi Bank as the source of the biggest new currency haul during last week's I-T searches in the city. Sleuths had found Rs 5.7 crore in new Rs. 2,000 denomination notes from the premises of bureaucrats and contractors. CBI sleuths are questioning Suryanarayana Bairy, Chief Manager, Karnataka Bank, Indiranagar and Umashankar Renuka, branch manager, Dhanalaxmi Bank, J.C. Road along with officials of an ATM logistics firm Two types of frauds perpetuated The FIR narrates two kinds of fraud. One involved the diversion of new currency using falsified ID documents to misrepresent exchange at banks before November 24. In the second, money meant for ATM kiosks was diverted for illegal exchange with old currency. The FIR reveals that Suryanarayana Bairy unauthorisedly diverted new currency. He allegedly ‘falsified the accounts of his bank on the basis of forged and fabricated documents of identity and address proof in the names of several individuals to misrepresent that the new currency notes were exchanged with the general public at the bank counters.” The CBI has seized applications along with ID proofs submitted to the bank for exchange of old notes and vouchers through which money was withdrawn. Monies for ATM diverted At the J.C. Road branch of Dhanalaxmi Bank, the FIR alleges that Umashankar Renuka, manager, and representatives of M/s. Secure Value India Ltd., a logistics firm contracted to move and refill cash in ATMs, diverted the money to private individuals. Umashankar Renuka gave Rs. 1.30 crore to Secure Value India Ltd, to refill 32 ATMs between November 8 and November 29, but the money was diverted to Ibrahim Shereef, S.C. Jayachandra, Nazeer Ahmed, Chandrakanth Ramalingam and some others. ED arrests S.C. Jayachandra The Enforcement Directorate (ED) arrested suspended Public Works Department engineer S.C. Jayachandra for allegedly laundering money and exchanging demonetised notes with new currency. He was remanded in police custody for five days. Another bureaucrat T.N. Chikkarayappa, whose house was also searched by I-T sleuths last week, is not part of the FIRs registered by either the CBI or ED as no new currency notes were recovered from his house. However, the Anti Corruption Bureau (ACB) of the State police has registered a Disproportionate Assets (DA) cases against him and S.C. Jayachandra, and initiated a probe. CBI arrests two middlemen The CBI on Sunday arrested two contractors Nazeer Ahmed and Chandrakanth Ramalingam for allegedly acting as middlemen for the illegal exchange of old currency with notes of Rs. 2,000 denomination. Ibrahim Shereef, another contractor, has emerged as one of the kingpins in the racket. He is absconding. I-T sleuths recovered Rs. 4.80 crore in Rs. 2,000 denomination notes from a flat owned by Ibrahim Shereef at Pebble Bay, RMV Extension II stage. All the seven persons named in the FIR have been booked for criminal conspiracy, cheating, misappropriation, forgery, falsification of accounts and criminal misconduct by public servants. Both CBI and ED have got custody of the persons till December 9. Scope of fraud likely to expand? The scope of the banking fraud is most likely to expand, both in terms of volume and the number of banks involved, sleuths told The Hindu. The CBI and the ED are working in tandem with the I-T department and RBI to track down the source of all the Rs. 2,000 denomination notes that I-T sleuths had seized. Sources said that at least two public sector banks banks in Tamil Nadu have already come under the scanner. Chandrakanth Ramalingam is suspected of being a middleman in these transactions too. M/s. Secure Value India Ltd., a Mumbai-based firm incorporated in 2012, was handling funds of 18 other banks in Bengaluru and Mumbai. Sleuths are probing the accounts of all these banks. Police hunt for key player Sleuths are on the hunt for Ibrahim Shereef. It was in his flat in Pebble Bay, RMV II Stage that new currency amounting to Rs. 4.8 crore was seized. According to sources, he is a well-known power broker, who is close to many politicians. He is from Thrithahalli in Shivamogga district and is a Class I contractor. Ibrahim Shereef has several flats in Pebble Bay. Most of them are said to be unoccupied. Sleuths suspect that the flats may be benami properties. It was from one such flat that the new currency was seized, sources said. Sleuths have seized the visitor entry registers and CCTV camera footage.

Demonetisation will be one of the 11-12 chapters likely this time,” a top government official said, requesting anonymity. While he agreed with the assessment of several economists and rating agencies that demonetisation would hit consumption in the short run, the official stressed that private consumption would bounce back soon. When asked if the increase in bank deposits due to demonetisation will allow for greater lending again for infrastructure projects and boost private investment, the official said this is an unlikely scenario. “Demonetisation does not address the private sector’s issues,” the official explained. “You have to address the non-performing assets issue, and the fact that private sector balance sheets are shot. Unless you do that, private investment will not come.” The official mooted that the best way to utilise the surplus generated due to demonetisation would be to deploy it for creating fresh capacity and assets. “A good practice if you have a wealth gain is to use it for capital purposes and not to try and convert a wealth gain into an income gain,” he said. “Essentially, you don’t want to spend out of this gain. You want to create assets. You can recapitalise the banks. But what you do with the money is a political call.” EOM Printable version | Jan 7, 2017 1:41:40 AM | http://www.thehindu.com/business/Economy/Economic-Survey-could-have-entire-chapter-on-demonetisation-Govt-official/article16764696.ece © The Hindu Following the withdrawal of high-value currency notes, activity at PoS terminals saw exponential growth, even as the number of new such machines installed has also gone up."

Dr. Isaac also denied the charge that he was involved in fear-mongering. He refuted Leader of the Opposition Ramesh Chennithala’s charge that the State lacked preparedness in addressing the crisis. He had apprised Union Finance Minister Arun Jaitley of the problems that were likely to arise due to cash crunch, held discussions with Reserve Bank of India personnel and the intent for daily cash requirement in the treasuries was placed after mutual discussions. The government had also made arrangements to ensure that payments were not delayed due to cash crunch. The problem was not with the preparations, but with the Centre’s decision to withdraw 86 per cent currency at one go. He accused the Centre of vitiating the atmosphere in holding discussions on Goods and Services Tax. Treasury update As per official statistics, the government sought Rs.89.25 crore from the RBI for making payments for the day, but got only Rs.69.63 crore.

950,2016-12-05,28.0,Revenue from property registration in district shrink on demonetization,"KOCHI: Demonetization of high-value currency notes in early November has brought down property registration in the district substantially. A senior Registration Department official said on Monday that the number of property registrations on a normal day used to be around 350 documents. However, post-demonetization, the number has come down to around a hundred documents a day. The week immediately following the announcement of demonetization on November 8, saw absolutely no registration activities as people appeared confused and had no valid currency to carry out the deals, said the official. This week has seen registration picking up but not at the levels before demonetization, the official added. He also said that registration of around a hundred property deeds, 30 to 40 registrations of wills and a few Powers of Attorney are registered these days during a day. It implies also that the volume of revenue realized from registration process is also down. Almost all the registration offices in the district met their annual revenue target last year. The targets were met despite several adverse factors. However, the volume of revenue is down to less than 60 per cent this year, the official added pointing out that demonetization was the immediate cause for the phenomenon. However, property developers have ruled out demonetization hitting real property deals and development because most of the housing deals are bank linked and depend on the loans extended by the banks. Document writers have pointed a clutch of factors that had affected property deals even before the demonetization announcement. The fall in the price of natural rubber, declining remittances from the Gulf countries on falling oil price and high rate of charges on registration had dissuaded people during most part of last year. The government’s decision to hike the fair value of property too had played a role in slowing down new property registrations. eom mka Printable version | Jan 7, 2017 1:41:44 AM | http://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/Revenue-from-property-registration-in-district-shrink-on-demonetization/article16764158.ece © The Hindu The venue is as much a draw as the exhibits at the Kochi Muziris biennale"
951,2016-12-05,28.0,Demonetisation hits liquor sale,"VISAKHAPATNAM: The demonetisation scheme that was announced by the Central government on November 8 has affected the sale of liquor across Visakhapatnam district and also in almost all districts in the State. In Visakhapatnam city alone, the sale has plummeted by about 35 to 40 per cent and in the rural areas it is down by about 30 to 35 per cent. The average sale in Visakhapatnam district is about Rs. 120 crore to Rs.130 crore per month and in the month of November it drops to around Rs.110 to Rs.120 crore, as the liquor consumption slows down due to ‘Karthika masam.’ But this year, the sales in the month of November dropped to about Rs. 99 crore compared to Rs. 123 crore last year, according to a senior officer from the Prohibition and Excise Department. “The last week of November was the worst hit, as from November 24 the retailers completely stopped accepting the bigger denomination notes of Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,000, which ceased to be legal tenders, as per the government order,” he said. Withdrawal of bigger denomination notes from circulation, lack of money in banks, withdrawal from banks being curtailed and lack of small change with retailers are cited as the reasons for the downtrend. A senior officer from East Godavari aired a similar view and according to him there is an overall drop of about 40 per cent in revenue across all the districts in the State. Despite drop in sales, the purchases by the retailers from the state-owned depots have gone up. It is estimated that the average monthly purchase for the month of November has gone up by about 10 to 20 per cent. In East Godavari district the purchase of beer in the month of November in 2015 stood at about 93,000 cases, and in the corresponding period this year, it was 1.20 lakh cases. Senior officers indicate that retailers used the opportunity to dispose of the old Rs. 500 and Rs. 1000 notes to purchase the stock, despite the sales being less. To support the traders, the government has removed the ‘minimum monthly sales’ clause from November, till normalcy is restored, says a liquor shop owner. Moreover, the government has asked the retailers to pay the quarterly licence fee in advance and many had used this opportunity to exchange the old notes by paying the fee in advance. But the excise officials feel that the dip in the sales is a temporary phenomenon and it will bounce back this month.

Chikkarayappa, has not been named in the CBI FIR, since IT sleuths recovered no new currency from his house. Mr. Jayachandra was yet to be questioned by CBI in the case, sources said. CBI is still grilling two bank officials — Suryanarayana Bairy, chief manager, Karnataka Bank, Indiranagar branch, Umashankar, Branch Manager, Dhanalaxmi Bank, JC Road branch and Ravi Goel, Managing Director, M/s. SecureValue India Ltd., a logistics firm with contracts to refill ATM kiosks in the city. CBI FIR clearly narrates the role of the three in providing new currency of Rs. 2000 denomination in black to the bureaucrats and the contractors. A banking fraud The FIR narrates two kinds of banking frauds involved — diversion of new currency using falsified identity documents to misrepresent exchange at banks before November 24 and diversion of money meant for ATM kiosks leaving them dry. The FIR based on source information reveals that Suryanarayana Bairy, Chief Manager, Karnataka Bank, Indiranagar branch, connived with the contractors and other accused and fraudulently diverted new currency notes, all in Rs. 2000 denomination, to other accused through unknown middlemen/agents. The FIR further said that the initial facility provided for exchange of demonetised old currency to new at banks was misused by Mr. Bairy to divert new currency in the black. Mr. Bairy is alleged to have “falsified the accounts of his bank on the basis of forged and fabricated documents of identity and address proof in the names of several individuals to misrepresent that the new currency notes were exchanged with the general public at the bank counters.” The exchange of currency notes at the bank counters was withdrawn on November 24. The FIR doesn’t mention as to what volume of currency did Mr. Bairy divert into the black market and he dealt with whom. Monies for ATM diverted In another modus operandi, defrauding the bank customers, the CBI FIR alleges that Umashankar Renuka, branch manager, Dhanalaxmi Bank, JC Road branch and representatives of M/s. Secure Value India Ltd., a logistics firm contracted to move and refill cash to ATM machines, diverted the money to private individuals. Umashankar Renuka gave a total of Rs. 1.30 crore to Secure Value India Ltd, to refill 32 ATMs between November 8 and November 29, which was diverted and paid to Ibrahim Shereef, S.C. Jayachandra, Nazeer Ahmed, Chandrakanth Ramalingam and unknown others. As per the FIR Secure Value India Ltd. is said to have diverted currency from other banks with which they had money transport contracts into the black market, for a hefty commission. All the seven accused have now been booked for criminal conspiracy, cheating, misappropriation, forgery, falsification of accounts and criminal misconduct by public servants.

953,2016-12-05,28.0,?Demonetisation is a road to nowhere?,"Viduthalai Chiruthaigal Katchi (VCK) leader Thol. Thirumavalavan   Viduthalai Chiruthaigal Katchi (VCK) leader Thol. Thirumavalavan on Sunday said while the people in the country are ready to subject themselves to any hardship to eradicate black money, demonetisation was not a solution as it was a flawed concept. Mr. Thirumavalavan’s stand is in stark contrast to the one taken by MDMK leader and People’s Welfare Front (PWF) convener Vaiko, who has been pretty vocal in his support of the demonetisation scheme. The VCK and the two Left parties are part of the PWF. “People are ready to even forego food if the government’s effort will result in putting an end to black money. But demonetisation will take us nowhere. On the other hand, it is helping small black money holders to covert their currencies into white through banks. The suspension of bank officials and a few individuals obtaining new currencies in bulk prove my argument,” Mr. Thirumavalavan told The Hindu. The Dalit leader said black money had become part of Indian political and electoral system and privatisation had made the situation worse. “Unless you reform the political and electoral system, you cannot eradicate black money. Today, the situation has come to such a pass that political parties cannot function without black money and elections cannot be won without bribing voters,” he said. According to him, the private sector was thriving in the country only on black money and self-financing educational institutions proliferated by collecting capitation fee and donations. “Everyone knows that parents have to pay several lakhs of rupees to get an engineering seat in private colleges and the price for a medical seat has touched one crore rupees. Parents pay the money under the table and this is nothing but black money. Has the government taken any steps to stop commercialisation of education in the country which in turn helped a few individuals amassing black money and foraying into other business ventures,” he asked. Mr. Thirumavalavan did not agree that Prime Minister Narendra Modi kept his decision on demonetisation as a secret to prevent even his colleagues from getting wind of it. “Now, it has come to light that the address he made to the nation was a recorded speech. What is the guarantee that those who had recorded the speech had not revealed it to others? If he is under compulsion to keep such a serious issue as a secret, does he agree that he cannot trust even his Cabinet colleagues or say that they are agents of black money holders,” he wanted to know. It was laughable if the Indian government, with its powerful government machinery and adequate laws, was not able to zero-in on black money holders and had to resort to demonetisation. “Even a layman knows who is holding black money in his area and the government, instead of targeting them, has taken a circuitous route,” he charged. Asked about the difference of opinion among the partners of the PWF, particularly Mr. Vaiko, he said they had agreed to disagree. “We will work together on issues when there is a consensus. There is no need to discuss about an issue which eludes a consensus. The VCK and the MDMK share the same stand on the Sri Lankan Tamil issue and the LTTE. But the Left parties approach it from a different angle and it has not created any wedge between us,” he said.

| Photo Credit: T_Singaravelou Chief Minister V. Narayanasamy on Sunday said that Puducherry has incurred a loss of 15 per cent in trade because of the demonetisation move. Addressing the media on Sunday in the Assembly building, he said: “The business transaction of traders has come down from Rs. 5 lakh to Rs. 50,000. The industrial production has been affected. People who have deposited Rs. 2 lakh are able to withdraw only Rs. 2,000. The unorganised sectors and rural population have been affected the most. The farmers are worst hit as they are unable to buy seeds or fertilisers.” Mr. Narayanasamy said he had urged the Centre to compensate the tax losses incurred by the States because of demonetisation. “The RBI can print only Rs. 30 crore a month as against the requirement of Rs. 14 lakh crore. This problem will not be resolved in a year,” he added. He said at least 57 people have died during this period. “I support the Prime Minister’s intention to eradicate black money. But they have declared 86 per cent of the cash invalid and failed to make any alternative arrangements. There is no money in the banks,” he said. “Out of the 130 crore people, only 40 crore people use plastic money while the rest are still dependent on cash,” he said. He said that during a recent meeting on the GST at the Centre, he was able to convince the Finance Minister to provide compensation for the loss incurred by Puducherry. Gas pipeline Under the Ennore to Kanyakumari gas pipeline project, the Puducherry government has requested the Centre to provide piped gas supply to Puducherry and Karaikal. “In the Andhra gas pipeline project that would connect 18 districts, Yanam has the possibility of getting connected,” he said. The Chief Minister said the government was determined to implement 3 per cent reservation for the people with disability in education and employment. He underscored that the government had sanctioned Rs. 527 crore per annum to buy power from Neyveli and Central power grid. Agricultural University The Chief Minister said the agricultural college in Karaikal would be upgraded to State agricultural university. “This would help in further research in the field,” he said. Puducherry government was going to call for a global tender for waste management. He said the U.S. and Chinese companies had shown interest in providing machinery required to convert waste into compost. “Using that technology, we could use the waste dumped in 15 acres of land. This process will economically benefit the government. Earlier, we had planned to burn the waste, which would incur an expenditure of Rs. 17 crore. However, the new waste management plan will not have any loss. The government has taken up the initiative to build toilets in the rural and urban areas of the Union Territory of Puducherry.” The MHRD had agreed to consider the demand for setting up an Institute of Management in Puducherry, Mr. Narayanasamy said.

Speaking at the inaugural session of the 48th regional conference of Southern Indian Regional Council (SIRC) of Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (ICAI) held at Sri Venkateswara Veterinary University (SVVU) grounds here on Tuesday, they remarked that it would definitely have a telling impact on the nation’s economy. “It is a welcome step by the Central government to address the issues such as black money, fake currency and funding for terrorist organisations. For the sake of national security and inclusive growth, we have urged all our members to guide their clients and the general public in the right direction,” asserted ICAI Chairman M. Devaraja Reddy. Mr. Reddy further said that though there might be a few problems in the beginning, the decision of demonetisation would augur well in the long run. He called upon various branch heads to conduct awareness programmes in all the 44 centres in South India, and also elucidate on other prevailing issues. He also emphasised on CAs updating their respective skills and working towards upholding the trust of the people. Chittoor MP N. Sivaprasad, who presided over, urged the chartered accountants to contribute their part in allaying the fears of common man by spreading awareness on the issue. “Though a great step, the withdrawal of Rs. 500 and Rs.1,000 currency notes, has put people in a state of confusion. In this context, the financial experts should explain the reason behind the decision to the people,” he remarked. Tirupati Legislator M. Suguna further emphasised on the need for conducting awareness programmes to promote financial literacy along with the prevailing developments. The two-day conference focuses on the issues such as demonetisation, updates on Goods and Service Tax (GST), Income Declaration Scheme (IDS), issues related to audit firms, accounting reforms in railways, few pilot studies, certificate courses and much more. SIRC Chairman E. Phalguna Kumar, Canara Bank Chairman T.N. Manoharan, Amara Raja Group Chairman Galla Ramachandra Naidu and representatives from various branches took part in the conference on the first day.

The world may be moving towards a cashless economy but in India, in view of the social structure, social milieu and people’s habits, cash transactions would continue,” he said while addressing journalists on the sidelines of his first weekly ‘Lok Samvad’ interaction. In this programme, Mr. Kumar seeks feedback and suggestions on his government’s development and welfare programmes from a group of people on the first three Mondays of the month. On Monday, 34 people from different districts of the State provided feedback on issues such as irrigation, roads, construction and energy. ‘BJP should answer’ Mr. Kumar added, “There have recently been documentary disclosures by the Janata Dal-United (JD-U) leaders on land purchases made by the BJP (Bharatiya Janata Party) in Bihar. The BJP should answer the charges made against them. Whose money was it? From where has it come?” He added, “The State’s land registration department will look into it but it has not come to my level yet.” On the question of Union Minister Giriraj Singh’s proposal for sterilisation to control population in the country, the Bihar Chief Minister said, “It is all frivolous talk. What happened to all those who had earlier advocated for sterilisation? There are several central and State government programmes for this. Population can be controlled through education and not by sterilisation”.

| Photo Credit: BASHEER The Andhra Chambers of Commerce and Industries Federation strongly felt that the demonetisation policy of the Union government would boost the economy in the long run and help entrepreneurs get loans at lower interest rates. The federation felt that huge cash flows at banks would benefit entrepreneurs to get loans at affordable rates. It is also hopeful that the transparency would come at every level and make way for industrial progress in the State. The organisation asked the government to come with simple taxation policy to achieve the goals of demonetisation. Federation president-elect G. Sambasiva Rao said that demonetisation policy might lead to cash crunch initially but flow of money would be normal within a couple of months. “Currently, the industries are facing many difficulties with higher interest rates. It is the time for the government to extend support to us by lowering interest rates by 2 per cent. We hope it would be possible for the government to do so with the huge cash flow which can be used for industrial growth in the country. It naturally boost the economy and create a huge number of jobs,” he added. According to him, The federation requested the Union and the the State governments to focus on agro-based industries in Srikakulam and Vizianagaram districts for creation of more jobs in rural areas and arrest the migration of people. It urged the government to crate infrastructure such as road connectivity to industries and storage points. “By-products of cashew, coconut, maize and other varieties are ignored completely with the lack of guidance and technological support. Local farmers can become entrepreneurs if these are provided. Marketing will be not a major issue since Srikakulam and Vizianagaram have wonderful train and road connectivity to export their finished goods to other States,” said Mr.Sambasiva Rao. He asked the government to establish various clusters for the promotion of agro-based industries in backward districts of the State. “Many people can start their units with a minimum investment of ₹ 5 lakh. The entrepreneurs can be successful in their ventures when they don’t depend absolutely on government subsidy and tax relations. However, they might help them for future expansion plans,” Mr. Sambasiva Rao added. He assured that the federation would have an interaction session with the officials concerned at both the district and the State-level for the economic prosperity of backward Vizianagaram and Srikakulam districts.

Senior Congress leader and leader of the Opposition in the State Legislative Assembly, Radhakrishna Vikhe Patil, gave a notice of adjournment on demonetisation and demanded immediate discussion on the issue as the House did not have question hour in its schedule on Monday. Mr. Vikhe-Patil said, “People all over the State are facing difficulties due to the note ban. We support this decision to stop corruption, but are against the way it is being implemented. Common people, especially small farmers, are badly hit. This decision should have disturbed corrupt people but only the common people are facing hardships. The government’s administration, devoid of planning, has suffocated people. Many in the ruling party are opposed to this decision but they can’t speak their mind because of the Central government’s pressure on them. Prices of almost every farm produce are down due to this note ban. The government has to come clear on this.” The Nationalist Congress Party leader Mr. Ajit Pawar claimed that the 125-crore population of India supported action against black money holders. In the Upper House, Dhananjay Munde, Leader of the Opposition in the State Council, alleged that the demonetisation drive has cost the State’s farmers Rs. 20,000 crore. “The rates of agricultural produce have fallen drastically. Labourers are not being paid as no cash is available with farmers and with the Rabi season, sowing has hit hard as no cash is available with them. We want to know what steps the government has taken to ease pressure from the rural economy,” said Mr. Munde. Congress leader Narayan Rane blamed the government of using demonetisation to divert the attention of people from its failures to deliver on election promises, which led to a verbal altercation between him and Finance Minister Sudhir Mungantiwar. In the Assembly, Haribhau Bagde denied permission for an adjournment motion, which infuriated Opposition members, while in the Upper House, Mr. Naik-Nimbalkar too denied permission to conduct the discussion on the first day. Mr. Mungantiwar tried to pacify the Opposition by conceding that the people were facing “some problems” while implanting this “historic decision”.

A visibly infuriated Mr. Mungantiwar argued with with the man who had interrupted his speech, asked him his name and said he could identify his political affiliation in a minute. The minister also claimed that other participants in the programme — former Maharashtra finance minister and NCP leader Jayant Patil, Shiv Sena leader Neelam Gorhe, AAP leader Ashutosh and Congress leader Sanjay Nirupam — had brought their supporters with them, while he had come alone. “Conflicting statements are coming from the Opposition members on demonetisation, but common people have accepted the change. Everyone except our political opponents have welcomed this step. We agree that this won’t result in a cashless society, but it can result in less cash,” Mr. Mungantiwar said, adding he had come for an academic discussion, not a political one. Aam Admi Party (AAP) leader and former journalist Ashutosh took a dig at Mr. Mungantiwar, saying people had the right to ask questions in a democracy: “Should we stop asking questions? We, the leaders, should show some sensitivity. But alarm bells are ringing now because this Prime Minster has not addressed a single press conference in two-and-a-half years.” Ms. Gorhe said the audience’s political affiliations did not matter. “The important thing is that they are all Indians,” she added.

In a statement, they said the rollback apart, the government should announce compensation to the kin of those who died of heart seizures and other reasons while they were standing in long queues at bank branches and ATMs since November 8 to withdraw their own, hard-earned money. They said while one did not actually know how much those with loads of black money were hit, the everyday suffering of the common man was clearly seen. Worst-hit were those 70 per cent living in rural areas and 95 per cent of population who work in the unorganised sector for whom cash is an everyday requirement. “In a country like India with such a demographic proportion, it was simply unthinkable,” they said, pointing out while in no country had demonetisation had led to a phenomenal growth in the economy, even those nations where black money was present had not taken such a drastic move. On one hand if the the poor were affected and livelihoods shattered without work everyday, even those who had money in their accounts could not take it out for health emergencies and other dire needs, they said.

A decision of this kind carries the pain of transition. This is regrettable, but it was expected.” “When you are in a cusp of history and you look at the long-term impact of these steps which are going to be taken, I think India is going to become a society in the long term with a certainly better GDP, cleaner ethics, a cleaner economy,” he added. Cash shortage The Finance Minister admitted that there was a shortage of cash and that was what made the parallel shift to electronic transactions so important. “In these 2-3 months, India will move digital,” he said. “We will achieve far more than what we have achieved in the past few decades. What we will end up achieving is to lay down a new normal.” The benefit of this new normal, he said, was the increased money in the banking system, and the greater ability of banks to support the economy. Regarding the Goods and Services Tax and the ongoing deadlock in the GST Council over the required legislation, Mr. Jaitley said that most of the issues had been resolved and that the final draft of the legislation was being worked out. “One issue is pending,” he added. “Since all taxes are being merged into a single tax, the issue is of how to reconcile it with the parallel machinery in the Centre and the States.” “I am hoping that all issues will be resolved soon,” he said.

| Photo Credit: K. Bhagya Prakash The former Prime Minister H.D. Deve Gowda spoke to Smita Gupta on the impact of demonetisation and the evolving political situation. In a recent speech, you compared the Emergency imposed by Indira Gandhi to the current situation following demonetisation... When banks were nationalised and privy purses abolished, the people thought this major step taken by Indira Gandhi would benefit the poor and solve the unemployment problem… In the 1971 Parliament elections, she won a two-thirds majority; in 1972, after the Assembly elections, almost all the States came under the Congress umbrella; there was virtually no Opposition in the country. People believed in Indira Gandhi’s slogans, garibi hatao, berojgari hatao. In 1971, she was at her peak. But within just three years, in Nagpur when she went to address a public meeting where she announced the slogan of a curb on consumption, people pounced on her and the police had to escort her out. What are your objections to the demonetisation decision? On November 17, I wrote to the Prime Minister, welcoming the move but said it had been done without a proper assessment of the situation. From November 8 to now, several alterations have been made; now the amendments to the Taxation Bill have created confusion. My concern is will these steps yield the expected results? If it does, then Modi will be a great leader. If he can achieve his dreams of a Digital India, cashless economy, within six months, certainly I will bow my head. If this demonetisation succeeds, he will be the unquestioned leader. If it fails, he will be destroyed. What about the long term impact on the economy? The GDP is going to go down. The value of the rupee could fluctuate. If within six months things don’t settle down, and digital India is not put in place, the problems will increase. Unemployment will grow — people in the unorgansised sector will be hit. But there’s no social unrest yet. No political party has provoked the situation in anyState; only Mamata Banerjee has taken a tough stand in public meetings and has spoken of a financial emergency. She’s a fighter. She has not accumulated any money; she probably has half a dozen khadi saris and is living in the same house as she was when she first entered Parliament. People speak of the Sarada scam, the chit funds in Bengal, but she’s a fighter. The people are with her. Is it time for a Third Front? I don’t want to jump to conclusions that there will be a Third Front tomorrow. Circumstances will create the situation ... if there is an adverse impact of demonetisation, then the people will put pressure on political parties. People are tolerant.

965,2016-12-07,30.0,BJP Chooses Maratha reservation to counter Opposition?s attack on demonetisation,"To counter the Opposition’s charge of shoddy implementation of demonetisation, the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and Shiv Sena coalition has decided to use the Maratha reservation issue to corner the Congress-Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) in the ongoing winter session of the State Legislature. As Nagpur gets ready to witness possibly one of the biggest Maratha rallies ever held in the State on December 14, the ruling parties appear to have decided to make good use of the opportunity to corner the Maratha vote bank ahead of the forthcoming Zilla Parishad and Municipal Corporation elections. In the Assembly, BJP MLA Ashish Shelar, Dr. Sanjay Kute, among others, along with the Shiv Sena’s Sunil Prabhu, Shambhuraj Desai and others have moved a resolution demanding reservation for the Maratha community. In the Council, the BJP’s Pravin Darekar, Sujitsinh Thakur and the Sena’s Dr. Neelam Gorhe, Shivsangram’s Vinayaka Mete, along with others, moved a similar resolution. According to sources in the ruling coalition, the move has ensured that the Opposition does not get to take the credit of highlighting the issue in the Legislature. “If the Opposition continues to disrupt proceedings on the demonetisation issue, we can always claim that the government was ready to discuss and pass the resolution supporting Maratha reservation,” said a BJP MLA on condition of anonymity. The resolution was to be discussed on Tuesday. However, with adjournment of both Houses, following a condolence resolution over the death of former Tamil Nadu Chief Minister Jayalalitha, it is likely to come up for debate either on Wednesday or in the coming week. Meanwhile, Education Minister Vinod Tawde on Tuesday said the government has filed a 2,500-page affidavit in the Bombay High Court, presenting evidence to prove the Maratha community is socially, educationally and economically backward. Government pleader Abhinandan Vagyani submitted the affidavit, that says 82 per cent of the people from the community are socially and financially backward. It therefore seeks reservation in government jobs and educational institutions for the community. The affidavit points out that the Marathas are mostly sugarcane cutters, migrant labourers, head loaders and maid servants. Mr. Vagyani said most of the farmers who committed suicide in Maharashtra over the past few years belonged to this community. The Supreme Court has said that reservation can exceed 50 per cent in exceptional circumstances, he added. The affidavit relies on several documents and records, speeches made by Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar, references about the community in devotional and folk songs and religious texts by saint-poets such as Sant Tukaram, Bahinabai and Samarth Ramdas. It names Shahu Maharaj, Mahatma Jyotiba Phule and Ambedkar in support of the claim that the Maratha community is underprivileged and backward. A division bench of Chief Justice Manjula Chellur and Justice M S Sonak will hear public interest litigations opposing the Congress-NCP government’s decision to grant 16 per cent reservation to Marathas as well as some petitions in favour of it, on December 7. “This affidavit will strongly present the government’s side supporting reservation for Marathas. We are sure we will win this judicial battle,” Mr. Vagyani said.

Alice Gillett (77) came across a copy of The Microscope and its Revelations written by Dr. William B. Carpenter, while clearing through her late husband’s possessions from Taunton, Somerset in England, a media letter said on Thursday. 1000-page tome While turning the pages of the 1,000-page book, she discovered a date stamp showing it was borrowed from the library of Hereford Cathedral School in 1886, Metro.co.uk reported. It had been loaned to her grandfather Professor Arthur E. Boycott, who attended the school between 1886 and 1894. He was a distinguished naturalist and pathologist, the report said. Ms. Gillett returned the book to the school along with an apology letter. “I am sorry to inform you that one of your former pupils, Professor A.E. Boycott appears to have stolen the enclosed — I can’t imagine how the school has managed without it!,” she wrote in the letter. She was lucky not to be fined The school does not charge for overdue books but if they had, Ms. Gillett could have been landed with a bill of 7,446 pounds ($9,463) — based on a 17p-a-day charge at most libraries, the report said. Ms. Gillett said: “As a child, he [Boycott] took great interest in natural history, and his particular passion was snails. At age 15, he published his first paper listing the snail species that could be found in Herefordshire.” He also had a fascination with fauna and flora made him quite a hazardous driver because he was so obsessed with observing the hedgerows, she said. He had snails in his pockets “My grandmother said he always had snails in his pockets,”Ms. Gillett said.

In a series of tweets, Mr. Modi spoke about the benefits of demonetisation. He said the country had a “historic opportunity” to embrace increased cashless payments. “I salute the people of India for wholeheartedly participating in this ongoing ‘yagna’ against corruption, terrorism & black money,” he said. “Together, we must ensure #IndiaDefeatsBlackMoney. This will empower the poor, neo-middle class, middle class & benefit future generations,” he observed. “I always said that the government’s measure will bring a degree of inconvenience but this short term pain will pave way for long term gains,” he asserted. The decision had several gains for farmers, traders, labourers, “who are the economic backbone of our nation” and “no longer will the progress and prosperity of rural India be curtailed by corruption & black money. Our villages must get their due.” He went on to add, “We also have a historic opportunity to embrace increased cashless payments & integrate latest technology in economic transactions.” Printable version | Jan 7, 2017 1:42:33 AM | http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/Its-almost-a-month-and-Modi-insists-demonetisation-is-only-a-short-term-pain/article16777309.ece © The Hindu Be it nature’s fury or man’s folly, destructions are alike.

   Union Minister M Venkaiah Naidu has hit out the opposition for observing a ‘Black Day’ today to mark one month of demonetisation, saying they are actually observing “Black Money Support Day“. “Our opponents particularly the Congress I am told are observing a Black Day. I say what they are observing is a ’Black Money Support Day’ “Dharna by opposition parties near Gandhi statute in Parliament premises is a big ‘tamasha’ and an insult to the Father of Nation,” Naidu said. Opposition parties are observing ‘Black Day’ today to mark completion of a month of the demonetisation announcement. As part of the protests, the opposition leaders also held a dharna at Gandhi statue in Parliament premises. The minister observed that praise has poured in from abroad as well on the demonetisation decision. “I don’t understand why some people are observing black day. I can’t understand,” he added. While Congress leaders are gathering near the Gandhi statue in the Parliament, the party was “moving away” from the spirit of the Mahatma, he said. Not allowing Parliament to function only reflects .“contempt” of democracy, he told reporters at a photo exhibition organised by photojournalists.

970,2016-12-08,31.0,'What demonetisation has done no amount of cash offers can do',"Vijay Shekhar Sharma
 
| Photo Credit: Ramesh Sharma Due to a cash crunch following the government’s move to demonetise Rs.500 and Rs.1,000 currency notes, mobile wallets like Paytm have seen a phenomenal spike in adoption. Vijay Shekhar Sharma, the founder of Paytm talks to The Hindu about the use of Prime Minister’s photo for their advertisement, the company’s upcoming payment banks and enhancing application security. Paytm has seen a big uptick in usage due to demonetisation. How has the offline usage risen? Offline has become huge for us. Almost 65 per cent transactions are now offline for us. We have added nearly a million QR codes at point of sale during the past month. We have issued about three million such point of sales in total. As far as digital payments go, offline shops in India are so deprived… it is a big opportunity and that is why we continue to expand. We are signing up new merchants aggressively. We signed thousands of petrol pumps in last few days. We are targeting that every petrol pump in the country gets this option and for every gas cylinder distribution too there is an option to pay digitally. I believe the push and attention that demonetisation is giving to digital payments, no amount of marketing and offers such as discounts and cash backs could have done this. How much did you spend on marketing in November? Last month, we spent around Rs.250 crore. On a yearly basis, we have a marketing budget of around Rs.600 crore, which comes down to about Rs.50 crore a month. Did Paytm have the approval from Prime Minister’s Office for using the picture of Prime Minister Narendra Modi in advertisements? As Paytm, we sort of applauded our PM for an act which will benefit all fintech start-ups. While this is a great opportunity from the perspective of black money and so on, I believe that the PM has kicked off the golden age for fintech companies. That is what we did. We got to work as soon as the announcement was made, printing of newspapers got delayed...We managed to get ad only in three papers. So would you say all the approvals were in place when you printed the ad? We talked about it… All I can say is we did talk about it with the necessary authorities that we are doing it tomorrow. What about the uptake in rural areas, where there are no smartphones? One of the most important learning for us from demonetisation was the need for technology for people without smartphones or Internet. Everybody knows how to make a call. We have introduced a toll-free number 180018001234, which users can call to transfer money. They simply need to dial the toll-free number from registered mobile, enter the recipient’s mobile number, amount and their Paytm PIN…transferring money is as easy as making a call. Paytm doesn’t require a passcode right now, so if one loses his/her phone, Paytm account could be misused. Also, a lot of app permissions that Paytm asks for are not listed on the app permissions page on your website. We have just added a passcode feature. So, now people will be to use any of the passwords that they have for smartphones — be it a pattern, fingerprint or a password, before they make a payment. If your device goes into someone else’s hand they won’t be able to misuse it. The application will use the same password as for the Android device so users don’t need to remember an additional password. The permissions we take and why we take them, are listed explicitly. We will make sure that a permission which is not explained on the webpage, is removed. What is the logic behind the integration of wallets and Payments Bank? When we had applied for a payments bank license we had consented to the RBI that we will keep both under the same entity, which is the Paytm Payments Bank. That is why wallets are moving to payment bank…. We just can’t wait to start, so we have begun with informing the consumers about the integration through a notice. The notice also added that the way people use their wallets will not change but wallets will now be issued not One97 Communication Ltd but by Paytm Payments Bank Ltd. Who all are the investors in Paytm Payments Bank? Paytm bank will have two investors – me and One97 Communications. This is more Indian than any other financial services company in the country. I have sold my shares in Paytm so that I can fund independently and I have done Rs. 112 crore right now. So, we have capitalised about Rs 200 crore now and plan to do Rs 400 crore. So, we will put more money in the company. When can we expect the bank to roll? Any tentative timeline? Payments Bank is in its final leg. We are going through different pre-launch processes. Once license comes, there will be a few more things to do. We have also built a few product partnerships related to financial services such as wealth management and investment products, but they also need to be approved. March is the deadline for the bank, anyways. So, we have to launch it in the first quarter of 2017. What about the network of business correspondents? We already have 60,000 Paytm partners, out of which we will build a business correspondents network. Earlier, we had a plan of limited roll-out. But with demonetisation creating a brand recall for us and services now reaching every nook and corner, we will be building the BC network aggressively.

971,2016-12-08,31.0,Farmers facing the brunt of demonetisation,"The Toor farmers of Vijayapura district facing double whammy, the drought and the cash crunch due to demonetization
  Deficient rain had reduced the yield of toor dal by around 40 per cent. Rudrappa Pawar, a farmer of Kumatagi village of the taluk, had hoped that at least the remaining crop would fetch him some money. However, despite selling the crop in an open market, Mr. Pawar had to return empty-handed only with a promise that his Rs. 45,000 would be given to him after fifteen days. “The trader, to whom I have been selling my grains for several years now, said that since the government had banned Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,000 notes, he did not have enough money to pay me. So, he has given me a promissory note saying he will pay the money in fifteen days,” he said. This is the hard reality of the farmers in the region. It is a double whammy for them – on one hand, drought has affected their crop yield, on the other, demonetisation has hit their earnings. With toor being sowed across over four lakh hectares of land in the district this kharif season, harvesting has already begun in many parts. However, on delivering the commodity to the traders, farmers are walking away with promises instead of money. “The traders either pay post-dated cheques to farmers who have bank accounts, or promise to pay them after a few days. If we insist on payments, the traders pay us small amounts in cash. What about farmers who do not have bank accounts? They are the ones who are at the receiving end in this crisis,” Mr. Pawar said. The farmers say that without cash, they are unable to buy seeds for the rabi season. Meanwhile, the traders have their own reasons for not paying cash after purchase. They say that after demonetisation, they have limited cash in hand. Therefore they are giving out post-dated cheques or promissory notes to farmers.

972,2016-12-08,31.0,Demonetisation is for the long run,"The critics of demonetisation are absolutely right about the adverse short-term impact of the policy. It has caused major inconvenience to a vast majority, particularly to those who have the least financial resources. Of course, it will shave off some amount of GDP growth for anywhere between a quarter and three quarters because of the economic disruption it has caused in different sectors of the economy. According to some, including the venerable Dr. Manmohan Singh, this alone is sufficient to damn demonetisation. After all, the short run is all that matters because in the long run, as Keynes famously said, we are all dead. While that proposition may be true for individuals, it certainly isn’t true for nations. India has a long-term future even if you and I don’t. Also, there is a medium term, longer than an electoral cycle or two (certainly longer than a quarter or two) but shorter than a generation (say, 30 years). The real impact of demonetisation must be weighed in the medium/long term.  Amartya Sen terms demonetisation a despotic action India’s economic progress is at an inflexion point. Twenty five years of liberalisation have yielded far superior outcomes for almost every Indian than four and a half decades of socialism did. But the gradual opening of markets with continued, substantial government control over the economy also unleashed a virulent strain of crony (and indeed phoney) capitalism at about the same time that India grew at its fastest between 2003 and 2012. Rules and fairness were simply cast aside. The policy paralysis in United Progressive Alliance 2 and the spectacular downfall of a government that had won an unprecedented second consecutive full term in office (a first post-1991) was a backlash against cronyism and loot. It is to Narendra Modi’s credit that he was able to separate the virtues of capitalism from the pitfalls of crony capitalism in his campaign for India’s highest office. Thus the rhetoric of minimum government (pro-market) went hand in hand with the rhetoric against black money and illicit wealth accumulation (anti-crony). But the sustainability of pro-market policies is only feasible if there is a firm stamping out of cronyism. Otherwise, it is easy for public perception to view any pro-market policy as pro-business and pro-crony. Eventually, if that perception makes strong roots, India’s relative economic success over the last quarter century could be quickly eroded by a populist backlash. It is, therefore, important to put demonetisation in the context of this political economy. The reason that opinion polls and anecdotal evidence continue to suggest the popularity of the move despite the obvious hardships is because it is perceived as a decisive act against the crooked — those who made their money unscrupulously and then chose to hide it — not the rich/well-off who earned legitimately and paid their taxes.  Government’s demonetisation move faces legal challenge This is no throwback to Indira Gandhi-style socialist populism. For a start, it is not confiscatory — your money remains yours provided you are willing to disclose it. More importantly, Prime Minister Modi remains committed to markets and entrepreneurship of the rules-based variety. That commitment is evident in other policy measures being implemented. The removal of discretion in the auctioning of all natural resources has already happened. There is a move to technology-enabled transparency elsewhere in government. Unsurprisingly, there has been no corruption scandal even as the government completes half its tenure. There is a new emphasis on the “personal” sector (moving away from a singular obsession with public sector or private sector jobs to productive self-employment), through schemes like Start up India and Stand-up India and through a commitment to get the government out of the business of doing business. But the success of all of that depends on rooting out the hold of crony capitalists in the system. Demonetisation is an important step in dislocating those who don’t play by the rules of the game. It is often asked why politicians have failed to make a case for the free market in India. At least part of the answer lies in the widespread cronyism which gives the free market a bad name. If any politician is ever to make that case — and for now Mr. Modi seems the likeliest to do so — he or she has to eliminate crony capitalism. A system will be viewed as fair if no individual or business is able to manipulate the rules of the game whether in terms of gaining favours from the government or by evading taxes. Free markets and capitalism will get mass public support if everyone is on a level playing field and when the rich/well off pay their taxes which can then be used to invest in those left behind so that they too have an opportunity to rise. It is only a rule-based capitalism — sans cronies and phonies — combined with a clean government that can transform India. It is said that the quality of India’s democracy is what give it an edge over authoritarian China. That will hold true if democracy delivers a rules-based capitalism and efficient government. It is a tortuous path but few nations in history have got there easily. That is why a long-term view is important. It is easy to be cynical and say that demonetisation will not alter the behaviour of the crooked. It may not change everyone but it will nudge a certain number in the right direction — to pay taxes, to transact without cash. More importantly, demonetisation will rebuild the faith of a disenchanted people in staying invested in a system that is rotten but that can still become fairer for all. The crooks don’t have the keys to power and influence in perpetuity. That’s an important message as India aspires to a prosperity for all.

973,2016-12-09,32.0,"Demonetisation may lead to higher drop in growth next year, fears Basu","Professor Kaushik Basu apeaks on ‘The Economics of Corruption, Black Money and Demonetisation’ at IIT Bombay on Friday.
 
| Photo Credit: Rajendra G Mumbai: The long-term effects of the demonetisation of Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,000 notes could be felt only next year, Prof. Kaushik Basu, former chief economist of the World Bank, said while delivering the third N.R. Kamath Chair lecture at the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Bombay on Friday. Going to the extent of calling for a roll back of the recall of just the 500-rupee currency notes, he said that while people may get angry, “some damage may be curbed”. Prof. Basu, who was also the chief economic advisor to the Union government in 2012, said demonetisation was done “for the right reasons” and appreciated the fact that there was no corruption at the “absolute top”. However, he feared that the Indian economy may suffer the next year by way of an even higher drop in growth than the estimated 6.9 per cent this year. Already, India’s service sector, which contributes 60 per cent to the country’s GDP, is beginning to feel the heat. In the long run, the snaking queues may seem like a smaller problem, he warned. Drawing a parallel with Brazil, Prof. Basu said the South American country’s attempts to eliminate corruption had made investors jittery of putting money into any company, as every second firm was going under investigation. “A year later, you realise you are trying to replace a system that is irreplaceable in a top-down method,” he said. India’s worst post-Independence economic growth was in 1979-80, which was attributed to poor rains and other factors, and “maybe some role” was played by the demonetisation of the 1,000-rupee notes by the Morarji Desai government the year before, he said. Prof. Basu drew attention to the shortfall in currency notes in circulation post-demonetisation. While old notes amounting to Rs. 12 lakh crore have been ploughed back into the system so far, new notes worth only Rs. 6 lakh crore have been generated. This could lead to a drop in demand and lending, among other issues. At the same time, he urged the government to take up the issue of corruption, suggesting measures such as cleansing the legal system of several archaic laws, imposing stiffer penalty on public servants and representatives as compared to others, and giving the corrupt smaller fish time to clean up their act. While sceptical of the potential of the move towards a less-cash economy in a country where only 53 per cent adults have bank accounts, Prof. Basu observed that “good or bad, that’s how the world will go”. Addressing the criticism about the government not tackling black money stashed in foreign accounts and real estate, he said the difficulty of corruption is that one can isolate the tumour in a surgery, but end up taking out some healthy tissue as well. He dismissed the claim of civil society critics that addressing corruption required determination alone. Arguing that corruption control is not entirely the domain of the government, he said history is replete with examples of poorly functioning businesses wherever people were corrupt in large numbers. Prof. Basu said corruption partly has to do with human mindsets. Sweden, for instance, moved from being an immensely corrupt society in the early 19th century to a clean one in a very short period of time. “What you believe as the norm matters a lot. If you believe everyone minds paying taxes, you will too.” The common thinking then locks in as the norm. An Australian study, which separated subjects into two groups of corruption-prone and non-corruption-prone people, found that the subjects mimicked the behavior of the group they were in.In India, Prof. Basu asserted, “We have to think in terms of changes of this kind.” He said managingcorruption is often looked upon as the job of the government machinery alone. But, as Scottish philosopher and economist David Hume asked, “Who polices the police?” Prof. Basu made the distinction between bribery and harassment bribery, where one is forced to bribe even for work you have legitimate right to get done, such as geting a driver’s licence. The Indian Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988, does not make this distinction. It makes the giver and taker of the bribe equally liable for the offence. Prof. Basu hence argued for making the liability of the taker to twice that of the giver to “rupture the joint interest”. He dismissed the government’s contention that demonetisation would flush out counterfeit currency as a non-argument. Contending that these notes won’t come into the system from terrorists, but from ordinary people, Prof. Basu said they will not get cleared out, but will get replaced. He argued in favour of a gradual withdrawal of high denomination currency notes as the economic jolt to be suffered for a “one-time cleaning up is disproportionate”. As for the government’s claim that demonetisation would control inflation, Prof. Basu said, “While black money is dreadful at the point of generation, it is no more inflationary than white money once it gets into the system.” The writer is a freelance journalist Printable version | Jan 7, 2017 1:42:49 AM | http://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/Demonetisation-may-lead-to-higher-drop-in-growth-next-year-fears-Basu/article16785933.ece © The Hindu SamBar, the new resto-bar that’s replaced Khar’s Loca Loca, has inventive cocktails and fun finger food inspired by the cuisine from south of the Vindhyas"

Does Section 26(2) of the RBI Act - under which the November 8 notification was issued - itself suffer from excessive delegation of powers and therefore ultravires the Constitution? 3. Whether the November 8 notification falls foul of Articles 14 and 19 of the Constitution? 4. Whether restriction on withdrawal of legitimate funds is violative of Article 14 and 19 of the Constitution? 5. Does the implementation of the November 8 notification suffer from procedural and substantive unreasonableness? 6. Whether November 8 notification and subsequent ones are in violation of Article 300A (right to property) of the Constitution? 7. Whether the exclusion of district central co-operative banks from exchange, deposit and withdrawal of money amounts to 'discrimination' against them? 8. What is the scope of judicial review in matters of fiscal/economic policy? 9. Can demonetisation only be brought in by a parliamentary statute? 10. Whether writ petitions filed by political parties under Article 32 of the Constitution are maintainable?

Ramagundam Commissioner of Police Vikram Jeet Duggal said at Kamanpur on Thursday that the gang was exchanging the new currency for a 30 per cent commission. The gang was caught red-handed and the cash recovered when the Kamanpur Sub-Inspector Madhusudhan and his team arrived at the Adivaraha Estate on getting the information about the whereabouts of gang members. The SI asked them to come to the place pretending to be an ordinary person looking for the exchange of old currency notes. The gang members sought Rs. 7.7 lakh in old currency notes for an exchange of Rs. 5.4 lakh of new notes. The arrested include Kalyanam Kiran Kumar, Moluguri Sagar, Kolipaka Dileep Kumar and Kanukurthi Karthik. Peddapalli DCP Vijayender Reddy, Godavarikhani Two Town Inspector Deva Reddy and others were also present.

976,2016-12-09,32.0,Demonetisation drive dampens Christmas article sale,"Thoothukudi: The sale of decorative materials such as stars, balloons, serial lights, Christmas trees and crib sets has not picked up this year, thanks to demonetisation of Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,000 currency notes, say many traders here. Normally, the sale for Christmas decorative items would commence on November 25 and pick up gradually. But now with only a fortnight left for Chirstmas, which marks the birth of Jesus Christ, very few people were visiting shops in the evening hours, S. Murugasekar, a trader on WGC Road, said. Just for buying Christmas materials for Rs. 150, the buyers were giving Rs. 2,000 notes. In order to satisfy the customers, the chosen items were given to them and they were asked to pay later. Even in most of the ATMs here, cash could not be withdrawn after 7 p.m. Mr. Murugasekar said mostly stars made of plastic were imported from China and paper material from Kollam in Kerala. Stars were sold at prices ranging from Rs. 5 to Rs. 800 and serial lights from Rs. 50 to Rs. 1,000. Christmas trees, some of which were priced at Rs. 10,000, were also available at Rs. 35. Crib sets, depicting the nativity scene of Jesus Christ, which were an integral part of the festival in most Christian houses, were available from Rs. 150 to Rs. 12,000. Since the lesser value articles were creating problems of giving the right change, the traders had been keeping their fingers crossed, he said. For M. Thangaraj, another trader doing business on VE Road here, the sale of Christmas decorative items was affected by not only demonetisation, but also suspension of fishing operations and the sudden demise of late Chief Minister Jayalalithaa. The local economy relied mainly on fishing, which remained suspended for days together, he said. M. Arulselvam, a trader, said Thoothukudi was hit by flash floods after consistent rains last year. Business was affected then, but not as severely as this time.

977,2016-12-09,32.0,Demonetisation: Venkaiah Naidu calls for debate on the issue,"Union Information and Broadcasting Minister M. Venkaiah Naidu
  Launching a counter attack on Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi for terming demonetisation as “foolish,” Union Information and Broadcasting Minister M. Venkaiah Naidu on Friday called for a countrywide debate on whether acting against black money and corruption was foolish or either keeping quiet or being a collaborator in the scams was foolish. “The country has to debate on this,” Mr. Naidu told a press conference here. Pointing out that the country witnessed a series of alleged scams including those related to 2-G spectrum allocation, coal and urea during the then UPA regime, he wondered if keeping quiet or being a collaborator in scam was a foolish act or acting against such scams was a foolish act? “I want to ask the Congress Party as well as Mr. Gandhi what is foolish? Is acting against drug mafia, black money, trafficking of women and children, hoarders foolish?” he remarked. If they were confident that whatever the government had done was foolish, why didn’t they debate the issue in Parliament and expose the government, he said. “Instead, you are indulging in contempt against people of the country and democracy,” he remarked, while expressing dissatisfaction over the Opposition parties stalling the Parliament session over demonetisation issue. He urged the Opposition to introspect and allow the Parliament to function. Ridiculing Mr. Gandhi for his claims that he would “expose everything” if allowed to speak in the Lok Sabha, Mr. Naidu remarked: “Rahul wants to debate before the media and in the market, but not in the Parliament.” He disapproved Mr. Gandhi’s allegations that the NDA government’s policies had claimed the lives of many farmers and said: “Let them state how many farmers died earlier in the Congress-ruled States of Karnataka and Maharashtra?” Mr. Naidu also termed Mr. Gandhi’s allegations of demonetisation resulting in lay-offs for many employees in private companies as “factually incorrect.” At the same time, he admitted that some people were facing inconvenience due to demonetisation. “These are the initial problems which would be overcome soon.” Answering a query, he said the incidents of money laundering in some States including Karnataka were a matter of concern. The Centre would act sternly against bank officials involved in these cases. Meanwhile, Mr. Naidu refused to make any comments on the prospects of BJP in Tamil Nadu politics saying that it was too early to take up such a discussion.

People from information technology (IT), pharmaceuticals, government employees and other corporates are the major customers and they transact up to 90 per cent through cheques and online transfers. Hence bringing transparency in these transactions. Since the Real Estate Regulation Act (RERA) was being set in place, the entire industry would be streamlined and the CREDAI wants all the builders - small and big - to be brought under the purview of the Act, making it a level-playing field, said Gummi Ram Reddy, CREDAI Telangana president. The demonetisation does not impact the apartments and construction sector in a major way. In fact, it was a boon for both the industry and the customers, where the rates of interest for housing loans were likely to come down after January, he added.

979,2016-12-09,32.0,"Post-demonetisation, farmers struggling to repay loans","While the government is trying to increase the area under paddy cultivation through new initiatives, for Kuttanad farmers its a tough way forward in the absence of any tangible help from the State administration. Most farmers are yet to get the price for the paddy procured by the Supplyco. The cash crunch triggered by the recent demonetisation of high-value currency notes has added to their woes, as they are unable to repay the loans that are due in November and December. Over 14,700 farmers in Alappuzha district had registered with Supplyco for the second paddy crop in 2015-16 under the government’s procurement scheme. A sum of Rs.13.97 crore has been disbursed so far and Rs.89.25 crore is still pending, the Supplyco paddy payment officer told The Hindu. A similar situation exists in other districts as well. Centre-State share The procurement price consists of the Central share of Rs.14.70 and the State share of Rs.7.80 per kg of paddy. The Central share till November 5 has been paid whereas the State share has not been paid at all for the second crop. “Many of the farmers are in distress as they have no money to take up farming operations,” says Kuttanad Vikasana Samithy Executive Director Thomas Peelianikkal. Operations for the next crop has already begun. “Farmers are at the receiving end of the monetary reforms ushered in by the Centre. Most of the farmers have taken agricultural loans at an interest rate of 4 per cent. They are not in a position to repay the loans that were due for repayment in November and December owing to non-availability of cash from banks,” Fr. Peelianikkal said. Penal interest “Non-repayment would be liable for penal interest and compound interest, which would come around 12 per cent. Penal action has been postponed in the aftermath of the currency demonetisation only in the case of loans with monthly instalments of repayment and not for the one-time annual repayment scheme to which most farmers in Kuttanad have subscribed,” he said. The farmers are in no position to avail themselves of gold loans as an emergency measure as there are restrictions on cash transactions. “The present loan repayment regime will affect the farmers badly as they could be liable for penal action for no fault of theirs,” Fr. Peelianikkal said. He demanded that the farmers be permitted to repay the loans without penalty till March 31, under the prevailing conditions. A petition in this connection has been forwarded to Union Finance Minister Arun Jaitley and a reply is being awaited.

980,2016-12-09,32.0,Will reveal everything about demonetisation ?scam?: Rahul Gandhi,"Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi  
| Photo Credit: Shanker Chakravarty As Parliament continued to remain gridlocked on the demonetisation issue, Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi on Friday promised an “earthquake” if he was permitted to speak in the Lok Sabha on what he described as the “biggest scam.” Mr. Gandhi said he would reveal in the House what was really behind the move to scrap high denomination notes. Speaking to journalists outside Parliament, Mr. Gandhi said his party wanted a debate on demonetisation so that the truth would come to the fore, but the government was running away from it. If he got a chance to speak on the issue in the House, he said “the Prime Minister will not be able to even sit there.” “The Prime Minister is giving speeches across the country but is afraid of coming to the Lok Sabha,” he continued, wondering what could be the reason for this “nervousness.” This challenge invited a sharp response from the government. Parliamentary Affairs Minister Ananth Kumar said a debate on demonetisation, under rule 193 (that doesn’t entail voting), had already been listed: Telangana Rashtra Samithi MP Jitendra Reddy had moved it, and Mr. Gandhi could have participated in that debate instead of asking for one under rule 184 (the latter involves voting), Mr. Kumar said. Crux of the dispute However, that has been the crux of the dispute between the government and the opposition — whether it should be a debate that entails voting or not. The Opposition has maintained all along that it cannot understand why the government is afraid to face a vote in the Lok Sabha, when it enjoys a majority there. The only reason, as Congress spokesperson Abhishek Singhvi suggested on Friday, was that the government was not sure of its allies’ position and was therefore “running scared.” Already, Uddhav Thackeray, whose Shiv Sena is part of the NDA, has made his displeasure on demonetisation clear to the government. His party has 18 MPs in the Lok Sabha. On Friday morning, Congress president Sonia Gandhi had met Lok Sabha Speaker Sumitra Mahajan on the issue but there were no signs of an end to the 16-day deadlock in Parliament. Shortly after the meeting, the Congress made it clear that there had been no toning down of its demand for having a discussion on demonetisation under the rule entailing voting in the Lok Sabha and ensuring the presence of the Prime Minister during the debate in the Rajya Sabha. Meanwhile, the government’s floor managers — stung by the criticism of its margdarshak L.K. Advani that they did not know how to run the House — used Mr. Gandhi’s remarks to train their guns on him. “If Rahul Gandhi thinks 9th December is the first day of Parliament, he is mistaken,” Mr. Kumar said. “A total of 19 sittings are over... We are asking the Congress, the TMC and the Left from November 16 to participate in a discussion on demonetisation.. They have not shown any inclination to do that.” “Suddenly, today Rahul Gandhi came prepared. When they come prepared, they feel that all the business of the House be suspended forthwith and he should address. That doesn't happen. That is the way Congress can run, but not Parliament of India,” he added. The Minister claiming that a debate under a rule that entails voting and one that does not is not substantively different, said, “Once again I appeal, rather than raising bogeys, changing goalposts and exclamation of bravado like earthquake, holding earth shattering revelation for so long is not good.” Printable version | Jan 7, 2017 1:43:02 AM | http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/Will-reveal-everything-about-demonetisation-%E2%80%98scam%E2%80%99-Rahul-Gandhi/article16784348.ece © The Hindu Be it nature’s fury or man’s folly, destructions are alike.

982,2016-12-09,32.0,How Modi and team kept demonetisation a closely guarded secret,"Prime Minister Narendra Modi hand-picked a trusted bureaucrat, little known outside India's financial circles, to spearhead a radical move to abolish 86 per cent of the country's cash overnight and take aim at the huge shadow economy. Hasmukh Adhia, the bureaucrat, and five others privy to the plan were sworn to utmost secrecy, say sources with knowledge of the matter. They were supported by a young team of researchers working in two rooms at Modi's New Delhi residence, as he plotted his boldest reform since coming to power in 2014. When announced, the abolition of old notes of Rs. 500 and Rs.1,000 came as a bolt from the blue. The secrecy was aimed at outflanking those who might profit from prior knowledge, by pouring cash into gold, property and other assets and hide illicit wealth. A risky plan Previously unreported details of Mr. Modi's handling of the so-called “demonetisation” open a window onto the hands-on role he played in implementing a key policy, and how he was willing to act quickly even when the risks were high. While some advocates say the scrapping of the banknotes will bring more money into the banking system and raise tax revenues, millions of Indians are furious at having to queue for hours outside banks to exchange or deposit their old money. Labourers have also been unpaid and produce has rotted in markets as cash stopped changing hands. Not enough replacement notes were printed in preparation for the upheaval, and it could take months for things to return to normal. The Uttar Pradesh election coming up in early 2017 could decide Modi's chances of a second term in office, there is little time for the hoped-for benefits of his cash swap to outweigh short-term pain. Mr. Modi has staked his reputation and popularity on the move. “I have done all the research and, if it fails, then I am to blame,” he told a Cabinet meeting on November 8 shortly before the move was announced, according to three ministers who attended. A direct line to Modi Overseeing the campaign, with support from the back room team camped out at Mr. Modi's sprawling bungalow, was Mr. Adhia, a top Finance Ministry official. The 58-year-old served as principal secretary to Mr. Modi from 2003-06 when he was Gujarat Chief Minister, establishing a relationship of trust with his boss and introducing him to yoga. Colleagues interviewed by Reuters said he had a reputation for integrity and discretion. Mr. Adhia was named revenue secretary in September 2015, reporting formally to Finance Minister Arun Jaitley. In reality, he had a direct line to Mr. Modi and they would speak in their native Gujarati when they met to discuss issues in depth. “Biggest, boldest step” Immediately after the address, Mr. Adhia tweeted: “This is the biggest and the boldest step by the Government for containing black money.” The boast harked back to Mr. Modi's election vow to recover black money from abroad that had resonated with voters fed up with the corruption scandals that plagued the last Congress government. Yet in office, he struggled to keep his promise. Over more than a year, Mr. Modi commissioned research from officials at the Finance Ministry, the central bank and think-tanks on how to advance his fight against black money, a close aide said. He demanded answers to questions such as: How quickly India could print new banknotes; how to distribute them; would state banks benefit if they received a rush of new deposits; and who would gain from demonetisation? The topics were broken up to prevent anyone from joining the dots and concluding that a cash swap was in the offing. “We didn't want to let the cat out of the bag,” said a senior official directly involved. “Had people got a whiff of the decision, the whole exercise would have been meaningless.” Under Mr. Adhia's oversight, the team of researchers assembled and modeled the findings in what was, for it, a theoretical exercise. It was made up of young experts in data and financial analysis; some ran Mr. Modi's social media accounts and a smartphone app that he used to solicit public feedback. Yet for all the planning, Mr. Modi and Mr. Adhia knew they could not foresee every eventuality, and were willing to move swiftly. The announcement caused chaos, with huge queues forming at banks when they reopened after a short holiday. New Rs. 2,000 rupee notes were hard to come by and barely any new Rs. 500 notes were printed. India's 200,000 cash dispensers could not handle the new, smaller, notes and it would take weeks to reconfigure them. Filling ATMs with the Rs. 8 trillion in new banknotes that the Finance Ministry reckons are needed to restore liquidity to the economy is even trickier. In a best-case scenario, in which India's four banknote presses churned out new Rs.500 and Rs.2,000 notes designed to replace the abolished ones, it would take at least three months to hit that target. Secrecy paramount Secrecy was paramount, but clues had been left. Back in April, analysts at State Bank of India said that demonetisation of large-denomination notes was possible. The Reserve Bank of India also disclosed in May that it was making preparations for a new series of banknotes that were confirmed in August when it announced it had approved a design for a new Rs. 2000 note. The printing presses had only just started turning when the media finally started to run with the story in late October. “The plan was to introduce it around November 18, but there was a clear sign that it could get leaked,” said one person with direct knowledge who, like others interviewed by Reuters, asked not to be named due to the sensitivity of the matter. Some officials in the Finance Ministry had expressed doubts about scrapping high-value notes when the idea came up for discussion. They now feel resentment at the secrecy in which Mr. Adhia rammed through the plan on Mr. Modi's orders. They also say the plan was flawed because of a failure to ramp up printing of new notes ahead of time. Other critics say the Adhia team fell prey to a form of ""group think” that ignored outside advice. In the words of one former top official who has worked at the Finance Ministry and central bank: “They don't know what's happening in the real world.” Printable version | Jan 7, 2017 1:43:06 AM | http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/How-Modi-and-team-kept-demonetisation-a-closely-guarded-secret/article16782821.ece © The Hindu Be it nature’s fury or man’s folly, destructions are alike.

seen from Saudi Arabia, Turkey and Brazil. Photo: REUTERS
  India’s export and import (EXIM) containerised trade reported 10 per cent growth in the July-September quarter (Q3) as compared with one per cent growth in the same period last year due to improvement in the economies of key export markets and growing demand for imported products in the domestic market, said Maersk Line, in its Q3 trade report titled “India, solid economic growth.” The containerised trade accounted for approximately 55 per cent of the country’s total EXIM trade volumes. While exports to the U.S. and Europe remained steady, an increased demand from Latin America, Far East and South Africa contributed to the overall export growth of 9 per cent. “India continues to shine in the global trade growth. This is driven by stability in the U.S. market, ongoing improvement in the European economy and growth in emerging markets such as Latin America with exports to Brazil nearly doubling this quarter as compared to the same quarter last year,” said Franck Dedenis, Managing Director, India, Sri Lanka and Bangladesh Cluster, Maersk Line. North India led the country’s global trade witnessing a 22 per cent increase in exports and a 26 per cent increase in imports. Exports The U.S. and Europe have traditionally been the regions accounting for the largest piece of India’s exports. However, increased demand has been seen from Saudi Arabia, Turkey and Brazil. Automobiles, Garments and Metals contributed to exports growth. Strong volume growth in the automobile sector was driven by demand from Egypt, South Africa, Algeria and Brazil and the U.S. Garment and metal volume growth was driven by U.S. and Europe. Exports of frozen and cut vegetables and an increased demand from the Middle East contributed to growth in agri exports. Fish exports moved up due to a strong shrimp season in East and South India. China dominated the import market led by consumer electronics and solar panels. Imports from North America rose by 21 per cent due to price competitiveness it offered in commodities such as textiles, apparels, accessories, plastics and rubber. Import of fruits and nuts nearly doubled due to strong domestic demand. Currency effect Trade-wise, Maersk Line expected India’s EXIM growth in the fourth quarter to be slower than in the third, as a result of the demonetisation exercise undertaken by the Government in November this year. “Limited availability of new currency in the hands of people will impact exports in sectors like agriculture due to a high number of cash transactions. We have seen transactions declining in November,” said Mr. Dedenis. The reduction in consumption of imported goods, especially garments, will hit imports hard in the January-March quarter as importers will reduce their orders in the current quarter.

cent at 15.63 lakh units in November. Photo: REUTERS
  The cash crunch following demonetisation of old Rs.500 and Rs.1,000 notes has hit the auto sector, with sales in November being impacted across all segments. While passenger vehicle sales in the country grew by 1.82 per cent in November, the lowest rate since February this year, sales of two-wheelers fell by almost 6 per cent, and commercial vehicle sales were down close to 12 per cent, as per the data released by Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers (SIAM), on Thursday. The total vehicle sales across categories has seen a decline of 5.48 per cent at 15.63 lakh units during the month. It is the steepest decline in 43 months. “In November, companies were able to push stock to dealers as the inventory levels were down owing to a good festive season in October. So, the impact is not visible at wholesale levels. It will be only clear after this month after taking into account retail sales,” SIAM Director General Vishnu Mathur said. ‘Temporary phenomenon’ Asked if the industry body would revise its growth estimates for the year, Mr. Mathur said, “There is no slowdown. This is a temporary phenomenon. People are just postponing purchases due to shortage of cash…We expect things to normalise January onwards, if things settle down.” More than 80 per cent of the cost of passenger vehicles is financed. “So, the impact is more prominent in rural areas where cash buys are more,” Mr. Mathur said. Hence, two-wheeler sales present the correct picture of the current situation. He added that car companies had seen a decline in footfalls at showrooms in the first week after demonetisation, but they recovered in the weeks that followed. Flat growth Passenger vehicle (includes cars and utility vehicles) sales in November stood at more than 2.40 lakh units, compared to more than 2.36 lakh in the same period last year. While sales of cars remained almost flat at more than 1.73 lakh units, utility vehicles grew at the slowest pace in the past 10 months of 10 per cent to 53,800 units. Commercial vehicle sales stood at 45,773 units, down from 51,766 units in November 2015. Total two-wheeler sales in November clocked more than 12.43 lakh units compared with more than 13.20 lakh units in the same month last year. While motorcycle sales declined by 10.21 per cent to about 7.78 lakh units, scooter sales were down 1.85 per cent to more than 3.88 lakh units. ‘Significant impact’ Sridhar V, Partner, Grant Thornton India commented, “Demonetisation has had a significant impact in the November sales across all segments of vehicles. But is that the bottom, one can’t say; the performance over the next couple of months would reveal the actual impact. The expected rate cut also did not happen and could prolong the pain for the short-term.” In the April-November period, however, total vehicle sales across categories grew 12.5 per cent to 1.54 crore units as against 1.37 crore in the same period last year.

985,2016-12-09,32.0,"Post-demonetisation, use of digital wallets, apps goes up","Even after 30 days of demonetisation, Tamil Nadu continues to face a cash crunch with banks and ATMS still running dry and only Rs. 2000 notes available. On the other hand, firms offering digital payments have seen interesting trends on how people utilised them to tide over the crisis. On November 8, Prime Minister Narendra Modi had announced the biggest-ever demonetisation exercise in India by withdrawing Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,000 notes as legal tender. “For Paytm, Chennai was the seventh big city in terms of transactions. With demonetisation, we have seen a definite increase in transactions and it will become the fifth top city in terms of usage,” Deepak Abbot, Senior Vice President, Paytm, said. He also pointed out prior to the demonetisation drive, out of 100 people only 50 were active users from Tamil Nadu. “Now we are seeing 100 per cent active users, when compared to other States where the adoption is quite slow.” Interestingly, Paytm is seeing its wallet being used mostly in petrol pumps in Tamil Nadu. “That was a surprise, given the fact that petrol pumps were allowed to accept the old Rs. 500 and Rs.1,000 notes till December 2. This might be because petrol pumps were not able to tender change,” Mr. Abbot said. The other key use cases for Paytm were for buying medicines and paying for local transportation. A cement dealer said the firms extended credit to facilitate retail sales and this was done to customers with good credit profile and who had long-term relationship. He also said most dealers had shifted to digital payment modes. Chennai-based BeWo Technologies, which provides a point of sale device to kirana stores for billing, is extending the device to offer digital payment options. “Currently, the system comes with an integrated printer, barcode scanner, 3G, UPS and comprehensive PoS application including billing, inventory and promotions. We are extending it to digital payments and are in talks with mobile wallets and banks,” said R Sampath, MD and CEO of BeWo. Chennai-based Planhound, whose app allows users to track their mobile usage and choose an appropriate plan, has seen on average 70 per cent increase in transactions post the demonetisation drive. “We have enabled more digital payment options and also run attractive cash back coupon schemes, which enabled us to see increased number of transactions,” its co-founder Ankit Chhajer said.

| Photo Credit: BASHEER SRIKAKULAM: Hundreds of construction workers have lost their livelihood for the last one month, with the impact of demonetisation of Rs.1,000 and Rs. 500 notes. All the builders in Srikakulam and Vizianagaram have stopped the construction activity with the cash crunch. With non-availability of works in and around the two district headquarters, workers are struggling to make their ends meet. One can find huge gathering of workers at places like the Potti Sriramulu junction and the Day and Night junction, 7 Roads and other places of Srikakulam, searching for work. No work Each worker used to earn around Rs. 250 per day and woman worker was assured of earning around Rs.175. “After the steep hike in material cost, the builders have already stopped construction of new apartments. Demonetisation is another big blow. So, hardly we have been getting any work for the last one week. I can’t get work in Vizag and other places, since similar conditions are prevailing there,” said B. Ramu Naidu, a worker of Sri Kurmam. Lakshmi said the slowdown in the construction activity had left them helpless and many labourers were already in debt trap. “The government’s war against black money is good for society. But it should think of the life of labourers too,” she added. Some of the builders provided soft loans to senior and regular workers. The workers are facing troubles in getting and exchanging money as the government has further slashed the payment of Rs.2,000. Some of the banks said the payments would be made only through accounts. However, the majority of the workers had accounts in their villages and mandals, but they could not travel all the way to their native places. “We used to go to cities whenever there was slump in construction activity in Srikaulam and Vizianagaram. But the situation is similar in cities like Visakhapatnam and Vijayawada,” adds another worker.

PTI Manipur, which has been struggling to cope with an indefinite ‘economic blockade’ since November 1, now faces a siege-like situation following a wildcat ‘total shutdown’ imposed by the United Naga Council (UNC) and other Naga organisations since November 25. The latest shutdown follows the arrest of UNC president Gaidon Kamei and information secretary Stephen Lamkang, who have been remanded in custody till December 22. Faced with demands for their release for a lifting of the blockade, Chief Minister Okram Ibobi Singh, however, told The Hindu, “The law will take its own course.” The blockade has emptied the State’s markets of essential supplies. With nothing to buy, demonetisation has, ironically, left the people indifferent. Since November 1, there has been no normal movement of trucks on National Highways 2 and 37 — lifelines that pass through Naga villages — or along the 100-km Imphal-Moreh Road on the Trans Asian Highway No 1. The UNC, which claims to represent Naga interests, is opposed to the creation of the Sadar Hills district out of the Senapati district, with a substantial Naga population. At midnight on Thursday, the State Cabinet finalised the creation of seven new districts, with the nomenclature of Sadar Hills changed to Kangpokpi. Mr. Ibobi says this has been done for administrative convenience, and that to create a district is the prerogative of the government. However, Naga organisations, who met to take stock of the development, have said, “It amounts to rubbing salt in the wounds.” The creation of new districts has been a subject of ethnic strife in Manipur since 1971, when it was first proposed. Successive governments have failed to resolve the festering identity-driven tensions sparked by the exercise. For instance, Naga and Kuki villages are located side by side in all four hill districts of Manipur. Mr. Ibobi Singh, who has helmed Manipur’s successive Congress-led governments since March 2002, told The Hindu: “The UNC does not respond to our invitations to hold talks on the stand-off and other issues. So we requested Home Minister Rajnath Singh to resolve the crisis by convening a tripartite meeting.” However, the State government at the last moment backed out of a meeting between the Government of India, the Manipur government and the UNC on November 15. Home Ministry officials met representatives of the UNC as planned but failed to break the impasse. Whereas amity is widely prevalent in people-to-people interactions, the ongoing stalemate between the State government and Naga hardliners has slowed normal life to a halt in Manipur. Essential commodities like potatoes, eggs, lentils, edible oil and salt have vanished from the markets; life-saving drugs are scarce, and fuel is being strictly rationed. Ruling on a public interest litigation (PIL) petition, the High Court of Manipur on November 25 directed the State government to provide adequate security to vehicles plying along the two national highways. Two other directives call for the deployment of paramilitary forces to ensure the free movement of the trucks. Cross-border trade with Myanmar at border towns of Moreh in Manipur and Namphalong in Myanmar, legalised since 1995, has also come to a standstill,hit by the double whammy of the blockade and demonetisation. Although the formal trade agreement identifies only some items, all manner of goods make their way to Manipur from here. The blockade has driven down the rupee-kyat exchange rate at these markets from 1,900 kyat/Rs. 100 to 800 kyat/Rs.100. Transportation of goods from other States to Manipur has also been affected. The All Naga Students’ Association Manipur told reporters that it had no objection to the creation of the new district, provided the Nagas were consulted on the process.

990,2016-12-10,33.0,"Bidri artisans hit by demonetisation, sale of wares sees huge dip","Bidri artisans are suffering from an acute shortage of cash following demonetisation. Withdrawal of high value notes and the resultant cash crunch has reduced the sale of Bidriware. Bidriware is made using copper, zinc and silver. Demonetisation has pushed up the prices of copper and silver. Artisans have been forced to spend more on silver and copper, even as sales of artefacts are falling. “We hear stories of people rushing to buy gold. But I do not understand why price of silver has gone up,’’ wonders Abdul Bari, a third generation artisan. For the artisans, almost all transactions are cash-based. “I don’t recall any artisan who accepts cards in his shop,” says Rashid Ahmed Quadri, a national award winning artisan. I have been making and selling Bidriware for nearly 40 years now, but I have never seen such a sudden drop in sales, he said. A lot of Bidriware is sold online. But the participation of local artisans in that trade is negligible, says S. Shafi Ahmed, founder of Black Gold, a federation of Bidri artisans. Only a handful of young people, who are sons of artisans, have begun learning to sell online. The rest are still selling them in brick and mortar stores. Such people are badly hit, he said. Of the 52 families involved in the traditional handicraft, only a few have bank accounts or ATM cards. Assistant artisan Ashok Ram has neither. We are used to getting paid every week. “The craftsmen pay workers like us only if his wares sell. They are putting off payments saying sales are less. Some people are saying this suffering is temporary. What do they know of our problems,” he said. Not very different is the story of Kinnal artistes in Koppal district, who say their livelihood has been affected. The move is slowly robbing us of our livelihoods, says Ajay Chitragar. Every week we collect money from the traders, middlemen or societies. Traders are either asking us to wait for one month to receive payments or giving us less than the market price. That money flow has almost stopped now. Very few artisans sell their ware directly to consumers and even they are suffering as few people are buying. Only a few artisans depend on banks. My family has two bank accounts, but we don’t usually use ATM cards. The first week after demonetization was very bad because we had to spend hours before banks to deposit or exchange old notes. We had to go to the lone bank branch in Kinnal village and stand from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. Even then, there was no guarantee of getting the money, he said. Even today, at least one member of the family is forced to wait in queues while the others keep working, he said. An average artisan makes around Rs. 5,000 per week. A large part of it is spent on buying wood, paint or tools. While Atti (ficus) wood is bought once a year and stocked in each artisan’s house, small pieces of teak and other coloured wood are bought weekly or monthly. A few of us have been able to buy high value wood this month, the craftsman said. Though the government says you can withdraw Rs. 25,000 per week, the bank staff say they don’t have much cash and they need to ration it out to all those who seek. This is adding to our problems, he said. Kinnal artisans are mostly from Dalit families and usually don’t own lands. Of the 75 families, only a dozen families are in handicrafts making. The rest of them work as construction labourers or farm hands, says Mr. Chitragar. He also revealed that artisans had fought out temptations to receive large amounts of cash by some rich people who wanted to deposit it in their accounts. We were not sure if that was valid. We were also afraid we may lose benefits extended to poor families, Mr. Chitragar said.

Sudheer Babu, an Indian Postal Service officer of 2011 batch, has been arrested late on Thursday night. The CBI said, in a press release, that Mr. Sudheer Babu, working as Senior Superintendent of Post offices (SSPO), Hyderabad City Division, has abused his official position and dishonestly and fraudulently misappropriated funds, which were under his custody meant for distribution to various post offices in the city for being exchanged with the old notes available with the common people. Mr. Sudheer Babu clandestinely misappropriated funds to the tune of Rs. 2.95 crore and exchanged these notes with old currency notes with private parties by taking commission. In the process, records had been manipulated to show as if these amounts were exchanged in the routine course. During interrogation, his links with two agents/middlemen T. Nitin and V. Narasimha Reddy who actively assisted Mr. Sudheer Babu in committing the fraud by receiving part of commission came to light. The two had been arrested and the three were being produced before the special judge for CBI cases here on Friday. The development follows three cases registered by the CBI, ACB in connection with the currency exchange fraud detected at Himayatnagar, Golkonda and Karwan Sahu sub-post offices. An amount of Rs. 17.02 lakh of new currency notes had been recovered. Seven persons had been arrested so far and the police seized 55 incriminating documents, few laptops and mobile phones during the searches conducted at 11 places in the city. Further investigation into the case was underway, the release said.

992,2016-12-10,33.0,Demonetisation: Parents feel the pinch as school admission season begins,"The cash crunch that people are facing as an aftermath of the demonetisation of Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,000 notes is hitting a process that has begun months ahead of schedule: school admissions. Several parents are scrambling to mobilise cash to pay for their child’s tuition fee. While it is a common practice for several schools to take a part of the payment in cash and not provide receipts for it, many parents say that with the current cash shortage they are dealing with, it may be tough for them to pay the “donation” fees. A parent who was scouting for a school in north Bengaluru for admitting his son to kindergarten said one school has asked him to pay Rs. 60,000 through a cheque or demand draft in the name of the school, while the remaining Rs. 40,000 had to be paid towards building fee for which no receipt would be given. “It is difficult to withdraw such a huge amount after demonetisation. But the school management is refusing to budge as they say that we have to comply with this if we want a seat,” he said. “There needs to be a mechanism to complain against school managements that do not accept cheque or DD. It is a nightmare for parents to mobilise funds, particularly after demonetisation,” a parent who is scouting for a seat for her daughter for class one in Jalahalli said. Mullahalli Suri, president of the Parents’ Association, said they had filed a complaint with the Education Department to crackdown on the donation menace. “Several parents have brought it to our notice that school managements are pressurising them to pay in cash, but none of them is willing to come forward to lodge a complaint with the Education Department,” he said. However, Mr. Suri was optimistic and hoped that demonetisation would bring down the capitation fee and donations. D. Shashi Kumar, general secretary, Associated Managements of Primary and Secondary Schools in Karnataka, said following demonetisation, many State board schools were unable to pay salaries to their teaching and non-teaching staff as the revenue of the schools is dependent on monthly tuition fees. “Most State board schools collect monthly tuition fee, ranging between Rs. 5,000 and Rs. 2,000, apart from an annual admission fee ranging from Rs. 5,000 to Rs. 1,000. With fee collection being hit, sports and cultural programmes have been deferred,” he said.

The “advisory”, a copy of which was purportedly published on the ICAI’s website, invoked “the spirit of the ICAI — partner in nation building” to ask all its members “to be more cautious and careful while advising their clients, sharing or writing their views on any platform regarding demonetisation and work towards the best interest of the nation”.

It was clarified that the said audio clip was a fake one and the voice therein was not of Mr. Reddy. “It is emphatically stated that the audio clip is fake and put in circulation to malign the image of the institute. The views expressed in the said audio clip do not represent the views of Reddy or the Council of ICAI,” the institute added.

994,2016-12-11,34.0,Reading demonetisation at a book exhibition,"No buyers: Booksellers, publishers and stall owners at the book fair at Bangur in North 24 Parganas are failing to recover the cost. — Photo: Special Arrangement
  After walking half a kilometre, past 50 stalls with makeshift wooden racks, not even one person buying a book could be sighted. Most of the visitors gathered in front of a giant stage on the other side of the sprawling premises, watching a local version of Dance India Dance. In this book fair at Bangur in North 24-Parganas, one of the many held in the run-up to the Kolkata International Book Fair in January, such dance numbers were drawing more crowds than the book stalls. Time running out At the centre of the fair, sitting in one of the stalls, a middle-aged man was looking at his watch. Chandan Kumar Dutta, manager of Naya Udyog, a Kolkata-based publisher, said that till 7 p.m. on Friday, they sold just one book — at Rs. 145. “In 2014, we sold nearly 5,000 a day,” he said. Other publishers said that Mr. Dutta was “lucky” to have sold one this time. This unorganised sector employs about 1.5 million people directly in Bengal, according to Publishers and Booksellers Guild, which organises such book fairs in Kolkata and the districts. Fairs start at the beginning of December and continue through the winter. But the booksellers, publishers and stall owners are failing to recover the cost, said Tridib Chatterjee, the general secretary of the guild. “When we sent the form of intent [for Kolkata Fair] in September, there was a huge response as during every year. But it was much before the demonetisation,” said Mr. Chatterjee, who owns one of the robust publishing houses on College Street, the book hub of Bengal. In all, 700 publishers participated in last year’s Kolkata International Book Fair, while around 1,500 applied this year. “But till they return the forms and confirm participation … we may not know how many [publishers] will participate,” said Mr. Chatterjee. If the fair is stopped, then it would be for the first time in its 40-year-old history that it will be halted. “It may not be halted, but we cannot guess the size and turnover,” Mr. Chatterjee said. ‘Multiple’ interests For big and small publishers and booksellers, the Kolkata fair is somewhat like what the Academy Awards are for the actors. The chief of one of the top-end bookstores of Kolkata said, on condition of anonymity, that book traders associated with the fair for “multiple” business interests. “For a big seller it is more of promoting the brand, while for the top- and low-end Bengali publishers, the Kolkata fair is about sales through counter. They sell nearly as much of what they sell throughout the year,” he said. Perhaps, a good reason for smaller publishers such as Setu to put up a stall in the Kolkata fair. “It is about selling our brand and books, both, in the Kolkata fair and thus we will participate, even if we are gasping now,” Subrata Das, owner of Setu, said. Mr. Das said nearly all payments were made in cash by the small publishers, creating the problem. “We receive cash from the booksellers and pay the printer, proofreader, binder or even writers in cash,” he said. The unavailability of cash crippled the industry. Mr. Chatterjee said that his counter sales dropped from “five to six lakh a month to a mere 60,000” last month. “Can’t blame the readers as they need to buy daily consumables before they buy books,” said Subhankar Dey of Dey’s Publishing, another top-end publishing house of College Street.

995,2016-12-11,34.0,Currency crunch hits cattle shandy,"No takers: Horses and carts waiting to be purchased at the cattle shandy organised on the occasion of Karthigai Deepam at Tiruvannamalai on Sunday.  
| Photo Credit:  ; - C_VENKATACHALAPATHY Twenty three people from Kallampuli village in Kadaiyanallur taluk of Tirunelveli district have come to Tiruvannamalai Karthigai Deepam Cattle Shandy to purchase a set of bullocks for their village temple. Asked why they came all the way from Kadaiyanallur, travelling 470 km to buy a pair of bullocks, Ramar, one of the villagers, said: “We want to buy it from Tiruvannamalai Deepam, a sacred festival in a sacred place. Although we purchase the cattle a day earlier, we won’t untie the cattle until we have a glimpse of the Mahadeepam.” Diraviyam, another person from the team, said: “We want to buy ‘Ottan Kalai’ that is more powerful than others. This breed is not available in our place. That is also one reason why we come this far.” He was referring to a breed called ‘Merkathi’ or ‘Osur’ in the local parlance. The shandy used to be famous for native breeds such as this. Despite the sentiment and breed-specific significance attached to this shandy, business was poor this year. “Only about 40 to 50 per cent of heads of cattle came this year,” said Palani, a cattle trader from Arani who has been in the business for the last 40 years. “Neither traders don’t have money to buy nor do our customers have money to buy from us. I myself purchased 13 bullocks from Andhra Pradesh to sell them in this shandy. Because of the goodwill I enjoy, considering the money crisis they sold them on credit to me. Every trader cannot get credit,” Mr. Palani added. “Not only the number of heads of cattle, but species specific slump is also palpable here. ‘Osur’ and ‘Tiruvannamalai’ breeds have arrived in very low numbers. Because of depletion of local breeds, their prices go up,” says Kasi Vembaiyan, a writer and former agricultural journalist. Even the low number of heads of cattle have very few takers. The sellers are even prepared to accept old notes of Rs. 500 or Rs. 1,000 for a portion of the price. “But still there are very few takers,” said a seller. Apart from directly affecting the purchasing power of farmers, the demonetisation has hit the shandy in many ways. “No rains. Even the farmers who want to take up farming despite lack of water could not do so because they could not buy inputs for the cultivation and pay wages because of demonetisation. When there is no farming who will come to buy cattle, other than a few men looking for carts,” asks Murugan, a seller. Although there is no palpable slump in the number of horses that came for sales, only very few are sold. Siva, a jockey from Tiruvannamalai, said on Sunday: “As far as I know, only four horses were sold from yesterday”. Several allied trades like horse hair pruning, bull horn sharpening, shops that sell ornaments, and accessories for cattle were dull.

997,2016-12-11,34.0,Demonetisation: RBI Act to be amended,"  The government is likely to amend the Reserve Bank of India Act to extinguish the validity of Rs. 500 and Rs. 1000 printed before November 9 and a reference to this effect would be made in the upcoming Budget. As part of the demonetisation process, there would be a law to make Rs. 500/1000 notes invalid and it can be made effective from March 31, sources said. “In 1978, when the currency was banned, the law to annul the validity came ahead. This time the government acted under 26 (2),” sources said. As per RBI Act Section 26 (2), the central government, on the recommendation of the Central Board of RBI, may by notification in the Gazette of India, declare that, with effect from such date as may be specified in the notification, any series of bank notes of any denomination shall cease to be legal tender. Asked about the amount of money which did not get into the system, sources said, it would add to the bottom line of the RBI and it would be in a position to pay the government in the form of higher dividend or special dividend. Banks have received Rs. 12 lakh crore demonetised currency notes as against Rs. 15.5 lakh crore. The government expects Rs. 13 lakh crore to come back to banking system. Higher dividend from the RBI due to cancellation of Rs. 500/1000 may not be applicable until the RBI law is amended. Last week, Reserve Bank Governor Urjit Patel said it would not have any automatic impact on the central bank’s balance sheet as per the existing law. “Actually, the withdrawal of legal tender characteristics status does not extinguish any of RBI’s balance sheet. Therefore, there is no implication on the balance sheet as of now. The question of a special dividend automatically does not arise as of now,” Mr. Patel had said. RBI has issued currency notes worth over Rs. 4.27 lakh crore to public through banks and ATMs following the demonetisation of old high value bills.

998,2016-12-11,34.0,Demonetisation hits TDP?s membership drive,"RAJAMAHENDRAVARAM: Demonetisation has dealt a blow to the ruling Telugu Desam Party (TDP)’s membership drive too at many places in the State. While Kadapa tops the State with 106 per cent enrolments, it is followed by Anantapur with 99.65 per cent and Chittoor 94 per cent. Visakhapatnam with 57 per cent enrolments and Vizianagaram with 66 p.c. stood last till Friday evening. The TDP started its membership drive on November 1 and just after a week the Modi government announced the demonetisation on November 8. TDP president and Chief Minister N. Chandrababu Naidu welcomed the decision and also exhorted the cadre to lead the cashless transactions drive, but, when it came to his party’s membership drive, it became a stumbling block. Seethamsetty Venkateswara Rao, former MLA and TDP senior leader from Rampachodavaram, said that getting change for Rs.2,000 note had been a big problem for the last one month, which had badly hit the membership drive. The enrolments dropped drastically compared with the numbers achieved last year. “My target is to bring in 16,000 members in seven mandals. However, I am not sure if I will be able to achieve at least 25 per cent before November 30, the deadline,” said Mr. Venkateswara Rao. As most of the tribal people were coming with Rs.2,000 notes to pay the Rs.100 membership fee, it was next to impossible to return them hundred rupee notes for Rs. 1900, he lamented. Adding to their woes, he said, cultivation works were in full swing in Rampachodavaram Agency and no tribal was showing interest in participating in the membership drive. Vizag in last place On the other hand, in East Godavari district, Rajamahendravaram, Kakinada and Kakinada rural mandals are lagging behind in achieving the membership targets. According to party State organising secretary Ganni Krishna, the membership drive was going on at a snail’s pace in urban areas as party workers were getting only Rs.2,000 notes from the ATMs. Visakhapatnam urban mandal, for which he is the party in charge, is almost in the last place. In contrast, change problem was less in rural areas as workers were coming with Rs.100, 50 or 20 notes to pay the membership fee, he added. The membership drive was already extended by the party once till December 15 in view of the demonetisation and it is likely to be extended one more time as even 50 per cent of the target has not been achieved in most of the districts.

999,2016-12-11,34.0,Dinesh calls demonetisation a conspiracy hatched by BJP leaders,"Terming the deomonetisation initiative by Prime Minister Narendra Modi as the biggest failure, working president of the Karnataka Pradesh Congress Committee (KPCC) Dinesh Gundurao alleged here on Saturday that the talk of “cashless economy” was a ploy to hide the failure. Addressing presspersons here on Saturday, Mr. Dinesh Gundurao said that demonetisation was the biggest conspiracy hatched by the BJP leaders led by Mr. Modi and it was slowly coming to light. “The Prime Minister has been inconsistent in his statements. First he termed it as a fight against black money and then against terrorists. And now he is speaking of a cashless society,” he said. He said that already reports about BJP units purchasing land a few days before the demonetisation announcement was made has come to light. “There has been a sudden increase in the quantum of deposits made in the banks in September. There are also reports about BJP leaders being caught with huge quantity of new currency. The former Prime Minister, Manmohan Singh, has said that the GDP will fall by 2 per cent as crores of people have lost their jobs. It is a bogus scheme of helping the rich and inflicting pain on the commoners,” he said. Mr. Gundurao said that agencies like RBI, ED and CBI had become rubber stamps of Mr. Modi and the PM was reluctant to give an answer in the Parliament. Mr. Modi, who spoke of bringing black money stashed in Swiss banks, has done nothing in this regard, he said. Instead, he has made the people suffer and helped the rich through demonetisation, he said. Congress Walk Mr Gundurao said that the party had already launched “Congress Nadige Surajyada Kadege (Congress walk towards good prosperous state) with the objective of sensitising the people on what the party had done for the benefit of the people and the workers would conduct campaigns in all assembly segments in the state by January end. He said the party would face the next assembly election under the leadership of Mr Siddaramaiah. To a query he clarified that inactive units of the party at taluk and block levels would be restructured. Earlier he chaired a meeting of the Hubballi-Dharwad district unit of the party.

1000,2016-12-11,34.0,Congress reiterates demand for JPC probe into demonetisation,"Reiterating the demand for a joint parliamentary committee (JPC) probe into demonetisation, the All India Congress Committee (AICC) spokesperson P.C. Chacko said here on Saturday that the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Finance has summoned RBI Governor Urjit Patel to appear before it on Tuesday next. It was to explain on demonetisation, he told presspersons here, alleging that the government has demonetised the notes of Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,000 denominations without the knowledge of the standing committee headed by M. Veerappa Moily. The AICC continued to allege that demonetisation was the “worst scam” that Independent India had ever seen and it was not an economic reform. Calling it a “financial anarchy,” Mr. Chacko said that the Congress will continue its campaign and press for a JPC probe. Mr. Chacko alleged that Prime Minister Narendra Modi made people to believe that the decision on going for demonetisation was highly confidential, but in reality it was not. The BJP was aware of it and the party purchased land worth Rs. 100 crores in various districts for its district committee offices before the announcement of demonetisation. Thus it had invested black money in real estate, he added. “It was a deep secret conspiracy,” he alleged. The AICC alleged that the demonetisation was haphazardly planned and it had hit the public, especially in the informal sector, hard. “The government has changed the rules and objectives of demonetisation 18 times in the first nine days and the rules are changing every day that the public is totally confused,” he said. Mr. Chacko said that stringent limits on cash withdrawals, non functioning of ATMs, and non availability of cash indicated the government’s unpreparedness to handle the situation. He said that withdrawing higher denomination currency is not going to make any major impact on the black economy since it did not address the genesis of the problem of black money generation.

1001,2016-12-11,34.0,Demonetisation: Construction workers feel the pinch,"Construction labourers waiting for work at Kuvempu Nagar in Mysuru.
  As many as 500 to 600 construction workers, hailing from villages in Nanjangud taluk and Chamarajanagar district, who come to Mysuru in search of work at sites, have been going back to their respective villages without getting work. This has been the case since post-demonetisation. One month had completed after the Centre banned the Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,000 notes on November 8. Many of these workers are illiterate and semi-literate, whose living solely rests on earning at the construction sites. Many had availed loans and are finding it tough to repay the credit. Post-demonetisation, many of them were not getting labour as either the construction work had been suspended over currency crisis or number of labourers employed at the sites had been cut. About 3,000 construction workers from many villages of Chamarajanagar district depend on the work they get in Mysuru for their livelihood. They arrive here in the train that departs from Chamarajanagar town in the morning and return to their villages by the evening train. Chamarajapuram station in the city is the alighting point for most workers who later assemble near the shopping complex at Kuvempunagar, where the contractors pick up them to their sites depending on the nature of work. Those, who are regularly employed by the contractors, had no problem and their work had not been affected since they are paid once a week. Workers from Chinnadagudihundi, Badanavalu, Hemmaragala, Kavalande, Nerale, Pannedahundi and other villages claim that work was not an issue at all before the currency ban since all of them were getting work daily and money. After the ban, the scope of work had declined. Shivaswamy, Siddappa, Chikkashetti and Mallikarjuna, workers in their late 30s, maintain that they had not been getting work regularly due to the currency ban and suspension of construction work. “We get around Rs. 400 daily and sometimes we settle to work for Rs. 350. People who employ us cite currency problem as reason for not giving them labour at the sites. In sites, where 10 labourers were working before the ban, only five work there. They don’t want to spend due to the crisis,” Shivaswamy and Siddappa said. Both Chikkashetti and Mallikarjuna claimed that at least 500-600 workers don’t get work on a regular basis and they return to their respective villages, hoping to get work the next day. “Some contractors ask us to work for less pay citing the current problem. They give a Rs. 2,000 note and ask us to share among the four or five workers due to the change problem. When they cannot get the change, where can we get as many of us have no bank accounts and not visited banks,” they said.

1002,2016-12-11,34.0,"I-T sleuths recover Rs. 5.7 crore in new currency in Chitradurga, Hubballi","A video grab shows the secret chamber in bathroom where money was stored.   Income Tax sleuths who searched the house of a financier at Chellakere in Chitradurga were shocked by the scale of what they found — a secret chamber covered with wall tiles in one of the bathrooms, which, when opened, revealed a cache of new currency. I-T officials searched three houses of Veerendra, also a businessman and allegedly involved in cricket betting, in the town. I-T officials did not find much in the three houses at first, but a more through search revealed the secret chamber. Veerendra is the son-in-law of a senior Kannada actor. The sleuths recovered a total of Rs. 5.7 crore in Rs. 2,000 notes during the searches on Saturday in Hubballi and Chitradurga, which makes it another major haul of new currency in the State following the recent seizure in Bengaluru. The sleuths also recovered Rs. 90 lakh in old currency, 28 kg of bullion and 4 kg of gold jewellery. The I-T Department targeted a clique of hawala and casino operators, and bullion traders who are also said to be deeply entrenched in cricket betting. One of the hawala operators was also actively involved in converting old notes and was accumulating bullion using old demonetised currency, a statement from I-T Department said. Searches were conducted at 15 locations in the State, with another jeweller and an alleged hawala operator Sumandhar Singh, being the target of search and seizure operations in Hubballi. The operations in the State is a continuation of the searches in Goa targeting a clique of hawala operators, during which sleuths picked up leads on those doing business with them, leading to search and seizure operations in the State.

1003,2016-12-12,35.0,People are frustrated over demonetisation: PCC chief,"VIJAYAWADA: People from various walks of life expressed frustration and desperation over the demonetisation of Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,000 notes and various problems they were facing after the move, at a roundtable conference organised by the Congress at Andhra Ratna Bhavan here on Monday. Andhra Pradesh Congress Committee president N. Raghuveera Reddy said that people from over two dozen civic societies and workers’ unions were invited to the roundtable to elicit their views on the impact of demonetisation. The doubts of the people at the roundtable would be raised in Parliament, the PCC chief said. The people had many doubts over the actual purpose of demonetisation and various steps that were being taken after it. Allegations were made about some influential people being tipped about demonetisation before November 8 so that they could take care of their liquid cash reserves. The Central government should appoint a sitting Supreme Court judge to inquire into the allegations, he demanded. Many of the speakers narrated the travails they were facing due to lack of sufficient currency. “Earlier customers asked if I was ready to go to a particular location, but now they are asking if I had change for Rs 2,000. The number of customers taking autorickshaws has fallen drastically,” said an autorickshaw driver. Auto Drivers’ Union leader V. Madhava Rao said in his three-decade stint as an auto driver he never saw such a severe crisis. Former office-bearer of the Institute of Engineers M.R.S. Prakasha Rao said that even he was unable to understand the logic behind demonetising Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,000 notes and then releasing Rs. 2,000 notes. Weavers’ Association leader K. Suribabu said that demonetisation had hit hard handloom weavers and Kalamkari workers. Two or three workers who were paid Rs. 150 to Rs. 200 a day were being given old Rs. 500 notes and asked to share. When the workers go to bank to exchange the old notes they were being given Rs. 2,000 notes which was more difficult to break up, he explained. PCC vice-president T.J.R. Sudhakar Babu, who was the moderator, took detailed notes of the representations made by the speakers.

They also urged the Centre to take immediate steps to provide enough currencies to cooperative institutions in rural areas, as they were serving farmers and villagers in a major way. They also urged the government to ensure education to all children up to the age of 14, enhance the subsidy for food and essential commodities, and increase the number of working days to 200 per year from the present 100 under Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme.

1005,2016-12-12,35.0,Weekly cattle markets in NK hit by demonetisation,"Dip in sales: The weekly cattle market at APMC yard in Vijayapura is struggling to find buyers post-demonetisation.
  Kashinath Bevinakatti, a farmer of Utnal village, has been bringing his pair of bulls to the weekly cattle market here for the past two weeks. They could have fetched him not less than Rs. 70,000. But, post-demonetisation, the situation has completely changed. “After failing to find a good customer for two weeks, I sold them for Rs. 38,000 as I was left with no choice. I have already spent around Rs. 3,000 for transporting the cattle and I could not afford any more,” he said. The scene is no different in Amingad cattle market in Hungund taluk of Bagalkot district, one of the biggest markets in the North Karnataka region. The weekly market normally records a business of around Rs. 10 lakh with the arrival of over 2,000 head of cattle. “ The business has come to almost a grinding halt after demonetisation. With the buyers facing acute financial crunch, farmers are unable to sell cattle for a good price. The business in Amingad market has now reduced to only around Rs. 3 lakh,” Shivappa Kaligouda, a cattle agent who is into this business for nearly two decades, said. He said that the farmers were forced to either sell the cattle for half the price or take them back which would cost them a bomb. Not just farmers, even mutton sellers say that their business has been hit by demonetisation. Moulali Kolhar, a mutton seller, said that before demonetisation, he used to buy around a dozen goats a week, but now he could buy only around five to six. Speaking to The Hindu, Sayed Istiyak Hamid, an expert in agriculture marketing, said that cattle trade was an intrinsic part of rural economy which was facing a major blow after demonetisation. “ For farmers, the livestock acts as additional source of revenue while for shepherds it is the only source of earning. The rural economy predominantly deals in cash and with no cash, the economy has literally crippled,” he added.

  Referring to the sufferings and inconveniences caused to the common man by demonetisation, M. Venkaiah Naidu, Minister for Information and Broadcasting, has urged the people to tolerate them for a better future of the country. He was addressing Kalyana Karnataka Vikasa Jatre at Geeta Nagar, off Sedam Road, here on Sunday. The event was organised by Vikas Academy, Kalaburagi, as part of the campaign to rename Hyderabad Karnataka as Kalyana Karnataka. “There would certainly be inconveniences and hardships in the initial stage when we take a big positive step. Demonetisation is one such step that is aimed at eradicating black money. We need to patiently endure it for a couple of more months for a better tomorrow,” Mr. Naidu said. Inevitable step He upheld demonetisation as an inevitable step for protecting the country from black money and counterfeit currency. “Black money is like a cancer. The treatment for black money should also be as hard as chemotherapy is for cancer. Cancer patient survives and leads a better life after undergoing successful chemotherapy. The country and the people will also have a better future after the demonetisation therapy,” he said. Mr. Naidu urged the people to use their mother tongue and promote it in their lives. “Don’t forget mother, mother tongue and motherland. I am not against learning English language. First, you should use your mother tongue in your daily life. Then learn our ‘rashtra bhasha’. Later, you can learn English as a language. Premiers of China and France and the President of Russia came to India and interacted with our Prime Minister in their mother tongue with the help of English translators. We should learn from them,” he said. Basavaraj Patil sedam, MP, and writer Go. Ru. Channabasappa were present.

1008,2016-12-12,35.0,Demonetisation: It?s a double whammy for Nepali population in Bengaluru,"For the sizeable Nepali population in the city, the past month has given two shocks. Their savings — a lot of which is sent back to their families in the hill kingdom — have been virtually nullified post-demonetisation even as the new Rs. 500 and Rs. 2,000 notes have been banned in Nepal. In Kempapura, Ram (name changed) and his extended relatives work as watchmen, cooks and others in the area. As Nepali, they have the legal right to work in the country; however, they carry little ID proof apart from their Nepali citizenship card. “Cumulatively, we have savings of over Rs. 53,000, and we need to carry this to our families when we visit in a few months. Without an Indian identity, we cannot even get our savings exchanged,” he said. After a gap of over two years, he will be seeing his family in a couple of months. Like many Nepalis working in the city, they have had to rely on the kindness of their employers to exchange their cash. Or they have had to do so through a network within their fraternity where those with bank accounts have help out those without. “Those who have the original Nepali passport are exchanging their money at the banks. Others prefer to give their old notes to local shopkeepers, who charge a commission of Rs. 100 per Rs. 1,000 note,” said Prinkal Thapa, director of Nepalese in India, an organisation concerned with the welfare of the community here. A watchman at Sanjaynagar says he has managed to get his savings of Rs. 20,000 converted to valid notes, primarily the new ones, but cannot take the cash to his family as the new notes were, in the last week of November, banned in Nepal. Many members of the community tend to carry cash — accumulated over the year — in hand when going home. While a few of his friends, who had travelled to Nepal a week ago, exchanged the notes for Nepalese Rupee in the border towns of Bihar, where the trade thrives illegally, he said he would, for the first time, use the banking channels (money transfer) to ensure his savings reach his family.

1009,2016-12-13,36.0,Solve currency problem before January: Naidu to bankers,"VIJAYAWADA: Chief Minister N. Chandrababu Naidu has asked the bankers to solve the currency problem in next 17 days. Addressing a teleconference on demonetisation here on Tuesday, Mr. Naidu stressed the need to ease the situation before January. Petty traders can open current accounts to tide over the currency problem. Bankers should guide them to open current accounts and also switch over to cashless transactions. Small traders were facing procedural issues in opening current accounts, he pointed out. It was necessary to prepare people to adopt cashless transactions, and for which it was necessary to put in place the necessary infrastructure. The banks would have to bring in unified procedures to promote mobile transactions. A single M-PIN for mobile transactions would go a long way. At present, banks were issuing individual M-PIN leading to confusion among the users, he felt. The amount deposited in accounts of DWCRA group women and pensioners would be put to use immediately. The cash available to these sections of society increases currency circulation. The banks would have to take cognisance of the fact and give priority to the DWCRA groups and pensioners. Mr. Naidu said the State government would launch cashless transactions at all fair price shops from January. Officials and fair price shop owners would have to ensure that Christmas and Sankranti gifts reached the ration cardholders properly. It was an excellent opportunity for the ration shop dealers to work as business correspondents also, he said. District Collectors, SLBC convener Ranganath, RBI official Subbaiah and others were present. Singapore model At another review meeting on revenue, Mr. Naidu asked the officials to follow the procedures of Singapore government to improve revenue. The Singapore government has been increasing its revenue by investing in foreign countries in addition to available economic resources. Every rupee should be counted in government expenditure, he said. Special Chief Secretary (Finance) Ajeya Kallam said they were carrying out financial transactions online. However, they are facing some problems due to lack of coordination between Treasuries, banks and RBI. Revenue came down by Rs. 200 crore in November compared to October, he said. Mr. Kallam said AP was likely to receive Rs 1,000 crore from Nabard towards Polavaram project.

The case was detected during a surprise check which revealed a huge difference in the number of old currency received and the actual bank records. Yet another head cashier with the State Bank of Bikaner in Rajasthan’s Dausa branch, Yogendra Singh Meena, has been arrested for allegedly facilitating the exchange of over Rs. 1 crore in old notes. These cases come after the arrest on Monday of K.C. Veerendra, a local JD(S) politician who also runs a casino, after Rs. 5.7 crore in new notes was seized by the Income-Tax Department from his premises. The CBI has registered a case against unknown officials of the State Bank of India, the State Bank of Mysore, ICICI Bank and Kotak Mahindra Bank, for allegedly conspiring with Veerendra. The CBI has also taken legal action against officials of Dhanlaxmi Bank and the Central Bank of India on allegations of a similar type. The CBI had earlier arrested Parashivamurthy, head cashier of the Kollegal branch of the State Bank of Mysore, and another person for allegedly exchanging over Rs. 1.51 crore. “Four cases each have been registered in Hyderabad and Bengaluru. While in Hyderabad, the cases have been registered for alleged illegal exchanges at various post offices, the four cases in Bengaluru involve bank officials,” an investigation officer said. “The initial cumulative amount as per the cases registered till Tuesday stands at about Rs. 19 crore. The figure may go up during investigations.” (With inputs from Bengaluru Bureau) Printable version | Jan 7, 2017 1:44:14 AM | http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/Kolkata-bank-officials-held-over-currency-exchange/article16801763.ece © The Hindu Be it nature’s fury or man’s folly, destructions are alike.

And save the difficulties caused by demonetisation, the Christmas market is alive and kicking. “People coming to buy the decorations with Rs.2,000 notes is our biggest problem. We rarely have enough change for then,” says Arnold, an employee at a popular decorations store in Kozhikode. However, the shops take extra care not to discourage any customer for want of change. “We accept even old notes. Credit and debit cards are also accepted,” says Nawaz, an employee at a Nadakkavu shop, who has been in the business for a decade. “Business is as usual. Just like the previous Christmas season,” he adds. The LED stars are the most sought-after products this year. Electronic crackers that sound similar to fireworks are also popular this season.

| Photo Credit: PTI Taking his battle against Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the decision on demonetisation outside Delhi, Congress vice president Rahul Gandhi on Tuesday slammed the former for “waging a war” against poor people. Addressing a crowd at the anaj mandi (grain market) in Dadri, in poll-bound Uttar Pradesh, the Congress vice-president alleged that demonetisation was a means for the Modi government to waive the bad loans of the corporates using the hard-earned money of the poor. While interacting with the local residents of Dadri, Mr. Gandhi said, “Modi ji wants your money to be in the banks for the maximum possible time. The reason for this is that he wants to use your hard earned money to write off bad loans of his corporate friends.” Mr. Gandhi accused Mr Modi of the shifting goalposts since November 8 when the government demonetised the Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,000 notes. “The Prime Minister's narrative over demonetisation has repeatedly changed. First he pitched it as a move aimed at ending corruption and counterfeiting. But as the month progressed, the narrative seemed to have shifted towards war against terror. After a month progressed, he has started talking about digitisation and making the society cashless,” added Mr. Gandhi. “Prime Minister Modi is talking about making the society cashless. People are suffering as they have actually gone cashless,” Mr Gandhi said. He also told the gathering that while Mr Modi pitched demonetisation as a move against black money hoarders, it was the illegal group which was “least affected”. “Do you see even a single rich person or black money hoarder in queue? They are having no such problem as they are taking money from back doors,” he alleged. “The government says demonetisation was against fake currency. But fake currency is only 0.02 paisa in every Rs. 100,” the Congress vice-president told Dadri’s residents.

1013,2016-12-13,36.0,"FM hints at low tax rates due to demonetisation, digi-payments","Finance Minister Arun Jaitley on Tuesday hinted at lower direct and indirect tax rates in the future as demonetisation results in higher tax revenues from unaccounted wealth coming into system. He also warned of a “very heavy price” that unscrupulous elements will have to pay for amassing large amounts of cash unlawfully, saying agencies are keeping a close eye on cash accumulations. The November 8 announcement by the government to demonetise high value notes has in one stroke junked 86 per cent of the currency in circulation and holders of the discontinued notes can deposit them in banks before the end of the year and withdraw money in new currency. The money being deposited has to be accounted for and taxes paid — 50 per cent on voluntary disclosures of unaccounted money and 85 per cent for any failures. “So much money...operating as loose cash in the system has today come into the banking system,” he said. “It has to be accounted for. Where taxes have not been paid will now be recovered.” Jaitley said future transactions would be substantially digital as India moves towards a less-cash society. “Once they are substantially digital they get caught in tax net,” he said. “Therefore the future taxation level would be much higher than what is currently being collected. This would also enable the government at some stage to make taxes more reasonable which will apply to both direct and indirect taxes.” Demonetisation together with other reforms, particularly the GST and the restrictions on cash spending subjected to PAN declaration, will bring down the levels of corruption in society, he said. “It is going to bring down cash transaction in society and it’s going to bring down levels of evasion as far as taxation is concerned,” he said. Jaitley said it has come to the notice of the government that some unscrupulous people, including some in the banking system and others, have been trying to subvert the system once again and have accumulated large amounts of cash unlawfully. “Obviously there is a breach of law in this and this is a step which hurts the economy. And therefore all agencies have an eye on this. They will investigate this matter and all those who are indulging in this malpractices will have to pay a very heavy price for what they are doing,” he added.

1016,2016-12-13,36.0,Rise in use of plastic money after demonetisation: survey,"There has been a rise in the use of credit and debit cards following the demonetisation initiative, with 37.4 per cent Indian travellers choosing plastic money over cash for bookings and other travel-related expenditure, a survey has said. “The ban on old Rs.500 and Rs. 1,000 notes has further led to a significant 57.9 per cent oftravellers booking on desktop computers, and a drastic dip in booking through offline agents,”the Winter Survey by Yatra.com has shown. With demonetisation, the trend of cashless transactions in travel will go up, and this will have significant medium to long-term positives for online travel agents, Yatra.com COO,(B2C), Sharat Dhall said. The Winter Survey is done by Yatra.com annually from data taken from the actual bookings done on the portal. Another key observation was that people are preferring to choose budget accommodation over luxury accommodation. Over 38 per cent people opted for lodging options under Rs. 4,000, while only 35 per cent chose luxury accommodation, it added. It said the advance booking continues with most people looking at finalising their plans 15 days to one month in advance. Further, it said, demonetisation does not seem to have impacted the spending capacity of travellers, with over 60 per cent willing to spend between Rs.10,000 and Rs.25,000. The survey also found a substantial drop in international travel, with over 74 per cent respondents willing to travel to domestic destinations. While the deserts and Goahave been highlighted as top choices amongst domestic destinations, Thailand and other islands top the list of most favoured international destinations. “Our Winter Survey shows that mobile bookings and the preference for budget accommodation are two areas where we are seeing a tremendous surge. Contrary to the usual preference of international destinations, we have seen a number of travellers opting for domestic destinations this winter,” Mr. Dhall said. Contrary to last year’s Winter Survey, the findings this year reveal that spouses/ partners werethe more obvious choice as travel companions, followed by family, friends and solo travel.  Printable version | Jan 7, 2017 1:44:27 AM | http://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/article16799633.ece © The Hindu SamBar, the new resto-bar that’s replaced Khar’s Loca Loca, has inventive cocktails and fun finger food inspired by the cuisine from south of the Vindhyas"

  Congress vice president Rahul Gandhi on Wednesday expressed his solidarity with Kerala’s United Democratic Front (UDF) which has been fighting to have primary cooperative banks in the State opened, ever since the demonetisation measure was announced last month. “I am with the people of Kerala; I am with the leadership of the UDF,” Mr Gandhi said, addressing a sit-in organised by the UDF at Jantar Mantar. The UDF leaders were here also to meet President Pranab Mukherjee to present him with a memorandum on the hardships rural folk have been suffering with the closure of the primary cooperative banks in which most of them have accounts. Acknowledging that Kerala had been badly affected by demonetisation, he said, “Your leaders have told me that the State has been devastated because the cooperative sector that is so important in Kerala has been hit. This is a monumental disaster.” Addressing the dharna, former Defence Minister A.K.

1019,2016-12-14,37.0,Cong. to hit the streets on demonetisation after winter session,"The Congress has decided to take to the people the “complete failure of the government’s stated objectives” for undertaking demonetisation as soon as the winter session of Parliament ends on Friday through an aggressive, countrywide campaign, top party sources told The Hindu. This was the decision taken at a meeting of party MPs and national general secretaries at the Congress’s war room on Gurdwara Rakabganj Road on Wednesday. The discussion was presided over by party vice-president Rahul Gandhi, who made both the initial and concluding remarks. As many as 22 others spoke, as the party’s top leaders brainstormed on the campaign. Four rallies Mr. Gandhi himself will address four public rallies, one each in the northern, southern, eastern and western parts of the country. All top leaders have been asked to fan out through the length and breadth of India, also to address public meetings, even as party units have been told to get activated at different levels on the demonetisation issue. This plan has the blessings of Congress President Sonia Gandhi: party sources said that she had been advocating that the party should hit the streets. Initially, the Congress had been measured in its response as it wished to see how the demonetisation exercise rolled out. “The theme of the campaign will be that the so-called stated objectives of the demonetisation exercise — to end terrorism, to make use of counterfeit money and black money impossible — have failed,” a senior Congress leader, who attended the meeting, said. It was repeatedly stressed during the discussion that the message would have to be taken “aggressively” to the people. Party communication chief Randeep Surjewala added that the Congress would also emphasise through the campaign that the party stood with the people on the hardships they were facing. Graft allegations Reference was made to Mr. Gandhi’s press conference earlier in the day to the allegations of corruption that he had made against Prime Minister Narendra Modi: many of the speakers said that if those details were made public, it would give ballast to the Congress campaign against the government that had said the demonetisation exercise was an attack on corruption. However, Mr. Gandhi is learnt to have said that he would prefer to make another attempt to present those details in Parliament — if he fails to do so by Friday, then a fresh strategy will be worked out on how to disseminate that information. Meanwhile, it is learnt that other opposition parties are also making plans to take forward the aggression — and solidarity — of their parliamentary wings to the streets. This week, for three days, for instance, 200-odd Trinamool Congress MLAs will be demonstrating in front of the Reserve Bank in Kolkata. Ajit Singh’s Rashtriya Lok Dal, too, will shortly be holding a rally at Baghara near Muzaffarnagar in western Uttar Pradesh. Former Prime Minister and JD(S) leader H.D. Deve Gowda, JD(U) leader Sharad Yadav, and the NCP will participate in the rally: the new guests this time will be from the Trinamool, sources in that party said.

While the stall owners have witnessed a marked drop in sales due to the impact of demonetisation, they are pinning their hopes on the upcoming festive and holiday season which has traditionally been a peak business period for exhibition organisers. “Our sales have dropped by over 60 per cent this season post demonetisation. We had a particularly dull experience in Mumbai which was held immediately after the demonetisation was announced,” said Rizwan from Kashmir.

However, it is way below the average. We are returning from Kerala where we had a no-profit and no-loss business, which itself is a promising sign for us in times like this,” said a participant from Gujarat.

1023,2016-12-14,37.0,Debating demonetisation,"  The articles, “Not a tragedy, but the remedy” (Dec.13) and “Asking the right questions” (Dec.12), responses to Dr. Manmohan Singh’s article, “Makings of a mammoth tragedy” (Dec.9), raise an issue. It is unfortunate that any decision taken by the government is subject to politics. The fact is that the two articles focussed largely on criticising Dr. Singh’s government and defending demonetisation without taking any responsibility for the inconvenience being caused to the masses. Hardly anyone is questioning demonetisation as a principle — something these articles are constantly portraying — but the way it has been implemented. What does the lack of money in the economy have to do with the surplus created by the NDA government in the early 2000s? Naveen Rattu, Chandigarh The banks that the experts claim exist in villages have little or hardly any money. ATMs, if there are any, do not dispense cash. Cooperative banks do not function on account of the government’s unfair policy. Demonetisation has only caused hardship to the common man and affected the economy. Kevin Tom Jose, Kanhangad, Kerala The sentence “the then Finance Secretary did not think it was a mammoth tragedy... what was logical in 1978 should continue to be logical in 2016” is an unfair dig at Dr. Singh. There is no comparison between what was done then and now. In 1978, the Rs.1,000 note was hardly used; neither were the Rs.5,000 and Rs.10,000 notes. Their demonetisation was of no consequence whatsoever to the common man. Today, demonetising Rs.500 has affected many of us as it is a denomination that is the new Rs.100. V. Krishnamachari, Mumbai While Dr. Singh’s article made a cogently argued case against demonetisation — all without recourse to jargon — I did not find any substantial argument in Bibek Debroy’s response. In fact, the last point that he makes about the Payment of Wages Act of 1936, mandating the use of coins and currency notes, is very odd. I am sure that jute mill owners in the 1930s would have loved this. They would have then paid their workers wages in the form of bales of jute cloth, asking them to barter this for food and clothes. Almost all civilisations did away with barter as a means of trade centuries ago. As for the amendments that he expected the previous government to make to this rule between 2004 and 2014 or even earlier, the logic used is beyond comprehension. Bhashyam Srinivasan, Bengaluru It does not make sense to compare high-value notes that nobody has seen, barring the mega-rich, to today’s Rs.500 and Rs.1,000 notes. In the earlier instance of demonetisation, it was only the real black money hoarders who were impacted. In the move in 2016, almost everyone has been hit. While Mr. Debroy tries to contest Dr. Singh’s claim of banking penetration, he doesn’t seem to have the real numbers. The government’s “spokespersons” should realise that it is becoming increasingly difficult to defend demonetisation, which has failed spectacularly. The government has also failed miserably to anticipate the moves of hoarders, resulting in the laundering of black money. The government has been shifting the goalposts. Demonetisation may only help banks get some money which they can possibly lend to the corporate sector.

R.V. Moorthy Senior Congress leader and former Union Finance Minister P. Chidambaram said on Tuesday that the government’s decision to withdraw high-denomination currency was a “calamity” that had caused “indescribable” pain in rural India. Addressing a press conference in Nagpur, he said: “No economy can function if 86 per cent of the country’s currency is immobilised and impounded.” It would take a minimum of seven months to print currency notes to replace the withdrawn banknotes, he said, adding, “and for this period you and I will have to stand in queue virtually begging for our own money.”  Demonetisation is a war against the poor, says Rahul Mr. Chidambaram said the decision to print Rs.2,000 notes was flawed and made life “easy” for currency-hoarders. He also termed the decision to exclude the District Central Cooperative Banks from the currency exchange process a way of “punishing” the farmers. “The farmers are left with no money to buy seeds, fertilizers and to hire labour.”  In a strongly worded rejoinder, Union Finance Minister Arun Jaitley said the comments were not surprising given the previous government’s record in battling corruption.  Congress extremely uncomfortable given scandalous record: FM He said the Congress was “extremely uncomfortable with the anti-corruption campaign that the NDA government led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi has launched.” Mr. Jaitley said the re-monetisation process was continuing rapidly, “notwithstanding some transient problem which people have to face.” “Significant amounts are going to be injected in the next three weeks” which would gradually ease the pressure, he said. He also dangled the possibility of a future cut in tax rates as a direct consequence of the government’s decision. “Future transaction would be substantially digital, and once they are substantially digital, they would come in the tax net,” Mr. Jaitley said. “Therefore, the future taxation level would be much higher than what is currently being collected. This would also enable the government at some stage to make taxes more reasonable.” Printable version | Jan 7, 2017 1:44:48 AM | http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/Demonetisation-a-%E2%80%98calamity%E2%80%99-says-Chidambaram/article16802479.ece © The Hindu Be it nature’s fury or man’s folly, destructions are alike.

1027,2016-12-14,37.0,Agriculture credit societies ready to sail with demonetisation wind,"MANGALURU: While many representatives of farmers’ societies were willing to follow the Reserve Bank of India norms to be eligible as “banks” to overcome the demonetisation blues, the South Canara District Cooperative Central (SCDCC) Bank, as an interim measure, on Tuesday decided to urge the State government to extend the deadline for agriculture loan repayment till normality is restored. The bank had convened a meeting of heads of primary agriculture credit societies (PACS) and the Vyavasaya Seva Sahakari Sanghas here to discuss ways to face the demonetisation impact. Bank president M.N. Rajendra Kumar said keeping PACS out of “bank” definition has adversely impacted the rural economy. He said more than 60 per cent rural population transacts through the cooperative sector. Prohibition on PACS from receiving demonetised notes has affected them. RBI’s treatment of PACS on par with individuals limiting their cash withdrawal to Rs. 50,000 a week has affected cash flow. This issue should be raised with RBI and the Union government. Mr. Rajendra Kumar also feared PACS could be in trouble if agriculture loans are not repaid by March 2017 following demonetisation. PACS’ trouble would impact the whole cooperative sector. Ready for KYC Presidents/ CEOs of PACS and VSS said SCDCC Bank has to take the lead in urging RBI not to equate cooperative banks with individuals. At the same time, PACS cannot sit dumb to the changing irreversible economic trends and should ask the RBI/ Union government to provide them IFSC codes to function as regular banks. “We are ready to follow KYC (know your customer) norms and even pay income tax on profits earned,” one said. Another said cooperatives earned a bad name because some began functioning as “finances” offering lucrative rates of interest on deposits throwing all norms. Another representative said PACS are prepared to go for cashless transactions and SCDCC Bank should take the lead in implementing the same. Those who spoke included Prakashchandra Shetty from Khambadakone CA Bank, Thimma Poojary from Kota CA Bank, M.S. Gokhale from Mundaje PACS, Vasanth Majal from Belthangady PACS, G. Anand from Bantwal VSS, Mahesh Hegde from Molahalli VSS and others.

1028,2016-12-14,37.0,"Thanks to demonetisation, child marriages go down","Demonetisation has a telling effect on both economic and social activities, but it seems to have led to a drastic reduction in child marriages in Sangareddy district. The marriage season usually commences from August and stretches till March. During this period, Child Line, an NGO working on child rights, gets about 150 calls complaining of child marriages. During the peak season - between November and December second week - the NGO gets the maximum calls (about 30-35) from unknown sources requesting to stop the child marriages. But that has reduced drastically and the Union Government attributes it to demonetisation that has made getting hand loans difficult in rural areas. Villagers acknowledge this fact stating that they are not even getting loans to purchase seed and fertilizer, leave alone marriages. Another reason for reduction in child marriages is said to be the recent rains that lashed Telangana bringing to life the dried-up ponds and bore-wells. “Owing to severe drought conditions, farmers were unsure of their future and hence opted for performing their daughters’ wedding as soon as possible. But due to heavy rains, their hope of getting a good yield and returns multiplied. So they put off the weddings,” explains M.S. Chandra, Director, Child Line. “With demonetisation, their hands are tied as they are not getting hand loans. We have only received six calls requesting to stop the weddings of which we have managed to stop five,” he says.

1029,2016-12-15,38.0,Demonetisation a visionary step: Shah,"BJP chief Amit Shah at a meeting of office-bearers in Delhi on Thursday.
  BJP president Amit Shah on Thursday exhorted his team of party national office-bearers to campaign for push for a “less cash” economy and said demonetisation was a “visionary” step taken by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, one that not “merely looks good” but “did what was good” for the people of the country. Mr. Shah was addressing a closed door meeting of party office-bearers in New Delhi. “Demonetisation is a visionary decision of political will aimed at curbing black money and corruption. The parties criticising it are doing so out of political malice. But the mandate we have received is not for taking decisions which merely look good to people but which are good for them. We will not remain confined to small reforms but bring about fundamental changes in the economy,” Mr. Shah reportedly said, according to a senior office-bearer present at the meeting. A senior party leader quoted Mr. Shah as saying that it is “imperative to kill parallel economy running on black money to boost the country’s resources so that it can invest heavily in education, health and other sectors.” Mr. Shah’s comments to office-bearers comes a day after he held a meeting of 36 party MPs from eastern Uttar Pradesh, a crucial State that goes to polls early next year. According to MPs present at the meeting, the feedback on the demonetisation decision and implementation had been sought from them. Out of these 36 MPs, around 24 spoke at the meeting, according to a source and the general sense that was conveyed to the party chief was that while the decision and its initial impact had been positively received by the people of the area, the situation entering the third week of December was disappointing. “The lines before banks are not ending and that is creating difficulties for people, especially in the semi rural and rural areas. The surgical strikes against Pakistan had created a positive atmosphere for the party and so had the early days of demonetisation. The remonetisation process needs to be calibrated,” was the message conveyed to Mr. Shah, a senior MP said. BJP national secretary Shrikant Sharma, who spoke to the media after Thursday’s meeting, said the office-bearers, who included State in-charges, shared ground feedback on demonetisation.

1030,2016-12-15,38.0,Demonetisation impact continues,"A long queue of public waiting in front of the SBI ATM in Tiruchi on Tuesday.  
| Photo Credit: 
M. Moorthy With more than five weeks since the announcement on demonetisation came into force, the impact is being felt across the district by citizens, particularly the working classes. Many Automated Teller Machines are yet to be re-opened since November 10, forcing the customers to rely on the available ATM units. The ATM corner of the State Bank of India’s main branch in the city has been remaining overcrowded for the past three days, although it was a public holiday on Tuesday in the wake of Milad un Nabi. The demonetisation has hit hard the ready-made garment industry in Puthanatham, a tiny village involved in making ready-made garments. The village, lying on the Tiruchi - Madurai national highway, accounts for 50 promising entrepreneurs and each generates assured employment round-the-year for at least six tailors. “The purchase from wholesale market across the State has come down since the announcement on demonetisation”, says a cross section of entrepreneurs. The trade is a cottage industry in the village, with members of families eking out their livelihood on the ‘division of labour’ basis. Barring jeans, the rest of ready-made apparel is manufactured here in plenty. The latest designs of short churis and children's apparel, are manufactured here by well-experienced tailors, who had inherited the professional expertise traditionally down an ancestral lineage. Production of trade had been affected to a great extent. “With the serious fall in the orders, the traders have started slowing down their production,” they said. With the New Year and ‘Pongal’ festival round the corner, the demonetisation has come as a severe blow to them, they said. Aranthangi At Avanathankottai near Aranthangi, members of the public turned berserk when bank officials informed that the ATM had run out of cash. The villagers, mostly women, who waited for about three hours for their turn, resorted to a stir. Police officials rushed to the spot and pacified them. Steps were taken to enable them to withdraw cash.

1031,2016-12-15,38.0,Demonetisation?s narrative,"  The article, “Why ‘cashless’ may be the new normal” (Dec.14), brings out issues that are becoming evident even to the uninitiated in this protracted roll-out of demonetisation with shifting goalposts. There is no alternative than going plastic is what is being thrown down disdainfully as a solution to this fait accompli of demonetisation. The reason of market economics is being cited, but no thought is being spared for the welfare of the poor and illiterate masses who are being ruthlessly pushed into a mode of transaction which they can hardly understand or control. Even for the educated, security in Net operations is an issue. Finally, it is clear that demonetisation is definitely not about black money. Shorn of its moral veneer, it is all about a state-finance nexus to the detriment of vast sections of people and their livelihoods. Vijayalakshmi B., Hyderabad Every day there are reports of diversion of new Rs.2,000 and Rs.500 notes into the hands of the rich and the unscrupulous, which is in sharp contrast to the common man who is still struggling to withdraw Rs.2,000 from his/her account. How else does one explain the long queues outside ATMs? The demonetisation exercise is going off track and is like waiting for a bucket with holes to get full. K. Vijayaraghavan, Hyderabad The cause for demonetisation is to attack black money, money laundering, terrorism and market informality. These are laudable but the fact is that many of us are suffering due to the cash crunch. Casual labourers are the hardest hit. The digital world is unknown to them. The government needs to have an army of volunteers who can repose their faith in digitisation and address their fears. It is only then that a cashless economy can be made the new normal. Jashandeep Kaur Ahluwalia, Khanna, Punjab The sudden cash crunch is forcing many to move towards alternative methods of payment. But do we have adequate education about Internet banking? In government schools, for instance, how many students know how to operate a computer? The concept of smart classes is very important. Technological infrastructure must be improved in government schools as it is from here that a chunk of the population will come into the informal sector. To expect a daily wage labourer to carry out an online payment is unrealistic but we can teach his children how to do it. Vivek Mohan, Dehradun The fact that people are now diverting new denominations into their accounts shows how some persons are ahead of the system. Demonetisation is one method to curb black money but there are more structured approaches that are needed to curb the generation of black money. Tax reforms are needed but there need to be more incentives for honest taxpayers. High-value deals such as real estate and jewellery need to be made more transparent and payment by cheque or online payment only accepted. It is a long and hard battle against corruption before India can improve its standing from being one of the most corrupt countries. D.B.N. Murthy, Bengaluru Even a month after its inception, I fail to comprehend the whole ‘circus of demonetisation’. At the advent, the government brought in the issue of black money, counterfeit currency and terrorism. Now, it is taking shelter under the umbrella of ‘Digital India’ and ‘transforming India into a cashless economy’. Statistics show that less than 1 per cent of currency is counterfeit. Also, a very marginal amount of black money generated is stored as cash. No measure by the government, irrespective of its goodwill, should come at the cost of the lives of the very people it aims to serve. The government needs to be less ideological and more pragmatic in its approach in this traumatising business of demonetisation.

1032,2016-12-15,38.0,"Demonetisation will lead to recession, says economist","Economist and former JNU professor Prabhat Patnaik addressing a meeting on demonetisation, in Visakhapatnam on Wednesday.  
| Photo Credit: C.V.Subrahmanyam VISAKHAPATNAM: “The present state of Indian economy does not permit demonetisation. In the present context, it is an absurdity. It will lead to decimation of the informal sector,” says Prabhat Patnaik, economist and former professor of Jawaharlal Nehru University. Delivering a lecture on ‘Economic reforms, demonetisation and the insurance sector’, organised here on Wednesday by the Visakhapatnam Insurance Institute, Prof. Patnaik pointed out that demonetisation would not only give short-term pain to the people but also affect the economy in the long run. It, therefore, should be resisted by all sections of society, he said. Highly critical of the government’s argument that it was intended to check black money and weed out counterfeit notes from the market, he said it was like administering a very powerful antibiotic for treating a small ailment. Demonetisation was used as a tool in many countries such as Venezuela, where the inflation rate was over 500 per cent. “In India, the inflation rate is hardly 5 per cent. So, don’t you think that it is a wasteful exercise?” he questioned. “Moreover, demonetisation is not necessary to check circulation of counterfeit currency notes. The old high-value notes could have been withdrawn in a phased manner. For a while, both the old and new notes could have been legal tender. In fact, the UPA Government did it with some notes,” he pointed out. Prof. Patnaik further said that the rationale behind the fight against black money did not hold water. “The whole idea is absurd, and all the economists are in disagreement with the move. It is now clear that almost 90 per cent of the scrapped currency is coming back to the banks and the impact on black economy as a whole is minimal,” he said. Prof. Patnaik said that demonetisation was hitting the poor and the informal sector hard. The farm sector and the informal sector, which comprise 47 per cent, were the worst-affected, he said. He pointed out that the economy would move into a recession in the aftermath of demonetisation and “there would be considerable impact on the GDP.” On cashless transactions, Prof. Patnaik said: “It is just a red herring. Moreover, cashless transaction is costlier. Why should people, especially the poorer sections, be forced to switch to cashless transactions? It is despotic, undemocratic, and unconstitutional to force the people to adopt the system.” Printable version | Jan 7, 2017 1:45:08 AM | http://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Visakhapatnam/Demonetisation-will-lead-to-recession-says-economist/article16807437.ece © The Hindu The double decker train, sanctioned between Visakhapatnam-Vijayawada, will soon begin its run, according to Union Railway Minister Suresh Prabhu.The M"

  The impact of scrapping of two-high value notes and the ceiling limit imposed on withdrawals has adversely affected the District Central Cooperative Banks (DCC) in Mandya, Ramanagaram, Bengaluru Urban and Bengaluru Rural districts, with milk producers being instructed to open accounts in nationalised banks for receiving payments. Over 2.47 lakh dairy farmers from these districts, who supply milk through 3,227 milk producers’ cooperative societies (MPCS) to two Milk Manufacturers’ Unions, have not received payments since the demonetisation of Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,000 notes came into effect on November 9. Of the 3,227 MPCS, around 50 per cent are all-women cooperative milk producers’ societies. The Mandya Milk Manufacturers’ Union Ltd. (MANMUL) has 1.12 lakh registered dairy farmers, while the Bangalore Milk Union Ltd. (BAMUL) has 1.35 lakh milk suppliers in Ramanagaram, Bengaluru Rural and Bengaluru Urban districts. The procurement of milk from both unions is around 24 lakh (around 8 lakh from MANMUL) litres a day. Delay in payment The non-availability of cash at DCC banks and weekly restrictions have severely affected the milk suppliers. The demonetisation has left them with no choice but to receive their payment once or twice in a month, R.K. Ramesh, chairman, BAMUL, told The Hindu. The Unions disburse payment to MPCS accounts at DCC banks, through online transfers, and instruct the MPCS secretaries to pay the suppliers in cash once in a week. Nevertheless, the secretaries are unable to withdraw the required amount from the DCC banks following the weekly ceiling restrictions. Moreover, DCC banks have not installed ATM kiosks in rural areas. New accounts Following the cash crisis, the MPCS and milk suppliers have been asked to open accounts at nationalised banks, N.G. Prabhudev, manager, Lead Bank of Mandya (Vijaya Bank), told The Hindu. Once the process of opening accounts at nationalised banks is completed, the MPCSs will transfer the payments from the MPCS accounts to the bank accounts of milk suppliers, a senior officer at the MANMUL said. According to BAMUL officials, secretaries at MPCS and milk suppliers in Ramanagaram, Bengaluru Urban and Bengaluru Rural districts have also been asked to open accounts at nationalised banks.

1034,2016-12-15,38.0,Demonetisation puts curbs on cash-for-referral racket,"Demonetisation has hit the practice of giving doctors a commission for referring patients to a particular pathology laboratory or radiology outlet. A certain percentage of money earned on diagnostic tests, medical check-ups and surgical procedures is handed over to doctors in return for their referral. The commission ranges from 15 per cent to 40 per cent. The practice is so widespread that newly opened diagnostic centres fear that they would have to shut shop if they do not pay up. A radiologist, on condition of anonymity, said, “The practice is facing a crisis. People who give the commission have no cash now and doctors are refusing to accept the money in cash. Radiologists are planning to take advantage of the situation to put an end to the practice.” He said, “The practice is so blatant that doctors threaten radiologists if they refuse to pay their share. Radiology centres fear they will lose business to their competitors if they don’t oblige. But after demonetisation, there is tremendous resistance from the doctors. They don’t want the commission in cash anymore.” Dr. Prasad Kulkarni, executive member, Maharashtra Association of Practicing Pathologists and Microbiologists, said, “Attempts to stop the practice have been made earlier too. No association supports the unethical practice, but ground realities are different. It is good that doctors are discussing ways to end this practice.” Dr. Kulkarni also said that patients should also be wise enough to approach doctors who are ethical. In 2014, there was heated discussion on the practice in the medical fraternity after a doctor filed a compliant with the Maharashtra Medical Council (MMC). Dr. H.S. Bawaskar from Mahad said he received a cheque of Rs. 1,200 as ‘professional services’ from NM Medical Centre in Pune for referring a patient there for a CT scan. Dr. Bawaskar said he had not referred any centre to his patient. The complaint highlighted how doctors were being lured into giving referrals to certain diagnostic centres. Dr. Bawaskar’s complaint led the MMC to frame charges against NM Medical Centre for violating its code of ethics. While big centres can afford to pay by cheque, smaller centres still make the payment in cash. “I wonder if such big diagnostic centres run by corporates can be put in check,” said Dr. Kulkarni.

1035,2016-12-15,38.0,Demonetisation?s deflationary shock?,"That the Centre’s decision to withdraw high-denomination banknotes was going to impact economic activity in the short term was never in doubt. But the specific contours of the effects were probably a lot less understood at the time of that announcement. The deflationary shock has manifested itself in a deceleration in retail inflation, as demand for a range of goods and services has been damped. That the headline Consumer Price Index-based gauge hit a two-year low of 3.63 per cent for November is therefore no surprise, especially given the additional factor of a favourable base effect — the reading was 5.41 per cent in November 2015. The major contributor to the slowdown in price gains was the food and beverages group, where inflation eased to 2.56 per cent largely on the back of a slump in the prices of vegetables, a highly perishable commodity. But a closer look at the food group throws the spotlight on some trends that the Reserve Bank of India had flagged in its latest monetary policy review as areas of concern. Specifically, the prices of sugar and confectionery accelerated by 22.4 per cent while meat and fish and egg also reflected persistently elevated levels. The services sectors, including transport and communication and education, also manifested stickiness, underscoring the rationale for the RBI’s cautious approach in keeping benchmark interest rates unchanged. Clearly, signals from the inflation data pose a conundrum before policymakers. With demand impulses taking a wide-ranging knock from the shortage of cash in the hands of consumers, proponents of policy accommodation would argue that the time is ripe for the RBI to cut borrowing costs to help impart some credit-fuelled economic momentum. But as the RBI’s Monetary Policy Committee itself articulated it on December 7, “while discretionary spending on goods and services in the CPI excluding food and fuel” could have been affected by restricted access to cash, the prices of those items may weather the transitory effects since they are normally revised according to preset cycles. More importantly, the MPC cautioned that food inflation pressures could re-emerge as a consequence of disruptions in agricultural activity as a result of the currency withdrawal. The spectre of upward price pressures from key components including food and fuel — OPEC’s output cuts are already pushing up crude oil — combined with the fading away of a favourable base effect could leave the RBI with little wiggle room to support growth. With the central bank’s March 2017 target for retail inflation of 5 per cent clearly in their sights, the monetary authorities may be persuaded to keep the powder dry.

Ashok, president of Karnataka Chalanachitra Karmikara Kalavidara Tantrajnara Okkuta, said that workers and technicians are accepting the demonetised currency as they can deposit them in banks till December 31. He refuted the allegation that some people are using this opportunity to get rid of their black money. “The payments are small, ranging from Rs. 650 to Rs. 2,000 per day. Many unions affiliated to Okkuta have taken the initiative to open accounts for their members after demonetisation. Acceptance of old currency might continue till December 25,” he said. Channaveerappa, secretary of the Okkuta, said that some producers have started offering Rs. 2,000 notes. “Use of old currency is reducing. But, we don’t know what is in store for us after the year ends,” he said. According to sources in the industry, production of films has been hit. Currently, about 20 films are being shot in Karnataka, including films in other languages. It is the smaller productions that are badly hit. Demonetisation has also affected the exhibition sector. K.V. Chandrashekar, proprietor of Veeresh on Magadi Road, one of the oldest cinemas in the city, said, “The situation is grim. The paucity of currency is keeping the middle class and working class audience away from theatres.” Thomas D’Souza, another exhibitor, said that of the 14 films released after November 8, only Mummy could run beyond a week. “The situation is no different for Telugu films,” Mr. Chandrashekar added. Sa. Ra. Govindu, president, KFCC, argued that even if theatres use swipe machines, a large section of the Kannada audience does not have cards to swipe.

Eyewitnesses said some members in the crowd threw stones at the shutters of a closed ATM and damaged a car. A large crowd was waiting at the bank on Ambur-Sathgar High Road in Pernambut. The customers were upset when the bank staff disbursed only Rs. 2,000 a person although the weekly withdrawal limit was Rs. 24,000. “As tanneries are closed on Friday, many persons had gathered at the bank to withdraw cash. The queue was moving very slowly and they were given only Rs. 2,000. Only one of the three ATMs of the bank was disbursing cash and this too has been closed for nearly three weeks now,” the eyewitness said. Irked by this, the customers staged a road roko on the high road. Some of them threw stones at the shutter of the closed ATM and damaged a car parked at the bank, he added. Officials of the Revenue and Police departments rushed to the spot to pacify the protesters.

1038,2016-12-16,39.0,"Spin and win, or why demonetisation is like the IPL","It took a while, but the counterfeit penny finally dropped. Demonetisation is like the IPL, and not just for the two obvious reasons: their architects who share a name, and the number of spinners in each. If we finish with the same amount of money in circulation as we started with, the scheme is a failure, says an economist. No, says the party spokesman giving it a spin, that means the scheme is a success. Demonetisation (hereafter to be affectionately called ‘demone’ to save space and breath), like the IPL, involves enormous amounts of money, has seen rules made and changed on the fly, shifted goalposts with ease, found loud drum-beaters, and led to predictable corruption. One architect was called ‘Moses’, known for parting the seas, while the other is credited with seizing the parts. If IPL is ‘cricketainment’, demone might have been ‘ecotainment’ except for the current suffering and anticipated future suffering. As the chaos increased, the government’s spinners said changes in rules showed the authorities were sensitive to the sentiments of the people. The IPL showed it was sensitive to the sentiments of the people by taking the tournament to South Africa. Already there is no talk of terrorism or counterfeiting in the demone narrative, just as within days, the IPL’s stated purpose of bringing the cricketing world together was jettisoned. Harbhajan Singh slapping Sreeshanth ended that spin. And then there are the figures being bandied about. Fourteen and a half lakh crores, 50 days, two lakh ATMs, 80 percent of goal, 0.01 percent drop in GDP. In the IPL, the figures are 4.13 billion dollars, 3.67 billion dollars. The Australian writer Gideon Haigh called it ‘asset valuation plucked from thin air’. Demone spinners pluck figures from thin air too, pronouncing the scheme a success rather in the manner of declaring a student passed for the mere act of sitting down to write an exam. If you didn’t agree with one Modi, you were anti-cricket, anti-growth and anti-innovation. If you don’t agree with the other, you are anti-national, corrupt and your mother is a foreigner. Both demone and the IPL changed shape regularly as those in charge – the RBI and the BCCI respectively – abdicated responsibility in the hope of raking in the money with a Michael Jackson-like devotion to black or white. Regulations changed faster than the notes in one case. In the other, notes helped change the regulations. Bank limits are increased or decreased, wedding allowances are changed, deadlines are shifted, exemptions are granted and ungranted. Indelible inks come and go. In the IPL, retention of players was added on, players were banned for trying to do what the IPL was doing, viz. make money, fresh breaks were introduced in the television coverage, conflicts of interest were explained away. The one difference between the two is that while the queues for the IPL comprise smiling faces, those at banks don’t. The players laugh all the way to the bank; the citizens cry all the way away from the bank.

1041,2016-12-16,39.0,Constitution Bench to hear pleas against demonetisation,"A long queue at an ATM at Connaught Place in New Delhi on Thursday.  
| Photo Credit: Sushil Kumar Verma The Supreme Court on Friday ordered the formation of a five-judge Constitution Bench to test the constitutionality of the November 8, 2016 demonetisation notification and the legality of the implementation of the policy. The court, however, refrained from providing any drastic interim relief to the public in terms of banks not honouring the notified Rs. 24,000 withdrawal limit or extending the exemptions granted to the public’s use of demonetised notes for essential services and institutions like railway ticketing and payments at government hospitals and pharmacies. Instead, the Supreme Court said it trusted the government to be the best judge of its own economic and fiscal policies. The court placed its faith in the government’s assurances that the policy was triggered to weed out black money, counterfeit currency and choke terror funding. The three-judge Bench, led by Chief Justice of India T.S. Thakur, noted that “no other directions is possible at this stage” and expressed its belief that the government would do the right thing at the right time to alleviate the sufferings of the public due to demonetisation. The Bench, also comprising Justices A.M. Khanwilkar and D.Y. Chandrachud, stayed the pending proceedings instituted against the government's demonetisation policy in various High Courts across the country. Acting on the government’s plea that they should all be transferred to the apex court, the Bench ordered the proceedings to be withdrawn from the other High Courts and transfer it to the Constitution Bench to avoid “multiplicity of litigation”. It then issued notice to all the petitioners in the High Courts. The Supreme Court addressed each one of the three immediate relief sought by the petitioners in the court, starting with the allegation of discrimination and freeze on withdrawals and deposits in district central co-operative banks (DCCBs). Here, the court accepted the government's assurance that Rs. 8,000 crore collected by the DCCBs between November 11 and 14 would be allowed to be deposited with the RBI and enter currency circulation after a “100 per cent audit” of KYC of the sources of money is conducted. The government said this amount would then be replaced with the new currency and distributed back to the 367 DCCBs as per rules uniformly applied to all banks post demonetisation. The court refused to extend exemption, stating it was “best left to the Government of India”, which it trusted to take a “responsive and sensitive” attitude to the needs of people. On honouring its notification keeping Rs. 24,000 as withdrawal limit, the court referred to the government’s submissions that Rs. 5 lakh crore, that is, 40 per cent of the demonetised notes had been replaced and the authorities were working “to the best” of their abilities. The court asked the government to fulfil its commitment to allow withdrawal of up to Rs. 24,000 “to the extent possible” and review the decision periodically. The Constitution Bench has to look into a batch of following questions: 1. Whether the RBI notification of November 8, 2016 is ultra vires Section 26 (2) and other relevant provisions of the RBI Act, 1954? 2. Whether the notification is violative of Article 300A (right to property) of the Constitution? 3. Whether the notification is ultra vires Articles 14 and 19 of the Constitution? 4. Whether limited withdrawal of one’s own money caused by demonetisation is a violation of Articles 14, 19, 20 and 21 of the Constitution? 5. Whether the implementation of the notification is in substantive and procedural violation of the law of the land? 6. Whether Section 26(2) of the RBI Act is itself a piece of excessive delegation of legislative powers? 7. What is the scope of judicial review into a fiscal and economic policy of the government? 8. Can political parties file writ petitions in the Supreme Court under Article 32 of the Constitution? 9. Were the DCCBs subjected to discrimination when they were stopped from accepting deposits and allowing withdrawals? The Supreme Court said the issue of demonetisation is of public importance and has far-reaching consequence, requiring a Constitution Bench to hear the petitions challenging the policy. Admitting their writ petitions, the court issued them notice returnable in six weeks and rejoinder to be filed by the government and the RBI in the subsequent three weeks.

1042,2016-12-16,39.0,Demonetisation is a visionary step by Modi: Amit Shah," BJP president Amit Shah exhorted his team of national office bearers of the party to campaign for a “less cash” economy and said that demonetisation was a “visionary” step by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, one that not “merely looks good” but “did what was good” for the people of the country. Mr. Shah was addressing a closed door meeting of party office bearers in New Delhi. “Demonetisation is a visionary decision of political will aimed at curbing black money and corruption. The parties criticising it are doing so out of political malice. But the mandate we have received is not for taking decisions which merely look good to people but which are good for them. We will not remain confined to small reforms but bring about fundamental changes in the economy,"" Mr. Shah reportedly said, according to a senior office bearer present at the meeting. A senior party leader quoted Mr. Shah as saying that it is “imperative to kill parallel economy running on black money to boost the country's resources so that it can invest heavily in education, health and other sectors.” Mr. Shah’s comments to office bearers comes a day after he held a meeting of 36 party MPs from eastern Uttar Pradesh, a crucial state that goes into polls early next year. According to MPs present at the meeting, feedback on the decision and implementation to demonetise had also been sought from them. Out of these 36 MPs, around 24 spoke at the meeting, according to a source and the general sense that was conveyed to the party chief was that while the decision and its initial impact had been positively received by the people of the area, the situation entering the third week of December was disappointing. “The lines before banks are not ending and that is creating difficulties for people, especially in the semi rural and rural areas. The surgical strikes against Pakistan had created a positive atmosphere for the party and so had the early days of demonetisation. The remonetisation process needs to be calibrated,” was the message conveyed to Mr. Shah, a senior MP said. BJP National secretary Shrikant Sharma, who spoke to the media after Thursday’s meeting said that the office-bearers, which included state in-charges, also shared ground feedback on demonetisation.

1043,2016-12-16,39.0,FIR filed in currency seizure cases from Capital,": The seizure of large amounts of notes, both old and new, from the Capital have finally resulted in four FIRs being registered against the accused persons, the police said on Thursday. A total of Rs. 17.66 crore, including about Rs. 3 crore in new notes, have been seized by the Delhi Police’s crime branch since demonetisation was announced. However, neither were any arrests made, nor any FIRs registered in connection with any of the incidents. However, Ravindra Yadav, Joint CP (Crime), said the police has now booked the accused for cheating, criminal conspiracy and disobedience to an order by a public servant. The officer clarified that arrests would be made only after the Income Tax Department completed its probe. Big haul The biggest of these seizures was made from T&T Law Firm in south Delhi. The crime branch had raided several alleged hideouts of the company to recover around Rs.13.5 crore. Of the total cash, around Rs.2.60 crore was in new notes, the police claimed. Rohit Tandon, the owner of the firm, however, had allegedly denied that the money belonged to black racketeers. The next raid was at a hotel in Karol Bagh, from where five men were held with Rs.3.25 crore, all in old notes. The money belonged to an alleged hawala operator and the men carrying it claimed to be specialists in packaging business. Trick The men had allegedly used special tapes and wires to pack the notes, allowing them to pass undetected through X-ray machines at airports, the police claimed. The third seizure, of Rs. 64 lakh, was made from one Sukhbir Shokeen, a real estate agent. The police said over Rs.11 lakh of the cash was in Rs.2,000 notes. The fourth seizure was of Rs. 27 lakh from a man at the Hazrat Nizamuddin railway station around three weeks ago.

1044,2016-12-16,39.0,"Demonetisation not a solution to problem of black money, says Prabhat Patnaik","Hyderabad: “Is demonetisation a way of resolving the problem of black money? No. There is no such thing as a black money. It is a black economy that we are dealing with and it cannot be stamped out by demonetisation,” said former Jawaharlal Nehru University professor Prabhat Patnaik speaking at Hyderabad Collective’s meeting on Demonetisation at the Sundarayya Vignana Kendra on Thursday. Using statistics and information about GDP, amount of cash in circulation, ratio of money in the regular economy and cash-only black economy, Mr. Patnaik said: “Black economy will go on. It will not be crippled. It is a fundamental error if we think it will be hurt due to demonetisation. The money used in the black economy is not stuffed in pillows and beds like what is shown in Hindi movies. Someone not paying taxes employs a peon, security guard and a driver and pays them in cash just like someone paying taxes.” Mr Patnaik sounded a dire note with the words that the demonetisation will cause permanent impoverishment. “There is going to be a permanent damage to the economy as the informal sector, which contributes 47 per cent of the GDP, will be affected in the long run in a cashless economy,” said Mr. Patnaik. R. Ramakumar of Tata Institute of Social Studies took aim at the argument about demonetisation weeding out counterfeit currency. “The fake currency by RBI’s own calculation was a miniscule Rs. 400 crore. Unfortunately, the banking system has been so overwhelmed due to demonetisation that there were no checks on the money coming back into the system. This has actually helped legalise fake currency,” observed Mr. Ramakumar.

| Photo Credit: Atish Pomburfekar Escalating his attack on Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi on Saturday trashed demonetisation of high value currency notes as a “Modi-made disaster” and charged that he had attacked the economic system of the country to benefit the one per cent “super rich.” “For the first time in the history of India, Prime Minister has attacked the poor people of this country. Usually the Prime Minister works for the country. They work for the economy, but Narendra Modi has attacked our economic system,” Mr. Gandhi alleged at a Congress rally here in north Karnataka. “As it is said a man-made disaster, in the same way demonetisation is Modi-made disaster,” Mr. Gandhi said as he targeted the Prime Minister squarely blaming him for the hardships post-demonetisation. More than 100 people had died, he claimed, adding, “Fidel Castro (Cuban revolutionary) was remembered in the Parliament and we stood in silence for two minutes as a mark of respect to him, but BJP leaders did not have two minutes time for these hundred people.” “Who is responsible for their deaths? Narendra Modi is responsible....In the last two and half years Narendra Modi government has been attacking the poor,” he said. Accusing the Modi government of trying to divide India, he said on the one side, there were one per cent super rich who have private aircraft, flashy vehicles and big businesses and on the other, there were 99 per cent of people who are honest like farmers, labourers, small traders and middle class who toil every day for the sake of the country and their lives. “In the last two and half years, one per cent super rich in this country have amassed 70 per cent of India’s wealth and if you look deep into this one per cent, only 50 families have major portion of India’s wealth.” “You know their names; these are the people who travel with Narendra Modi to America, Japan, and Australia,” Mr. Gandhi said. “Congress wants to get rid of corruption from India and whatever step the BJP government takes whether it is big or small if it is against corruption we will give it full support,” he said. Asserting that demonetisation was not against the rich but against the poor, middle class, farmers, labourers and small traders, Mr. Gandhi said “all black money is not cash, and all cash is not black money.” “Who has black money, it is with those 50 families, and it is with one per cent super rich in this country..,” he said. “...All the black money is not in cash, India’s thieves are clever, and as soon as they get money they invest it in land, real estate, gold or in foreign bank accounts like Swiss bank.” According to government figures, he said six per cent of black money is in cash, 94 per cent in real estate, big buildings and in foreign bank accounts. Claiming that the Swiss government had given a list of Swiss bank account holders’ names to Indian government, he said the Congress had been asking the government to table the names of “these thieves” in the Parliament for the last two and half years.”Why is it not being tabled? Why is Modi protecting them?” “Why are Lalit Modi and Vijay Mallya sitting in London? Why are they not in India? Why didn’t you get them back? “Vijay Mallya is India’s thief. After demonetisation why did you waive Rs 1200 crore loan of this man? Answer me why did you feed him a toffee of Rs 1200 crore?” Mr. Gandhi said Mr. Modi knows that most part of black money is in Swiss bank, real estate and in huge buildings, “but I don’t know for what reason instead of going after 94 per cent black money, he is after the six per cent. Instead of going after one per cent super rich he is behind 99 per cent.” “He is not after thieves, but behind poor farmers, labourers,” Mr. Gandhi said.

1046,2016-12-17,40.0,?Why not a demonetisation-like attack on manual scavenging??,"“The Prime Minister, on November 8 at 8 p.m., announced demonetisation and said that from midnight higher denomination notes will no longer be valid. If Narendra Modi is really committed to Swachh Bharat, why can’t he make a similar announcement saying manual scavenging will stop from midnight?,” Bezwada Wilson, recent Ramon Magsasay award winner and leading activist of the Safai Karamchari movement, said today. “When we met parliamentarians, they had one question: If you people don’t do it, then how will it be cleaned? That has been the attitude of our political rulers which has ensured that the system still stays,” Mr. Wilson said at the Bangalore Literature Fest. “Mr. Modi often speaks of Swachh Bharat, but what we need to cleanse is our collective psyche which has allowed the inhuman practice of manual scavenging,” he said adding that issues like smart cities served only as a diversion tactic, when none of our cities had a full drainage coverage. “Indian Railways is one of the biggest employers of manual scavengers. Since 2003 the implementation of ecotoilets in 1.76 lakh train coaches has been slogging. The Railway Minister year on year shamelessly announces that this year 500 coaches will be converted,” he rued. “The internalisation of caste has gone so deep that when I question my people why they are doing this humiliating job, they just say they were doing their job. How can it be the job of human beings to clean the excreta of other humans?,” he lamented, adding that he was moved to tears when the Magsasay award was announced in July this year. “Even today 1.6 lakh dalit women are cleaning human excreta everyday, earning a maximum of Rs. 600 a month. How can we celebrate?” Mr. Wilson made stinging comments on the recent Supreme Court ruling on the national anthem in film theatres. “As a society we need to move away from such nationalism,” he said.

In a way, President Nicolas Maduro did a Narendra Modi in his country demonetising the 100-bolivar bills, arguing that the measure was needed to combat mafias on the Colombia border despite warnings from some economists that it risked sparking chaos.

REUTERS Protests and looting broke out in parts of Venezuela on Friday due to a lack of cash after the socialist government suddenly pulled the nation’s largest banknote from circulation in the midst of a brutal economic crisis. An opposition legislator said there were three deaths amid violent scenes in the southern mining town of Callao — but there was no confirmation of that from the government. Agitators curse Maduro Waving the now-worthless 100-bolivar bills, pockets of demonstrators blocked roads, demanded that stores accept the cash, and cursed President Nicolas Maduro in a string of towns and cities around Venezuela, witnesses said. Dozens of shops were looted in various places. Last weekend, Mr. Maduro gave Venezuelans three days to ditch the 100-bolivar bills, arguing that the measure was needed to combat mafias on the Colombia border despite warnings from some economists that it risked sparking chaos. Clamour for his removal Opposition leaders said the move was further evidence he is destroying the OPEC nation’s economy and must be removed. Authorities have thwarted a referendum sought by the opposition against the leftist leader. That might enable him to complete a six-year term ending in early 2019, but increases the prospect of social unrest. With new bills — originally due on Thursday — still nowhere to be seen, many Venezuelans were unable to fill their vehicles’ fuel tanks to get to work, buy food or purchase Christmas gifts. Adding to the chaos, many cash machines were broken or empty. And large lines formed outside the central bank offices in Caracas and Maracaibo where the 100-bolivar bills could still be handed over and deposited for a few days more. ‘This is a mockery’ “This is a mockery,” said bus driver Richard Montilva as he and several hundred others blocked a street outside a bank in the town of El Pinal in Tachira state near Colombia. First Justice lawmaker Angel Medina said large numbers of shops had been ransacked, destroyed and burned in El Callao, with three people killed and many injured. Reuters could not independently confirm his statements. Speaking in general terms, Mr. Maduro condemned the violence around the country, and said two banks had been attacked by people linked to the opposition coalition. He said the new bills would come into circulation soon, appealed for the population’s “comprehension,” and urged Venezuelans to use electronic transactions where possible. 40 p.c. of them have no bank a/cs About 40 per cent of Venezuelans do not have bank accounts. Outside the central bank in Caracas, thousands of Venezuelans lined up to swap the 100-bolivar bills before a final Tuesday deadline as National Guard soldiers kept watch. An orange and avocado vendor offered to buy the notes up for 80 bolivars each. Mr. Maduro’s measure has stoked anger among Venezuelans already weary of long lines for food and medicine amid product shortages and triple-digit inflation. He blamed the crisis on an “economic war” waged against his government to weaken the bolivar currency and unseat him.

He however was sad for the common man who has felt the pinch of the cash crunch the most. “I haven’t faced any problems due to demonetisation as I don’t have back money at all. I pay taxes. Those who have black money will face problems. I make use of card be it debit or credit card whenever we buy something,” Aamir said at an event in Mumbai on Friday evening. “I know common people are facing problem and I feel sad about it. Our Prime Minister has taken a good initiative and we must support him,” he said. The government is encouraging people to switch to a digital regime and go cashless to rein in corruption. On a question to whether going cashless will help, Aamir replied, “I am not an economist. If someone is doing some good work we should help them. I am into films… I can talk about that and not economy.” On work front, the 51-year-old will be seen next as wrestler Mahavir Singh Phogat in “Dangal”.

1049,2016-12-17,40.0,Demonetisation narrative,"  While switching over to the digital mode in terms of financial transactions is welcome, it is unfortunate that the government is now trying to cash in on people’s weaknesses by announcing periodical lucky dips worth crores in order to promote digital payments (“Digital payments made after November 8 can prove lucky”, Dec.16). Instead, such amounts can be spent imparting digital education to the needy. For the success of any programme, a government should rely on awareness and work culture of people rather than misleading them by promising them a fortune or a windfall. Today’s sufferings on account of demonetisation could have been averted had the government well thought out its plan. Kshirasagara Balaji Rao, Hyderabad Demonetisation has been harsh on the elderly. We are allowed to draw a maximum of Rs.24,000 a week but on any day we can draw a maximum of Rs.10,000 only from the savings bank account. This condition makes me to go to the bank on all its working days, but it never works out as there is a huge crowd or the bank soon runs out of money. Thus my ‘attendance’ at a bank is 100 per cent. If there are notes, it is usually Rs.2,000 which proves cumbersome as far as street vendors are concerned. One can imagine the plight of senior citizens in villages. N. Subramanian, Chennai To deal with cashless transactions, 90 crore bank accounts will have to be opened along with a credit card facility which can be integrated with all types of swipe machines. The software has to be good in order to prevent hacking and misutilisation. Machines should also be able to take on the very high capacity of transactions and servers need to be robust. The government has to facilitate use of cards at any time, anywhere, and for limitless transactions without any transaction commission. Different types of taxes on purchases must be phased out. There must be discounts on payments to essential services. Vasantal Visweswara Rao, Vizianagaram, Andhra Pradesh The government seems to have finally realised that a cashless economy is actually a less-cash economy, as no economy can be fully cashless (“Digital transactions not a fill-in for cash: Jaitley”, Dec.16). This now raises a question as to what percentage of the economy can be made cashless. For most developed countries, it is between 85 and 95 per cent. Two basic requirements to achieve a high percentage of electronic transactions are the educational level of people and foolproof infrastructure such as 24- hour electricity supply, mobile phone and Internet connectivity across India. The government needs to think of realistic schemes and proceed stage-wise. J. Fredric Dawson, Chennai The difficulties of moving to a cashless economy hit me recently. Buying a piece of furniture from a local shop shocked us the moment we offered to pay by debit card. The owner inflated the price by Rs.2,300, explaining it as the sum the bank charges for transactions using cards. Obviously this was a disingenuous excuse and I wonder what more is in store for us. Aastha Sharma, Chandigarh To argue that demonetisation was a pre-planned, two-stage exercise where the “cashless” concept was deliberately withheld initially so as to pre-empt the resistance that a forced transition would evoke is to take a dim view of readers’ intelligence (“Why ‘cashless’ may be the new normal”, Dec.14). The article has also gone overboard in also claiming that it is “the only way”. I would like to focus on the sentence, “the change to the cashless concept can be brought about through extreme political pressure”. Does this imply that the travails millions of citizens are undergoing through forced multiple visits to banks to access their own money, not to mention workers in the informal sector facing lay-offs that could last weeks or months, are all just part of political pressure deliberately applied to force them to accept the new normal? S.K.N. Nair, Thiruvananthapuram Instead of harping on the long-term benefits of demonetisation, the government must realise the serious consequences of a long-drawn-out cash crunch and resultant hardships. The best the government can do to smooth ruffled feelings is to issue a clear statement on its intent to replace the entire demonetised currency in a specific time frame. This step alone will result in lesser cash draws. Aiming for a lower cash to GDP ratio is a lofty goal but it must be remembered that Japan has a cash to GDP ratio of around 20 per cent and that several developed European countries have a ratio of 9 per cent which is much higher than the global average. Steps to promote electronic payments must take into account ground realities. Valluri Janaki Ram, Hyderabad The government’s over-optimistic aim of becoming a cashless economy has to be proportionate with the infrastructure at disposal. Digital payment technology has to penetrate every nook and corner of the country. In his exclusive article to The Hindu (“Making of a mammoth tragedy”, Dec.9), former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh mentioned that “more than 600 million Indians still live in a town or village with no bank”. Despite an active drive to tap unbanked areas since 2001, there are still huge gaps. Sahil Bhatia, Jaipur Southern Railway, in association with State Bank of India, has installed point of sale machines at computerised reservation counters in major railway stations across the zone to enable the passengers to use debit/credit cards for ticket bookings. Passengers are saved the risk of carrying liquid cash and change and railway and staff are able to finish work faster. I recommend promotion of such cashless transactions in all service sectors. C.S. Ananthakrishnan, Srirangam, Tamil Nadu The government’s reply to the Supreme Court (“Why do some get new notes, but not others, asks SC”, Dec.16) “that it cannot sit and keep watch in every bank branch in the country” amounts to shedding its responsibility. Most banks now dispense soiled Rs.10, Rs.20 and Rs.50 notes. The new Rs.500 note has yet to reach rural areas. Small traders and grocers are now refusing to accept cards and most citizens are suffering. As the lessons learnt after cyclone Vardah show, there must be space for transactions with physical currency. C.A.C.

Yet, no developer is openly admitting about the slump in prices of open sites/houses/residential and commercial flats. They continue to quote the earlier prices in the hope that the cash flow would improve soon. But, they admit that many buyers are not coming forward to invest in real estate for being accounted for their transactions. Prices in the real estate sector have crashed drastically, says a prominent developer. For instance, the price for a 30ft x 40ft housing site, which was sold for nearly Rs. 34 lakh to Rs.35 lakh til recently, has gone down to Rs.24 lakh now. A latest research study conducted jointly by the Belagavi chapter of the Confederation of Real Estate Developers’ Associations of India and the Institute of Management Education & Research on residential projects that were completed last year and those under construction provides information about the status of the real estate sector in the city. As per the report made available to the media, 110 residential apartment projects were surveyed. As many as 2,245 residential units were completed last year. Incomplete projects since 2015 are expected to be completed by 2018-end. As many as 1,525 units are under construction of which 698 flats had been booked which account for about 46 per cent of the total number. As many as 720 flats were completed as on June this year of which 41 per cent have remained unsold. “We have not slashed the prices although the buyers are offering 20 per cent to 30 per cent less than our quoted price,” a developer told The Hindu here on Wednesday. However, developers are looking forward to banks cutting down home loan rates from 2017-18 in the wake of the money being deposited in banks following demonetisation. They expect that it will prompt many to buy houses.

1052,2016-12-17,40.0,"Not a crime to exchange currency, say police","HYDERABAD: In a little more than a month post demonetisation, about a dozen incidents of money exchanges have been reported in the city. While cases were registered when people were robbed during such exchanges, police officials are handing over seized cash to the Income Tax Department, as it is not a crime to exchange currency. In the most recent instance, a man lodged a complaint with the Chikkadpally police stating that two bike-borne persons stole Rs. 61 lakh in new Rs. 2,000 notes when he had gone to exchange it with another party. Similar incidents have also been reported from the Rachakonda and Cyberabad police limits, wherein people were trying to exchange huge amounts of cash. “Prima facie it seems like the banks are in connivance with middlemen who are making money due to the situation. If a man is exchanging money for some commission and both the parties agree to it, then the police cannot do anything, as it is not illegal,” said a senior police official, unwilling to be identified. Unless someone comes forward and complains, the police will not know about such incidents, the official added. Another senior police official said that a cheating case under Section 420 of the IPC can be registered against people holding huge amounts in the new currency. “But even that might not be maintainable. Only the I-T Department can check and identify the source,” he said. Officials also pointed out that even in cases wherein people were robbed of money, they do not give exact information about its source. For example, Rs. 58 lakh in Rs. 2,000 and Rs. 100 notes were stolen from a businessman named Divesh Agarwal when he attempted to exchange it with demonetised currency at a 25 per cent commission on December 5. Mr. Agarwal told the South Zone police, which recovered more than Rs. 50 lakh, that he had got the notes through intermediaries from rural areas. “He apparently did it through some 50 middlemen, who then got the money from several villagers. But that does not seem like a plausible explanation,” the police official pointed out. Cyberabad Commissioner Sandeep Shandilya said that so far Rs. 1.4 crore in Rs. 2,000 notes have been seized under different police stations limits under his jurisdiction. “Section 420 of the IPC can be applied in such cases. The question is where people are getting such huge amounts from. We are acting only when we have concrete information (about exchanges),” he added.

1053,2016-12-17,40.0,Demonetisation: Revenue of transport wing dips by 4 p.c.,"The revenue of the Transport Department has come down by 4 per cent, due to demonetisation. Speaking to mediapersons on Friday, Transport Minister Sidda Raghava Rao said to enable cashless transactions, the department had introduced 160 swipe machines in the offices of the Regional Transport Officers in the State. He said people were unable to buy vehicles owing to cash crunch and thus the dwindling income of the department. The Minister said tenders would be called for construction of an international driving school at Darsi in Prakasam district at an estimated cost of Rs. 21 crore. Modern test tracks would be set up in Vijayawada and Visakhapatnam, and construction of RTO offices at Gajuwaka, Hindupur and Parvathipuram were nearing completion. Road safety Speaking about road safety, he said a meeting to discuss the issue would take place in Tirupati in the first week of January. Mr. Raghava Rao said the road proposed to be constructed between Anantapur and Amaravati at an estimated cost of Rs. 27,000 crore would reduce the travel time between the two destinations to eight hours. He said the government would spend Rs. 2,000 crore to acquire the land required for the project. He said the AP State Road Transport Corporation had incurred a loss of Rs. 45 crore as on December 14 on account of demonetisation. The Corporation had placed order for 16,000 e-PoS machines. He said swipe machines had come as a great relief for cashless transactions in the wake of severe cash crunch.

1054,2016-12-17,40.0,"Post-demonetisation, land transactions plummet","The real estate sector has taken a hit in Kozhikode since Prime Minister Narendra Modi declared that Rs.500 and Rs.1,000 notes were no longer legal tender. Post-demonetisation, real estate agents say land transactions have come down as buyers and sellers both employ hard currency. “Besides, the weekly withdrawal restriction of Rs.24,000 has made people wary of the progress of the business. Only genuine buyers and property owners who are desperate to sell or buy land are entering into deals, ” C.P. Yahu, a real estate agent, said. At the same time, land rates have become cheaper in many parts of the city. Previously, re-sellers as well as buyers had been insisting on cash in the payment of real estate transactions. But now, that mode of payment has drastically come down. Already, the real estate sector has been experiencing a lull after the State government enacted the Kerala Real Estate (Regulation and Development) Act and the Parliament legislated the Benami Transactions (Prohibition) Amendment Act. “Perhaps the correction could last four to six months, ” he says. Land rates Previously, land rates on the stretch from Mavoor Road Junction to Pottammal Junction were between Rs.30 lakh and Rs.50 lakh per cent; on the Mini Bypass, Rs.10 lakh to Rs.15 lakh; and on the Malaparamba-Thondayad (Kozhikode Bypass), Rs.35 lakh to Rs.40 lakh. Now, these rates have come down. The demonetisation impact is also seen in residential areas at Civil Station, Malaparamba, Cheverambalam, Kottooli, West Hill, Karaparamba, Karikkamkulam, Puthiyangadi, Pavangad, Govindapuram and Panniyankara. Documentations carried out at the Registration Department in Kozhikode have slowed. “The district had 6,500 documentations, including land registration, power of attorney and mortgage certification, a day earlier. Now, the figure has plummeted to 90 a day, ” an official said. The impact of the cash crunch has also resulted in several investors deciding not to honour the token amount paid to the buyer and thus backtracking from land deals. “Many fear both the buyer and seller have to go through legal formalities in land agreements and that now a rule has come that all benami properties would be confiscated by the government, ” K. Sivadasan, a real estate investor said.

| Photo Credit: G_RAMAKRISHNA Hyderabad: Former chairman of the Law Commission Justice B.P. Jeevan Reddy has expressed hope that the Central Government will soon come out with prompt measures to provide relief to the scores of people suffering due to the demonetisation of higher denomination currency notes. The decision, he said, was “ill conceived” as it was not preceded by proper preparation by the Government and it imposed enormous burden on the banking sector. “Ever since demonetisation was declared by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, there is a sharp division of opinion on its correctness or otherwise,” he said. He was speaking at the inaugural of the All India Bank Officers’ Association Seventh Conference here on Sunday. Given the fact that rural India was 100 per cent cash-based economy, the Government should have reckoned with factors like illiteracy before asking them to convert into digital economy overnight. While there were long queues outside the banks, it was “shameful and unfortunate” that large bundles of the new notes were finding their way into the hands of “those people who are sought to be hit” by the exercise. “Where is the leakage? Is it with the printing presses, RBI or banks?” he questioned. Loan approvals Justice Jeevan Reddy stressed the need for evolving a strong mechanism to regulate advancing of loans for avoiding the accumulating non-performance assets of the banks. “A system should be evolved to regulate loans to persons notoriously evil and undesirable. Who is held responsible when the loan ends in default?” he asked. CPI general secretary Suravaram Sudhakar Reddy said the “unwise” decision had resulted in issuance of new notifications changing the older ones every day ever since the demonetisation exercise was kick started. The political situation in the country was marked by attacks on freedom of expression and universities to some extent and the rightist nationalism was increasing ethnic and class battles across the country. The decision to change into digital transactions came at a time when more than 25 per cent of the population was illiterate and only 40 per cent of the literates had functional knowledge of moving into digital era. “Leaders who lacked courage to criticise the Prime Minister are casting aspersions on the banks,” he said apprehending that banks could become targets of the public ire in the coming days.

Venkaiah Naidu on Sunday said that the apprehensions among the people would have been cleared had the opposition parties allowed a meaningful debate in Parliament. “The Opposition has made a mockery of democracy in Parliament by scuttling the government’s attempts to put things in perspective,” he observed. Addressing the media on the sidelines of a paediatric cardiac medical camp conducted at Swarna Bharat Trust here on Sunday, Mr. Naidu pointed out that the Prime Minister’s decision to withdraw Rs.1,000 and Rs.500 notes out of circulation was welcomed by the people. “The problems caused by demonetisation are temporary. It will do a world of good to the economy in the long run,” he said, and sought the cooperation of States for promoting digital transactions. The Union Minister further said that a large number of people who rarely paid taxes started paying the statutory dues as demonetisation and the regulatory measures that followed closed all possible escape routes for them. Earlier, inaugurating the medical camp organised by the Healing Little Hearts Foundation, the U.K., Mr. Naidu said that efforts were being made to make healthcare in government hospitals affordable for the common people.

  Bucking the trend of deferred product introductions in the wake of the withdrawal of high-denomination banknotes, jewellery and watch retailer Titan Company Ltd. has brought the ‘Favre Leuba’ Swiss watch brand to India. Response for the vintage brand’s products, with prices pegged between Rs.1.6 lakh and Rs.3.8 lakh, has been good so far, according to the company. “We have received very good feedback for the collection and the brand recall is heartening to note, especially in the Indian market,” Thomas Morf, CEO, Favre-Leuba, said in e-mailed comments. “Favre-Leuba was re-presented in Japan market on October 6.... India followed next ... We will soon be having the brand’s presence in Dubai, Taiwan and then Hong Kong between December 2016 and January 2017. The initial market reception has been excellent across Japan as well as India,” Mr. Morf said. Favre Leuba AG (FLAG) was incorporated in 2012 by Titan as a subsidiary. The brand is being revived in a contemporary form that retains its heritage while making it relevant for today’s global connoisseur, the company said. Oldest brand It is among the world’s oldest watch brands. The first (pocket) watch was manufactured by Favre Leuba in 1718 and the brand was registered as a trademark in 1737. It has had a continuous involvement with eight generations of the family associated with the company, making it among the most renowned family-owned brands in the Swiss watch industry, according to the FLAG website. Ladies’ line Mr. Morf said that while the ladies’ line would be unveiled in three months’ time, the line up for men had been introduced featuring 21 designs. The project (to redesign products) started two years ago, he added. S. Ravi Kant, Titan’s CEO, watches and accessories, said the company’s premium watches priced in the range of Rs.5,000 and above were outpacing other categories with growth at about 12 per cent. “When it comes to demonetisation, we had the highest impact in the first week across retail and other channels. However, retail has more or less bounced back to normal now,” he said. Sajid Ismail, horologist and owner of a century-old retail watch outlet in the city’s business district, said although Favre Leuba was not in the league of a Rolex, or an Omega, or a Patek Phillipe, it was still a vintage brand, with the watches popular among collectors. “We still get four to five such watches for repairs every month and the response after the relaunch is not surprising,” Mr. Ismail said.

The event — Theatre of Demonetisation — saw a lively debate among participants at the Bangalore Literature Festival. While some branded it the “Dara Singh of Economics”, others likened it to “shock therapy”. Social scientist Shiv Visvanathan, who took a critical stand on the issue, called it a “B-grade Bollywood film.” “It’s already a stretch that people have started remembering the days of socialism and long queues in front of ration shops. But now ATMs deliver even less,” he said. Economist author Sanjeev Sanyal passionately batted for the move calling it a “shock therapy” with Prime Minister Narendra Modi essentially trying to lead the country into a new normal, shirking off the old inertia and effecting a behaviour change. He was booed by the audience when he questioned the deaths of people standing in queues. “They may have died in football stadium queues or even railway queues,” he said, which did not go down well with the audience. Economist Narendra Pani said the constant shift in narrative from black money to cashless society clearly showed that the script writer was not in control. “The move clearly shows a lack of empathy and understanding on various affected sections. Informal economies have suffered a setback. In India, we may move towards a cashless economy, but that does not mean banking or digital. There are many alternative systems, including barter, that have already evolved in the rural areas,” he argued. On liberalism Another session drew on the political landscape in a world after the victory of Donald Trump and Brexit. Is it time for liberals to reinvent their narrative? Senior editor Mini Menon made a passionate case for a rethink. “Liberalism, that has fought many wars, has today become elitist and caught in ivory towers. They (liberals) are no longer talking about jobs and are unable to produce a credible counter narrative,” she said, speaking at a session on “Culture Wars: Left Right and Twitter.” Author Manu S. Pillai cited the matrilineal society of Kerala that lies in a shambles today. “Even in 1940s, our society was matrilineal and in 1920s women never covered their upper torso. But we now think the present values existed for all times,” he argued, adding that jobs alone cannot solve issues. Not all were sceptical. Aakar Patel, executive director, Amnesty International India, was optimistic. “Liberalism has won most of the wars in the last 100 years, from voting rights to women to civil rights movements to all individual freedoms. But liberalism is boring while right-wing is exciting.

He also announced a massive protest against demonetisation with like-minded regional and national parties in Patna in the New Year. “Notebandi ka wahi haal hoga jo Congress ka nasbandi ka hua tha Emergency ke samay [demonetisation will meet the same fate as forced sterilisation by Congress party during the Emergency],” Mr. Prasad said while addressing party MPs, MLAs and workers at 10 Circular Road, the official residence of his wife, Rabri Devi. The meeting was held to discuss strategies to protest demonetisation. “It is not notebandi but farzibandi [fraud] that has affected common people in the country…the Prime Minister has cheated people,” Mr. Prasad said. Rural awareness The RJD chief further said his party would launch an awareness programme in villages on the impact of demonetisation and explain that it had nothing to do with the poor or the economy of the country. “On December 28, our party will organise a dharna at the district headquarters on the issue of demonetisation all across the state,” he said while adding that once the deadline of December 30 given by the Prime Minister is past, the party will discuss the situation with like-minded regional parties, including the alliance partner Janata Dal (United) and national parties to hold a mammoth rally in Patna. Recalling Mr. Modi’s poll promise of retrieving black money from banks overseas and depositing Rs. 15 lakh in every citizen’s bank account, Mr. Prasad said: “We’ll not sit idle as this Prime Minister changes his words very often.” Unlike the JD(U), the RJD chief has been opposing demonetisation since beginning. When asked, he also said that “it is unfortunate West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee, Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal and Bihar CM Nitish Kumar are not together on the issue of demonetisation.” Deputy Chief Minister Tejaswi Yadav, younger son of Mr. Prasad, said: “The country has not been benefited through demonetisation in any way.” Senior RJD leaders Raghuvansh Prasad Singh and Jagdanand Singh too attacked the Union government on the issue, and appealed to party workers to “expose the BJP and its nefarious design.” Earlier, Mr. Raghuvansh Prasad Singh had said the Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar’s support to demonetisation had sent a wrong signal on the unity of the grand alliance government in the State.

Though nothing concrete has come up so far, sources said that the CBI was working along with the Income Tax department to know if the persons, who were caught in the activity, got cash in new currency notes from banks. About a dozen cases of money exchanges, with some being more than Rs.50 lakh, have been reported in Hyderabad since the demonetisation of the Rs.500 and Rs.1,000 notes. Sources revealed that CBI has asked the IT department to verify the serial numbers of the Rs.2,000 currency notes that have been seized in money exchange cases registered by the city police. “The notes, that have been checked so far by the IT department, were all jumbled and not in any particular serial order,” added the source. Since demonetisation, the investigative agency has also been receiving many complaints as well from the public through emails, post and telephone. But most of them have not pinpointed at any particular person , stated the source. “There is a possibility that some people may have collected new notes in huge amounts through intermediaries. Money exchange cases involving huge amounts of cash are being checked for the source of the notes,” said the source.  Postal scam The CBI has recovered about Rs.40 lakh more in Rs.2,000 notes in the postal money exchange scam, wherein a senior official had exchanged Rs.4 crore of the new notes with demonetised currency notes. About Rs.80 lakh was with K. Sudheer Babu, Superintendent of Post Offices, Hyderabad city division, who masterminded the scam. The remaining Rs.70 lakh was recovered from other private individuals and other postal department officials who were also involved in the money exchange scam. Sudheer Babu had done the exchange through the Himayathnagar, Karwan, Golconda and the Parishram Bhavan post offices with the aid of other department officials who have also been arrested and booked by the CBI.

It had also recovered Rs.11 crore in cash and Rs.4.2 crore worth of bullion, announced Chief Commissioner of IT-Hyd Sushil Kumar and Director General (Investigations) Nina Nigam here on Monday. The department has also traced Rs.2,000 crore of unaccounted for wealth in both States. “We have all the information of how much black money has made into the bank accounts and how much has gone from there. The department is very active. We know how to deal with it,” asserted Mr. Kumar at a press conference.

Reuters Pakistan’s Senate on Monday passed a resolution seeking withdrawal of high denomination Rs. 5,000 currency notes “in a phased manner” to curb the flow of black money, weeks after India demonetised its high value currencies. Senator Usman Saif Ullah Khan of Pakistan Muslim League tabled the resolution that was endorsed by the majority of lawmakers in the Upper House. The resolution said that the withdrawal of Rs. 5,000 notes will encourage the use of bank accounts and reduce the size of the undocumented economy, Dawn reported. It said the withdrawal of the currency notes should take place within three to five years in order to purge markets of the notes. Law Minister Zahid Hamid, however, said that the withdrawal of the notes will create crises in the market and the people will resort to foreign currencies in absence of Rs. 5,000 notes. He said that currently 3.4 trillion notes are in circulation in country of which 1.02 trillion notes are of Rs. 5,000 denominations. The move appears to be inspired by India’s recent demonetisation drive, in which notes of 500 and 1,000 Indian rupees were pulled from circulation.

| Photo Credit: V. Sreenivasa Murthy The RBI on Monday has issued fresh guidelines on depositing demonetised high value currency notes of Rs. 1000 and Rs. 500. Here is what you need to know: What is the new rule from RBI? The Reserve Bank of India on Monday announced that deposits of more than Rs. 5,000 of demonetised currency note will be allowed only once, till December 30. So if you have Rs.10,000 with you in Rs.1000 or Rs.500 notes, you will have to take it to the bank in one go. After that, you will not be able to make any more deposits of demonetised notes till December 30. Does this mean I cannot deposit more than once? If you have less than Rs. 5,000 in demonetised notes in your hand, you can spread it over any number of deposits. Are there any new procedures for depositing more than Rs. 5,000 in demonetised notes? You will have to present your case of why you didn't deposit them earlier, in the presence of at least two bank officials. If the officials find your response satisfactory, it will be accepted. But your bank account may be scrutinisied later at the time of audit. What if I deposited Rs. 4,000 and later found two more Rs. 1000 notes? If the combined values of your deposits exceeds Rs. 5000, you will be subjected to the same procedure as when depositing more than Rs.5,000 once. And you will not be able to make any more deposits of demonetised till Dec.30 after that. But how will a bank know if I have deposited Rs. 4,000 earlier elsewhere? Every time you deposit demonetised money, the bank alerts the CBS (core banking solution). If you deposit Rs. 4,000 as old notes today , you can deposit only Rs.1,000 more in old notes without being asked to give an explanation. What is this KYC compliance clause? The one-time deposits of over Rs. 5,000 can be made only to KYC-compliant accounts. KYC, or Know your customer, is a business process to verify the identity of bank customers. Banks collect a valid identification proof and address proof and PAN card details of its customers periodically. Those who haven't submitted these documents are KYC-non compliant. Such customers can deposit only up to Rs. 50,000 in demonetised notes. I don't have time to visit a bank. Can I send someone on my behalf? Yes, you can. You have to provide suitable authorisation to the bank and the person depositing the amount should show approved identification. You still have to send a written explanation as to why you didn't make the deposit earlier. I have more than Rs. 5,000 in cash. But they are not demonetised currency notes... There is no restriction on currency notes that are legal tender. I have unaccounted money worth more than Rs. 5,000 and I am planning to disclose it under the new declaration scheme. What should I do now? These restrictions do not apply to deposits made under the government’s new income declaration scheme, the Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Yojana 2016. You have to deposit 25 per cent of total declared unaccounted money to the Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Yojana, a scheme with a four-year lock in period with no interest. I lost track of all rules related to demonetised money. A quick recap please. Government has demonetised Rs. 1000 and Rs. 500 currency notes with effect from November 8 midnight. Though the government had earlier made some exemptions, these notes have ceased to be legal tender and are not being accepted anywhere from December 15. If you still have them, they can be deposited in your accounts in nationalised and private-sector banks till December 30. After that, the Reserve Bank will continue to accept these notes directly till March end after getting a declaration.

But, unfortunately, the Ministry had not taken adequate steps, said Bharatiya Janata Party leader and Rajya Sabha MP Subramanian Swamy at Coimbatore International Airport on Sunday. Queues outside banks He told reporters that the Finance Ministry thought demonetisation would never take place. But, the Prime Minister suddenly announced it, probably under the impression that the Ministry must have made the preparations, he said in response to a question on the common man standing in queues outside banks and ATMs for currency notes. But, he was not implying that the Finance Minister Arun Jaitley was not in the know of the demonetisation decision. It was the job of the Ministry to be prepared and if it was not, it should have told the Prime Minister, he said. The demonetisation move was decided two years ago soon after the 2014 election. He had headed a committee on this issue and one of the two decisions was demonetisation and abolition of income tax, he added. The Congress was responsible for disrupting the just-concluded Winter Session for the Parliament. “Why did not the Congress or the other Opposition parties agree to the discussion. Congress vice president Rahul Gandhi said he had earth-shattering information on Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s corruption. He did not offer any further information after he was told that any information in the nature of evidence should not be suppressed and passed on to the investigating agency. The only information that was known was that the Congress leader lacked political acumen,” Mr. Swamy said. Mr. Swamy said that he did not have any information of foul play or suspicion in the death of former Chief Minister Jayalalithaa. In the absence of any evidence, he could not comment on the issue, he said. He also dismissed reports that he was to be made the governor of Tamil Nadu. “I did not accept,” he said and refused to elaborate further.

STRINGER With protests rocking his unpopular government, embattled President Nicolas Maduro delayed until January 2 taking Venezuela’s highest denomination bill out of circulation. The 100-bolivar bills would temporarily remain legal tender, Mr. Maduro said on Saturday, but the borders with Colombia and Brazil will remain closed to hit what he claims are “mafias” hoarding Venezuelan cash abroad in a U.S.-backed plot to destabilise the country. 77% of cash “You can calmly continue to use the 100 bill for your purchases and your activities,” Mr. Maduro said at a meeting with officials broadcast on state television. The bill is worth about 15 U.S. cents at the highest official rate, and until recently accounted for 77 per cent of the cash in circulation in Venezuela. Venezuela has the world’s highest inflation rate, set to hit 475 per cent this year according to the International Monetary Fund (IMF). The government is trying to introduce new bills in denominations up to 200 times higher than the old ones, but the plan derailed when Mr. Maduro banned the 100-bolivar note before the new bills arrived. Four airplanes with the new currency set to arrive from abroad were delayed by international sabotage, Mr. Maduro said. He did not say where the money was coming from, or what type of sabotage. Venezuelans stood in long lines at banks all week to meet a Friday deadline to exchange their currency. When the deadline extension was announced people queued up again on Saturday. In a country with one of the highest rates of violent crime in the world, shoppers must carry unwieldy wads of bills to pay for their purchases. Retirees had complained for months that their pensions were paid in unmanageable 50- and 20-bolivar denominations. Rioting and angry protests erupted in several Venezuelan cities as the chaotic reform left people without cash to buy food or Christmas presents. Opposition politicians said on Saturday that four people were killed in rioting in the capital of the southern State of Bolivar, though officials have not confirmed those figures. Unrest however was such that the Ciudad Bolivar Mayor ordered a curfew banning “motorcycles, pedestrians and private vehicles” until late Monday. The pro-Maduro state Governor, Francisco Rangel Gomez, said on Twitter that 135 people were arrested for looting, and that soldiers were deployed “to re-establish order”. In Guasdalito, in the central-western State of Apure, three state bank offices were torched, an incident Mr. Maduro late Friday blamed on unnamed Opposition politicians. — AFP Printable version | Jan 7, 2017 1:46:46 AM | http://www.thehindu.com/news/international/Amid-unrest-riots-and-lootingMaduro-delays-demonetisation/article16901701.ece © The Hindu In March, at the annual conference of the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC) Mr. Trump had promised to shift the embassy to Jerusalem.

1067,2016-12-19,42.0,Demonetisation thus far,"With most concessions and exemptions as far as trade in old notes having ended on December 15, things appear to be going from bad to worse despite the Reserve Bank of India’s claim of there being a fair amount of liquidity. There are still serpentine queues outside ATMs. This is because ATMs are either closed from evening on certain days or are running out of money in no time. With reports coming in of huge seizures of new denomination notes across the country, the common man is fast losing hope and there seems to be no end in sight to his ordeal. There are no concessions in the distribution of new notes for the salaried class despite it paying taxes through its nose and constituting over 50 per cent of the base of IT assessees. Nearly 80 per cent of debit cardholders use cards only for withdrawal of cash. The RBI must issue daily bulletins on how much liquidity there is. S. Srinivasan, Chennai A disturbing feature which has surfaced ever since demonetisation is the increasing number of financial malpractices unearthed between bank staff and wrong-doers. That this is happening across the country is serious. This is also creating deep mistrust of the banking system. Gone are the days when a banker was regarded as a friend, philosopher and guide and who possessed a high degree of integrity. An uncompromising work culture and impeccable ethical conduct for banks are the need of the hour. S.R.S. Ayyar, Mumbai Venezuela’s experience as far as demonetisation is concerned should serve as an eye-opener for the Indian government as it still works on testing the endurance levels of Indians instead of working towards a goal of remonetisation. All political parties must take note of the immense suffering being caused to the common man. Abinash Singh, Patiala, Punjab Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s remark that demonetisation and cashless transactions will make the country corruption-free is never going to work. The remark is bound to make people uncomfortable as it is said that each electronic transaction will result in a user bearing an additional service tax of Rs.25 depending on whether it is under National Electronic Fund Transfer or Real Time Gross Settlement. It is also estimated that only 2 per cent of the population is truly interested in a cashless economy despite innumerable advertisements that are attempting to promote it. Mr Modi needs to understand the country’s needs and wishes. His comment is insensitive. K.A. Solaman, Alappuzha, Kerala In a written reply to the Lok Sabha, Union Finance Minister Arun Jaitley has said: “There is no official estimation of the amount of black money either before or after the government’s decision of November 8.” Does this not amount to backtracking on the issue and also fooling us? He should realise that public memory is not that short as to forget the various statements and promises made by his party and the government right from 2014, at different forums, including the Supreme Court. If what Mr. Jaitley now says is the truth, how could the Prime Minister and some others in his government go on repeating that demonetisation is primarily intended to end black money? This is as bad as the official half-truths on ‘ending the cash crunch’. P.R.V. Raja, Pandalam, Kerala If what Mr. Jaitley has said is true, how could the Prime Minister make such a vital decision regarding demonetisation without an idea of the extent of black money? In order to punish a negligible percentage of the population which has eaten into the vitals of governance, the government has chosen to inconvenience the majority. G.M. Rama Rao, Visakhapatnam For me, the most disturbing aspect in the demonetisation saga so far has been the stand and attitude of the judiciary. Fine, it cannot question the basic move as such. But is it not aware of how this move has severely disrupted several livelihoods. People have died under the stress of waiting in queues? Whatever be its motives or compulsions, the government has no business disturbing our lives in normal conditions. There is no war, famine, epidemic or nation-wide natural calamity to impose monetary curbs. Are these measures not violative of minimum constitutional guarantees? Why is the judiciary not taking suo motu recognition of such issues and subjecting the government to some relentless questioning? Where would people go to but the court when the government is hardening its stand with each passing day? M. Balakrishnan, Bangalore Prime Minister Narendra Modi has cited extracts from a book by former bureaucrat Madhav Godbole to buttress his claim about Indira Gandhi being forced to baulk at demonetisation on electoral compulsions (“For Congress, party is above country: Modi”, Dec.17). There is no reason to disbelieve Mr. Godbole’s account, given his outstanding credentials as a civil servant. At the same time, it also shows that Mrs. Gandhi, unlike the present BJP leadership, was honest enough in admitting the role of black money in contesting elections, though a very sad commentary on the ethics, morality and purity of our electoral process. Does Mr. Modi like the nation to believe that no black money was used in his party’s mega-campaign in the 2014 Lok Sabha election, given the fact that a major chunk of any party’s funds are from unknown sources? Other parties are of course no better in this regard. S.K.

1069,2016-12-20,43.0,Ginger growers feel the heat of demonetisation,"Farm workers loading ginger rhizomes from a farm at Thareekkara in Chikmagaluru district in Karnataka.   Poor demand and low price for ginger rhizomes in the market after the demonetisation drive, apart from low production owing to climate change, have put Keralite ginger growers who cultivate ginger in Wayanad district and various parts of Karnataka in a fix. “The cash crunch following the demonetisation is a major reason for the crisis as there is no demand for the produce,” says Mohan Navrang, secretary, Kerala Ginger Growers’ Association. The price of the produce was Rs.950-Rs.1,000 a bag (a bag contains 62 kg of the produce) on Tuesday in the Karnataka market as against Rs.2,100 a bag during the corresponding period last year. The price declined to Rs.900 a bag (62 kg a bag) in the Wayanad market. This year, close to 20,000 growers have cultivated the crop in 60,000 hectares of rented land, mainly in Karnataka. “Usually we get an average yield of 750 to 1,000 bags (60 kg a bag) from a hectare, but this year it shrank to 300 to 500 bags owing to dearth of monsoon showers. The cost of production is nearly Rs.4.5 lakh for an acre. In the present situation, the growers cannot recoup half of the investment,” Mr. Mohanan, who is cultivating ginger in nearly 10 hectares of rented land at Thareekkara, Chikmagalur, Karnataka, said. “Growers who delay the harvest of ginger also face the loss, as rhizomes become dry and lose weight,” he said. Growers fear that the present crisis will affect the cultivation of the crop next season as well as preparation for next cultivation should begin by the middle of January and they need cash to prepare land, purchase seeds, and pay the advance of the lease amount. The association submitted a memorandum to the Prime Minister and the Union Agriculture Minister seeking their intervention in the issue on a war footing. The organisation would take out a march at Sulthan Bathery at 10 a.m. on Thursday in protest against the ‘anti-farmer’ policies of the Central government.

They also demanded a CBI inquiry into the cases of seizure of huge number of new currency with some persons when bank branches are cash starved. The unions demanded compensation to the families of the persons and bank staff who lost their lives recently due to demonetisation. They asked the RBI and State governments to ensure safety and protection of bank employees and officers by maintaining law and order in all branches to prevent harassment of the staff.

Speaking to reporters here on Monday, VCK leader Thol. Thirumavalavan alleged that demonetisation was a clear violation of the constitutional provisions. He said Prime Minister Narendra Modi was not ready to give clarification to the opposition on the floor of the House. This was a deliberate attempt to disrupt the proceedings, he said. The party will be holding a conference in Puducherry on December 28 to bring to focus the constitutional violation and the need for statutory protection for the people following demonetisation. The VCK has invited leaders of the CPI (M) and CPI, constituents of the People’s Welfare Front (PWF) for the conference. However, MDMK general secretary Vaiko has not been invited as he is supporting the demonetisation move. Mr. Thirumavalavan also called upon the Centre to declare Tamil Nadu as a drought-affected State since monsoon had failed.

1072,2016-12-20,43.0,?Demonetisation has hit farm workers?,"K.K. Shylaja, Health and Social Welfare Minister of Kerala, speaking at the State conference of the All-India Agricultural Workers’ Union at Kundapur in Udupi district on Monday.
  K.K. Shylaja, Health and Social Welfare Minister of Kerala, said on Monday that demonetisation of currency in the Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,000 denomination has hit the farm workers hard. She was here to inaugurate the three-day State conference of the All-India Agricultural Workers Union. Ms. Shylaja said that the farm workers had lost even the limited and scanty work they used to get due to the Union government’s decision. The present season was important for agriculture sector. In some areas, harvesting was taking place, while in others, it was the beginning of cultivation. But instead of being in fields, the farm workers were standing in queues before banks and ATMs for getting their petty deposits encashed or to exchange their soiled notes. The Centre had gone for demonetisation without making adequate and alternative arrangements to ensure financial liquidity, she said. Having failed in the currency ban exercise, Prime Minister Narendra Modi was now speaking of cashless economy. In a country where transactions were primarily cash based, it was impossible to implement cashless transactions in rural areas. Cashless transactions required high rates of literacy, internet connectivity, wide banking network and other infrastructure facilities, which were lacking in villages. She said that she was worried about the spread of the divisive ideologies of religious fundamentalists, who were organising workers on the basis of religion, caste, creed, etc, and thereby disrupting the unity among them. This tendency had become prominent in the country and it was having a serious impact on its social fabric. “Hence, the contemporary responsibilities of the working class are two pronged. One, fight for economic emancipation and, two, defeat the communal and caste divisiveness in society. These responsibilities are inseparable, one cannot be achieved without fulfilling the other,” she said. The society was passing through a difficult period. Socially backward castes, especially Dalits, were subjected to even physical attacks for the jobs they were doing and the food they were eating, Ms. Shylaja said. S. Thirunavakkarasu, A. Vijayraghavan, G.N. Nagaraj, Nithyananda Swami, Chandrappa Hoskera, Venkatesh Koni, union leaders, and G.V. Sriram Reddy, K. Shankar, and Balakrishna Shetty, CPI(M) leaders, were present.

The duo, identified as Nitin Jain (32) and Arvind Jain (34), both residents of Khadakpada, are suspected of running a currency notes exchange racket in Thane district, and the police have informed the Income Tax Department about the matter. The action was taken based on a tip-off received by the Khadakpada police, according to which some men on a scooter would be coming to Adharwadi circle with a large number of new currency notes to exchange for old ones. “The information was conveyed to the Bazarpeth police, and a team was sent to the spot. The team saw two men on a Suzuki Access scooter waiting at the circle. A search of the scooter revealed a bag full of Rs. 2,000 notes, after which the vehicle and the men were taken to the police station,” said an officer with the Thane police. The bag contained 11 bundles of 100 notes, and one bundle of 50 notes, all in Rs. 2,000 denomination. “Investigations revealed that the duo were waiting for some clients who wanted to exchange old notes at a certain exchange rate. We are verifying this information,” the officer said. The Bazarpeth police have recorded a diary entry under Section 102 of the Criminal Procedure Code, which empowers a police officer to seize any property which may be found under circumstances that create the suspicion of the commission of an offence.

Speaking to The Hindu on Monday, Dean of Diplomatic Corps in India, Hans Dannenberg Castellanos, the Ambassador of the Dominican Republic, said that tourist flow to India has reduced since demonetisation was announced on November 8 and the government’s plan continues to prevent diplomats from carrying out duties. “Iranian and Sudanese medical tourists are facing trouble due to demonetisation as they mostly do not have bank cards due to sanctions on their countries. Similar is the case with the Cubans and Afghans who are complaining about the currency exchange limit,” said Mr. Castellanos, elaborating that the tourists who chose India months ago as their winter destination have been cancelling travel plans. Mr. Castellanos, as the Dean of the Diplomatic Corps first approached the government on November 11 complaining about the hardships that demonetisation imposed on foreign diplomatic missions and on foreigners visiting India. On December 8, he met Foreign Secretary S. Jaishankar and was assured that the government would give “highest consideration” to the problems faced by the diplomats. In his letter to the External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj, the Dean highlighted the plight of medical tourists and students who had arrived in India before the new financial restrictions were placed and were finding it impossible to exchange them for new notes. “While a lot of us are trying to adjust to the restrictions after demonetisation but several embassies that are undergoing construction need additional cash as they are facing difficulties in paying workers,” he said.

1075,2016-12-20,43.0,A saree for a rupee to ?celebrate demonetisation?,"RUPEE RUSH: Crowds queue up to get the one-rupee saree in Bidar on Monday.   A small cloth shop owner in Bidar, Karnataka is promoting demonetisation with his own prize scheme: for two days since Sunday he has sold sarees at a rupee each, the only condition being that the payment has to be made with a Re.1 note. No coins. “Demonetisation is all about notes,” says the trader, whose shop is in the heart of the town, near the hospital. The one-rupee saree offer spread like a summer fire and his shop was virtually swamped on Monday morning, sparking fears of a stampede. The police arrived just in time and controlled the crowd. The saree scheme is the brainchild of Chandrashekar Pasarge, who owns Srishti Drishti Saree Centre. He claims to have sold 3,000 sarees on Sunday before more people heard about the offer and made a beeline for the shop. The sarees are acquired from Hyderabad. The self-styled entrepreneur swears that he will continue with the deal till he sells one lakh sarees. Are one rupee notes easy to get? No, but the crowds at the shop had the currency. Jayavanti Suryakanth, a school teacher points out that many people keep Re. 1 notes in prayer rooms as part of their offering.  Hundred to one Each saree is claimed to cost around Rs. 100, but Mr. Pasarge says he does not worry about losses. “This is more of a gift than a sale,” he adds. A board outside the shop says the offer is to celebrate ‘Christmas, New Year and demonetisation.’ Proceeds will go to the temple of Sri Anantha Shayana in Shamrajpura Agrahara near Bidar. Mr. Pasarge asserts that he does not fully understand “the complex economics” behind demonetisation, but believes the move will do everyone good. His daughter Dristhi says the idea for the saree sale came from her grandmother. “I told my father to give away a saree a rupee for all, poor or rich.” The queue at the shop is made up mostly of women, though there are some men. Rehana Bi, who works as a maid, says she skipped work on Monday to buy a saree. Her husband is an auto rickshaw driver. But it is not just the less affluent who are here. Ms. Suryakanth, a school teacher, said, “My neighbour told me about it and we came here together.” She is sceptical about the quality of the cloth, though.

1076,2016-12-20,43.0,?Demonetisation will slow down growth for 10 months?,"“Demonetisation will slow down growth for 10 months. But it will lead to positive results after that. India will become an economic super power in two to three years,” S. Vishwanath Bhat, convener of the BJP’s economic cell has said. Addressing a workshop for party workers, businessmen, lawyers, bankers and homemakers here on Monday, he said that the government’s plan was well thought out, but the people would be forced to suffer for the coming eight to 10 months as its implementation entailed some issues. “We should realise that this is the kind of sacrifice we should be making for ensuring a corruption free, terror free and black- money free India. If we don’t suffer through this short period, the coming generations will find fault with us,” Mr. Bhat said. The former banker said that the economy of the country had suffered so badly that Prime Minister Narendra Modi had no option other than banning high-value notes. “We have to realise this before forming opinions shared on social media platforms like WhatsApp,” he said. Mr. Bhat compared the suffering owing to demonetisation with the pain of child birth. “People from the poor and middle classes and rich have all suffered in this. We still continue to suffer. But then, this is the kind of pain we are wiling to suffer. Once the baby is out, we will be smiling like proud mothers,” the editor of the party’s economic newsletter said. He found fault with some regional leaders who were opposing demonetisation as they were colluding with vested interests. “West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerji, for example, is opposing it as demonetisation has stopped the flow of money to her party that was being supplied by the fake currency lobby in that State,” Mr. Bhat said. Narendra Nayak, co-convener of the economic cell, urged party workers to spread awareness about demonetisation. “First of all, we should all resolve to reduce our cash based transactions to 60 per cent of present levels. We should motivate more people to open bank accounts and get debit cards. We should also go to banks and motivate more people to become banking correspondents,” Mr. Nayak said. Bhagwant Khuba, MP, said some MPs had criticised the plan in a meeting held by BJP president Amit Shah. But then Mr. Shah told us to realise that this was done for political reasons. “Mr. Modi can win elections just by going around making speeches, Mr Shah told us. But, he was implementing demonetisation to make India a great country. Mr. Shah and asked us support the initiative,” Mr. Khuba said. He lamented that some bankers were bringing a bad name to the whole process by their dishonest deeds. Amaresh. K, convenor of the IT cell State unit, and Jagadish Biradar and Nitin Karpur, district unit conveners, were present.

The farmers in the sowing season are not able to buy seeds or fertilisers. The Telangana Government by supporting demonetisation has furthered the poor plight of the farmers. Agriculture crisis in the State has aggravated so much that 2,554 farmers have committed suicide after the formation of Telangana. Demonetisation worsened the situation and there are tonnes of produce lying unsold. “Farmers are making less money than they invested and this is affecting their livelihood. The number of farmer suicides is very high in Telangana even in comparison to Bihar and Uttar Pradesh,” said Justice B Chadrakumar, president of the Vedika. With the Legislative Assembly in session, legislators should solve invest time in solving this crisis that threatens to end Telangana’s well-being, he added. From fake seeds to fake fertilisers, farmers are being subjected to different woes and TRS Telangana Rashtra Samithi government has done nothing to prevent them. “The government should bring out a seed policy and save farmers. Seeds which yield no produce are flooding the market and the State has failed to do anything substantial,” convener of the Vedika P L Visweswara Rao said. The Vedika members also stressed on the need for better educational facilities in the State. “Government is planning to privatise education by favouring Reliance. Why shouldn’t the government support its own institutions over the private ones? Old universities like Osmania University will die a natural death because of policies of the TRS,” Mr. Rao said. Already the number of teachers in OU have shrunk to 400 permanent staff, he said. The Vedika also attacked GO 123 issued for land acquisition. Land acquisition should be done systematically.

AP The Reserve Bank of India on Wednesday rolled back the restriction it imposed on people seeking to deposit Rs. 5,000 or more of the scrapped Rs. 1,000 and old Rs. 500 notes with immediate effect. The rollback, applicable to accounts compliant with KYC (Know Your Customer), came just two days after the central bank notified the rule. On Monday, the RBI said deposits exceeding Rs. 5,000 in a bank account would be “received for credit only once during the remaining period till December 30, 2016. The credit in such cases shall be afforded only after questioning tenderer, on record, in the presence of at least two officials of the bank, as to why this could not be deposited earlier and receiving a satisfactory explanation.” On Wednesday, it said that “on a review,” banks were advised that the restrictions would not apply to accounts compliant KYC. For accounts not compliant with KYC, it limited deposits of withdrawn banknotes to Rs. 50,000. Monday’s circular, which also directed banks to preserve the customer’s explanation to facilitate an audit trail at a later stage, triggered a furore over the sudden decision to restrict the return of the withdrawn currency almost 10 days prior to the originally announced deadline of December 30. Finance Minister Arun Jaitley on Tuesday clarified that those depositing the demonetised currency for the first time would face no questioning from bank officials. Besides Opposition politicians, the All India Bank Officers’ Convention panned the rule. The bank officers sought revocation of the December 19 notification, citing high amounts of stress it was causing to bank officials and the physical harm they were being placed under. The Prime Minister’s November 8 announcement on the withdrawal of legal tender status for the old Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,000 notes specified December 30 as the deadline for deposit of the notes.

1080,2016-12-21,44.0,Demonetisation hits students hard,"In the education hub of Coimbatore where thousands of students from other cities study, demonetisation of Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,000 notes seems to have hit the normal life of the students. The students say they normally have Rs. 3,000 to Rs. 5,000 a month in the bank account and carry less than Rs. 1,000 as cash. They withdraw money from the ATM when there is a need. Those residing in rented houses pay the monthly rent by cash, while those in hostels (run by the institutions or private players) are able to transfer the rent amount from their account. However, what has hit these students more is shortage of cash for daily needs such as food, travel, and study materials. “Those who were preparing for their semester examinations were unable to stand in the long queues to withdraw money,” says a third-year physics students from Erode, who is studying here. Further, though an institution normally has two or three ATMs, cash is not available in most of these. Many of them have reduced their spending, especially in eating out with friends. The neighbourhood grocery stores do not accept cards and hence, they are unable to buy provisions to cook at home too. Prabhu, who was in Coimbatore and is studying at Sastra University, said those living in rented houses had a difficult time as they had to go in search of an ATM, were unable to withdraw cash, and were unable to eat out because they did not have enough money. Sangeetha, a computer science student, says that a day after the semester exams the college in which she is studying in the city asked the students to vacate the hostel. She had just Rs. 1,500 with her in the bank account and could not withdraw money from the ATM. She needed money to travel home and most of the banks were dispensing Rs. 2,000 notes. With the help of another student, she borrowed money and went home. In the recent days, the situation seems to be getting better as banks do not insist on passbook and allow students to withdraw money without it.

1081,2016-12-21,44.0,"Demonetisation shadow over rescue, relief efforts",": The cash crunch caused by demonetisation has affected rescue and relief operations in many parts of Chennai, which are urgently required after Cyclone Vardah uprooted trees and damaged civic infrastructure. Cash disbursement had fallen owing to demonetisation. However, rescue and relief operations were not affected until Monday as the Treasury has been disbursing cash for works implemented by various departments. But on Tuesday, the Treasury of the Greater Chennai Corporation stopped the disbursement of cash to provide for contingencies. Disbursement of cash plays a key role in rescue and relief operations after any disaster as the provisions of the Transparency in Tenders Act cannot be adopted during such challenging times as a disaster. Civic officials who visited Ripon Building on Tuesday with proposals for various works, including rescue and relief operations, returned empty-handed as the Treasury did not have cash. Cash is given to officials of the civic body across the table to cope with the crisis. Officials in many zones were even unable to give cash of Rs. 100 towards daily contingency expenses for staff who are clearing uprooted trees. Owing to the shortage of cash, workers from other municipalities, who are part of relief teams, may not get the promised Rs. 2,000 incentive after the completion of relief and rescue work, officials said. At least Rs. 2 crore in cash is required every day for rescue and relief operations in the city, they added. No alternative Alternatives such as cheque transactions were explored but receiving cash through the bank accounts of lower level officials, including the Junior Engineer, was also challenging, sources said. “The government is yet to make any special arrangement through the Reserve Bank of India to provide cash during the crisis,” a senior official pointed out. The Greater Chennai Corporation maintains accounts in ten different banks, including the Karur Vysya Bank, ICICI Bank, HDFC Bank, Canara Bank and the Punjab National Bank. “Some of the officials who received cash from the treasury before Monday used it to carry out rescue and relief operations on Tuesday,” said an official. Owing to the cash crunch, the supply of food for workers from other municipalities is also expected to be affected this week, he notes. Due to the cyclone, spending on food, bleaching powder, medical camps by the Health Department, solid waste management and fuel for vehicles is expected to increase, officials indicated.

Mr. Jaitley hinted at some more “out of the box” steps that the government would take to ease the adverse impact of demonetisation. The bankers, during a pre-Budget consultative meeting with Mr. Jaitley, suggested special efforts for digitisation of primary agriculture cooperative societies, regional rural banks and co-operative banks to promote digital transactions and e-payments. “The Union Finance Minister Arun Jaitley said that the current Financial Year 2016-17 is not a conventional year as many major reformative decisions have been taken during the year,” according to an official statement. “He said that there is need for out-of-box thinking as series of steps are required about what the Government can do and what the banks can do. The Finance Minister further said that the banking sector is the backbone of our economy. He said that he doesn’t see any serious challenges as far as structural changes are concerned.” The bankers said that liquidity in banks has improved post demonetisation, but this could impact saving deposit rates. Senior citizens This makes senior citizens more vulnerable as their income is adversely affected, the bankers said, suggesting that some sort of exemption need to given to them under the Income Tax Act. The bankers also told the finance minister that there is a need for the recapitalisation of banks in the current financial year as well as in the next financial year, adding that there is a need for full tax exemption for NPA provisioning by the banks. After demonetisation, the Budget should focus on boosting consumption to create demand, the bankers said, adding that one way to achieve this was by encouraging low-cost housing by relaxing the rules. At the moment, “the digital acceptance infrastructure is loss-making,” the bankers informed Mr. Jaitley, suggesting that there need to be incentives for this in the Budget. The government representatives apart from Mr. Jaitley included Minister of State for Finance and Corporate Affairs Arjun Ram Meghwal, Finance Secretary Ashok Lavasa, Economic Affairs Secretary Shaktikanta Das, Revenue Secretary Hasmukh Adhia, Financial Services Secretary Anjuli Chib Duggal, DIPAM Secretary Neeraj Kumar Gupta, Chief Economic Adviser Arvind Subramanian, among others.

Justice K.N. Phaneendra passed the order on a petition filed by Chandrakanth Ramalingam, a resident of Bengaluru, while adjourning further hearing till next week. The court asked the counsel of the petitioner to serve a copy of the petition to the CBI’s Special Public Prosecutor. It was disclosed during recent raids conducted by the Income Tax Department that the petitioner was possessing Rs. 46 lakh, all in the denomination of Rs. 2,000. The Special Court for CBI cases had last week denied bail to Mr. Ramalingam and had observed that more details could unravel about the conspiracy in the alleged illegal exchange of new currency notes with the help of officials of some banks as the investigation was under way. However, the petitioner had claimed that provisions of the Prevention of Corruption Act cannot be invoked against him as there was no demand or acceptance of money in the case and also because he was not a public servant. It was also claimed in the petition that he had, under the provisions of Income Tax Act, time till March 31, 2017 to explain the source of Rs. 46 lakh. Pointing out that the High Court, in the case of Ibrahim Sherief, a civil works contractor who too has been arraigned as an accused in the case, had recently asked the CBI not to arrest Mr. Sherief if the latter cooperates with the investigation, the petitioner too sought a direction from the court to extend similar benefit to him.

1086,2016-12-21,44.0,"Hit by demonetisation, tourism industry is banking on year-end respite","First, the unrest over the Cauvery waters sharing dispute and then demonetisation; it has not been a good season for the tourism industry in the State. With the cash crunch disrupting everyday life, travel plans have become a casualty in many cases. With the exam season fast approaching, most players are now pinning their hope on the summer vacations to recover their losses. Many are hoping that the Christmas–New Year holidays will bring in some respite. Karnataka State Tourism Development Corporation (KSTDC), for example, is seeing 40 per cent occupancy even in its prime properties in Kodagu, Mysuru, Srirangapatna, and Hampi. KSTDC Managing Director Kumar Pushkar said properties across the State had seen a drop in occupancy by 30 to 35 per cent in November, post-demonetisation, compared with earlier holiday seasons. “After the dip we saw in September because of the Cauvery issue, bookings have not picked up. After demonetisation, though we have facilities for online payments, tourists still need some cash in hand to get around the places,” he said, explaining why visitors are keeping away. The situation is not as bleak in the private sector, with many operators saying that business has finally started picking up. A lot of the reservations for the year-end were made before demonetisation. Homestays in Kodagu, which are hugely popular options, also experienced a slump in November, though bookings started picking up in December, Madan Somanna, president, Coorg Homestay Association. Usually packed during this time of the year, the lack of alternative modes of payment is posing a problem. “Though most homestay owners are open to bank transfers, there is still apprehension about installing card swiping machines,” said Navin Poonacha from the association, which is also preparing to accept online payments from mid-January through its website. It is not just hotel bookings. M. Ravi of Arjun Tours and Travels Pvt. Ltd. said taxi drivers, for example, were finding it difficult to make transactions with customers between getting paid for their trips and paying entry taxes in the neighbouring States. “Like every other industry, the tourism and travel industry has taken a hit, and business is down by 20 to 25 per cent. However, it is a luxury requirement. So online portals could be seeing an increase in bookings from those who usually travel during Christmas and New Year,” he added. This is already happening, said Aurvind Lama, CEO of Travelyaari, a Bengaluru-based online bus booking platform. “One can see online bookings go up tremendously this December, maybe by 40 to 50 per cent. In fact, offline bookings too could increase by 20 per cent this month as people who had postponed plans earlier are making them happen this month,” he said. Golden Chariot continues to suffer The not-so-golden run of the luxury train Golden Chariot continued well into the holiday season, with even the short-haul trips that the Tourism Department launched during Dasara failing to catch the fancy of tourists. The department finally ran only one of the five trips that were planned. With the slump expected to continue until the summer vacations commence because of the exam season, the Tourism Department is looking at running trips from April to September to make up for the current losses. Restaurants, pubs hit affected Among the other leisure spaces hit by demonetisation are hotels, restaurants and pubs. Owners of such spaces said unlike popular perception, not all their customers were those who swiped cards for payment. “The pubs, for example, were doing around 70 to 80 per cent of business through cards, which has gone up to around 86 per cent post-demonetisation. The remaining 14 per cent, that would have been business through cash payments, is not coming in, which means sales are down,” said Ashish Kothare, head of Bengaluru Chapter and member of the managing committee of the National Restaurant Association of India.

V. Raju Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister N. Chandrababu Naidu, who heads a panel set up by the NDA government to look into issues arising from demonetisation, on Tuesday admitted that there was no solution to the problems even 40 days after the announcement of the move. He said: “Demonetisation is not what we wished for but it happened.” The Telugu Desam Party chief said: “I could solve many crises, including the August crisis [when the TDP was dethroned in a coup in the party in the 80s] in less than a month.

1088,2016-12-21,44.0,Demonetisation ? an unkind postscript,"In November, the Governor of the Reserve Bank of India, Urjit Patel, said there was a ‘confluence of thought’ in the government and the central bank to deal with black money by removing existing Rs.500 and Rs.1,000 notes as legal tender. Now, just about ten days before the deadline to deposit these bank notes into accounts, a similar confluence of ideas has led to a stunning decision to make it harder for people to do so. The new caveats, announced on Monday, restricting deposits over Rs.5,000 (roughly $70) are not just difficult to fathom but also constitute an unfair change in the rules of the game. Those opting to disclose unaccounted income under the new amnesty scheme, the Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Yojana, face no restriction on depositing old notes. But anyone depositing Rs.5,000 or more into a bank account will have to satisfactorily explain to two bank officials why this was not done earlier. However, the Finance Minister has suggested that such explanations will not be required for anyone making a deposit for the first time. Apart from the human tendency to act only when a deadline nears, there could be genuine reasons for people not to have queued up at banks till now — including their faith in the Prime Minister, as well as the Finance Minister’s statements that they had till December 30 to do so. Overstretched bankers may somehow cope with this latest diktat. But implementation is likely to be arbitrary as each bank branch may come up with its own ground rules, just as they are doing in the case of cash withdrawal limits. Nevertheless, tasking them to record and flag for audit purposes deposits amounting to just 1.66 per cent of the personal income tax threshold is tantamount to outsourcing the taxman’s job to the banker for no ostensible revenue pay-off. Initially, the Centre said deposits up to Rs.2.5 lakh would not be questioned, but later held that all deposits could be scrutinised — even though the Income Tax Department will struggle to complete scrutiny of lakhs of accounts within the legally stipulated two-year deadline. The Prime Minister had said exchange limits for old notes would be enhanced from November 25; instead, the exchange facility was stopped altogether. By December 10, Rs.12.44 lakh crore, or 80 per cent of the old notes, was back in the system, and by December 30 most, if not all, could well return. Perhaps spooked by that prospect, the Finance Ministry suggested that double counting may have skewed the numbers, but bankers have dismissed that possibility. The latest flip-flop to make deposits difficult appears to suggest that the government is itself in panic mode over its bold gambit.     Printable version | Jan 7, 2017 1:47:43 AM | http://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/Demonetisation-%E2%80%94-an-unkind-postscript/article16913530.ece © The Hindu Good intentions alone are not enough to secure the public interest.

1089,2016-12-22,45.0,Demonetisation will spike inflation: Economists,"The Parliamentary Standing Committee on Finance met with four top economists of the country on Thursday to note their views on the Union government’s decision to demonetise Rs. 1,000 and Rs. 500 currency notes. Reserve Bank Governor Urjit Patel had informed the committee that he would be meeting them only on January 19. The committee is chaired by former Union Minister M. Veerappa Moily and has former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh as a member. Dr. Singh was present at Thursday’s meeting. Sources in the committee told The Hindu that the majority of the economists who spoke to the committee — Dr. Kavita Rao of the National Institute of Public Finance and Policy (the Finance Ministry’s own think tank), former Chief Statistician to the Government India Dr. Pronab Sen and Dr. Mahesh Vyas with the Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy — were unhappy with the consequences of the decision to demonetise. Dr. Rajiv Kumar, senior fellow with the Centre for Policy Research, argued in favour of the move. Wealth in gold, real estate All the three economists who expressed their concern about demonetisation felt that only a small part of unaccounted money would be stored in cash. Most of it was likely to be invested in real estate and gold. They said the currency reform might actually end up spiking inflation, instead of reducing it. “They also argued that for a meaningful war against black money, the government should denotify a part of the currency every two years,” said a member of the committee. The committee members said that its report on demonetisation would be submitted to Parliament on the first day of the Budget Session, likely to begin in the last week of January. “For that purpose, we will be calling officials from the Finance and the Information Technology ministries on January 12 and RBI governor Urjit Patel and members of the Indian Banking Association (IBA) on January 19,” said the source. They said Prime Minister Narendra Modi would be meeting economists on December 27 on the state of the Indian economy. No more details were forthcoming.

A majority of schools in Karimnagar has sought more time from its staff for payment of salary as they have not collected fee so far. “We are unable to get private finance to give salary to teachers and other staff,” said a school correspondent. The chairman of Vivekananda Vidyanikethan Educational Institutions, S. Komuraiah, said they were urging the parents to pay at least the monthly fee instead of the term fee, but in vain. The situation is worse in residential schools as the managements are struggling to provide quality food to the inmates. Parents aver that they were unable to withdraw adequate cash from banks following the restrictions. “Even when the government informed the banks to give Rs. 24,000 per week to an account holder, the bank gave only Rs. 4,000,” said Venkatesh, a parent. He also said that the private schools were not accepting cheques as they do not have bank accounts. The schools that have bank accounts are only a handful. Those schools that filed income tax returns accepted cheques and have introduced swiping machines for fee collection. The Telangana Recognised Schools Management Association (TRSMA) State general secretary and correspondent of a private school, Y. Shekhar Rao, agreed that most of the schools did not have bank accounts and said they were encouraging them to open bank accounts and file income tax returns to avoid problems related to fee collection.

Officials said the woman, identified as Lissy Sojan, Denis, Binoy, and Jijo, were taken into custody from the premises of Jawaharlal Nehru International Stadium, Kaloor, in the morning. They were released a few hours later after interrogation. Acting on a tip-off, I-T sleuths took the four persons, who had reached the location in two cars, into custody around 12.30 p.m. Even though two of them attempted to escape, they were chased down with the assistance of the local police. Official sources said they had been operating as agents for arranging new currency and had contacted persons who were desperate to exchange the withdrawn currency. Similarly, they also had allegedly contacted persons who provided new currency in bulk. No cases have been registered though a follow-up probe is on. Meanwhile, officials denied reports about the seizure of a cheque for Rs. 1 crore from their possession. The episode unfolded a day after the I-T Department arrested five persons from Tamil Nadu who came to Kochi for exchanging new currencies by accepting withdrawn currencies of Rs. 500 and Rs.1,000 denominations. During the raid, the sleuths seized 41 currency notes of Rs. 2,000 denomination from their possession.

1092,2016-12-22,45.0,Demonetisation hits fee collection in private schools,"Managements of private schools are a worried lot following demonetisation as it impacted payment of salaries to their staff. Due to restriction in withdrawal of funds from bank accounts, many parents had not paid school fee, which had put the managements in a quandary as they were unable to take up maintenance of schools and pay salaries. The salaries to school teachers were paid before the announcement of demonetisation on November 8. Till date, majority of schools have not paid salaries to their teachers due to non-collection of fees from the students. Some corporate schools with a number of branches had paid two months’ advance salaries to their staff with old currency notes in November itself. Majority of the school managements complain that they were unable to run the schools as they were not getting fees from the students in spite of repeated reminders. “We are unable to get private loans also to give salaries to the teaching and non-teaching staff and others following demonetisation. We are unable to pay monthly rentals for school buildings, power bills and clear property taxes”, said a school correspondent (manager) in Karimnagar town. Vivekananda Vidyanikethan educational institutions chairman S Komuraiah said they were pleading with the parents to pay at least monthly fees instead of term fees, but in vain as they do not have adequate cash. The situation is even worse in residential schools as the management was struggling hard to provide quality food to hostellers due to cash crunch and are buying essential commodities and vegetables on credit, he complained. Only a few private schools, who have bank accounts and showing Income Tax returns were accepting cheques and introduced swiping machines for collection of fees. Most of the private schools without bank accounts and do not show IT returns are a worried lot over the collection of fees from parents. Telangana Recognised Schools Management Association (TRSMA) state general secretary and correspondent of a private school Y Shekhar Rao said that private schools are facing crisis due to demonetisation as they were not getting fees in cash.

  Demonetisation did not come in the way of students of Kendriya Vidyalaya, Akkulam, raising an amount of Rs.1.21 lakh for the patients of Government Medical College Hospital here. The money, raised by students as part of the ‘Joy of Giving’ campaign of the Kendriya Vidyalaya Sangathan (KVS), was handed over by school Principal Jose Mathew, teachers, and students of the school charity club to hospital Superintendent Sharmad M.S. in the school Assembly on Wednesday morning. In his address, Dr. Sharmad lauded the students’ efforts to help the needy. He also called on the public and organisations of charity to give more priority to the medical college hospital as it catered to a large number of patients from most disadvantaged sections of society, many of them unable to pay for their food or medicines. Sanjeev Nair of the Department of Pulmonary Medicine of the medical college and E. Shaji, representative of the Parent-Teacher Association, were present on the occasion. Coinciding with the KVS Foundation Day celebrations on December 15, the fund-raising was done by the charity club in a matter of days. “Students, teachers, and staff contributed generously,” the school Principal said. The collection builds upon the club’s efforts in the years past. Last year, the school had handed over Rs.1 lakh to snake-catcher Vava Suresh. The year before, it had contributed Rs.81,000 to Pallium India, and in 2013, Rs.53,000 to the Regional Cancer Centre here. The money will be used for medicines and other needs of patients below the poverty line who are undergoing treatment at the hospital, poor patients without treatment cards and from other States, patients from care homes and Abhaya, and those reduced to penury on account of their illness.

File photo   As the cash crunch bit in further, another big jute mill in West Bengal’s North 24 Paraganas shut down on Tuesday for an indefinite period. The Nadia Jute Mill management said in a notice that it had “failed” to pay electricity bills and the workers’ weekly allowance due to the severe “cash crunch.” “Thus we have no choice but to shut down the mill as the situation slid from bad to worse,” an employee said. The Trinamool Congress-affiliated (INTTUC) union said workers were not paid their bi-weekly salaries on December 10 and the decision to suspend operations was an attempt to deny salaries due on December 25. The union said “while the management claims that disconnection of electricity to the mill is one of the reasons for the closure, workers cannot be held responsible for such issues.” The power supply to the factory was cut early on Tuesday morning forcing the company to shut down the plant. 3,500 workers affected The leader of CITU-led unions, Biplab Ganguly, said about 3,500 employees, both contractual and permanent workers, were left jobless. On Tuesday morning the workers reached the mill to find a “suspension of work” notice at the gate. Ram Pravesh Singh, representing National Union of Jute Workers said the management did not pay salaries to workers on December 10 citing demonetisation impact. He alleged that the closure was “an excuse” to refuse salaries to the workers, but the management denied the charge. Earlier this month Shree Hanuman Jute Mill in Howrah district closed with the management blaming demonetisation, and the absence of currency. This led to “non-cooperation activities” among some workers which “increased day-by-day causing labour unrest and unlawful violence,” the mill officials said explaining their decision to cease normal operations..

Addressing a huge public rally at Ramlila Ground here, Mr. Kejirwal said Mr. Modi had resorted to demonetisation to facilitate the write-off of bad debts amounting to Rs. 1.14 lakh crore, extending the benefit to his industrialist friends, while common people were forced to stand in queues outside banks and ATMs. Mr. Kejriwal, who is also national convenor of the AAAP, took exception to the audit exemption given to political parties on depositing old currency notes. BJP and Congress were receiving 70 to 80 per cent of donations in cash, while AAP got only eight percent of such donations, he said. “Before asking the people to adopt cashless economy, Mr. Modi and his party colleagues should refuse to accept donations in cash,” said Mr. Kejriwal, while demanding a probe into how the political leaders had acquired huge assets. Backs graft charges Mr. Kejriwal, who is searching a new political landscape in Rajasthan, accused the NDA government at the Centre of allowing liquor baron Vijay Mallya to fly abroad and waiving off his loans worth Rs.1,200 crore. Supporting the charges of corruption against Mr. Modi during his tenure as the Gujarat Chief Minister, the AAP leader said the documents obtained in the Income Tax Department's raids had revealed that Birlas and Saharas had paid crores of rupees. However, the probe was kept pending, he added. “If the Modi government is serious about checking corruption, it should order audit of each political party’s bank and cash accounts for the last five years’ duration. The government should also arrest 648 citizens who have their accounts in Swiss banks,” said Mr. Kejriwal. The Delhi Chief Minister affirmed that demonetisation had adversely affected the business of small traders and shopkeepers and brought the farmers to the verge of complete destruction. “I have studied [this] demonetisation concept and reached the conclusion that it has failed to eliminate corruption and black money from the system,” he said.

1098,2016-12-23,46.0,Demonetisation dents revenue collection,"The rising revenue collection in the Union Territory has witnessed a sudden fall in the last one month due to a cash crunch following the ban on higher denomination currencies. The Commercial Tax Department, the key contributor to the coffers of the territorial administration, had recorded a steady rise in revenue collection from the beginning of the current fiscal, but it took a downward spiral in November and it continues to be so this month. The revenue collection nosedived from Rs. 141 crore in October to Rs. 131 crore in November. “The dip in commercial activities post demonetisation have hit the revenue collection very badly. This happened at a time when the collection was showing encouraging signs from April. There was a marginal increase every month from April and it suddenly fell in November. The trend is likely to continue this month,” a senior government official told The Hindu. The Excise Department too witnessed a shortfall in collections in November compared to the previous month. While the department collected a sum of Rs. 52 crore in October, it managed only Rs. 46 crore in November. The concern for the government, according to a senior official, was not the dip in commercial tax and excise duty collections, as it could recover as and when the cash crunch eases. What is worrisome for the government is falling revenue from registration of properties. As the third biggest revenue earner after the Commercial Taxes Department and Excise, the Revenue Department had been facing a slump in stamp duty collection due to fall in registration of properties during the last two financial years. Stamp duty collection Notwithstanding the slump in stamp duty collection, the government in August reduced the guideline registration (GLR) value of property by 25 per cent as a measure to increase the volume of registration. While stamp duty collection was around Rs 7 crore in September-October, the earnings from registration of property came down to around Rs 4 crore post-demonetisation. In the previous two years, the monthly revenue collection from stamp duty was around Rs 10 to Rs 12 crore. The Revenue Department had collected Rs 117 crore during last financial year. The department expects a 50 per cent dip in revenue collection this year, sources said. For a cash starved UT, the dip in revenue would add further to its financial woes.

1099,2016-12-23,46.0,Currency crunch not a dampener,"Tourists have started arriving at Puducherry for Christmas and New Year celebrations.   Since hotel rooms are booked online, demonetisation has not affected the occupancy rate PUDUCHERRY: The demonetisation of high value currency has not dampened the hopes of tourism industry here, the mainstay of this former French outpost with hotels and resorts registering a near total occupancy for Christmas and New Year eve. Most of the rooms in the hotels in Puducherry had been booked more than 10 days in advance, particularly by travel agencies and online travel sites beginning with Christmas and extending up to New Year. “There is occupancy of nearly 90 per cent in all hotels in Puducherry. A number of hotels in the budget and economy segments have been booked from December 24 to January 1 by tourists through travel agencies and online travel sites. Usually star category hotels reserve 10 per cent of their rooms for last minute bookings to handle pressure,” a spokesperson of the Puducherry Hotel Owners Association told The Hindu. Online travel sites provide details about the hotels based on the rankings which help the tourists to plan their vacation accordingly. Since the hotel rooms are booked online, demonetisation has not affected the occupancy rate. However, restaurants and retail outlets have seen a drop in business. The hotel management and public are facing problems in using point of sale machines at the restaurants. The network gets congested due to the huge rush and there is a need for more point of sale machines. We have approached the banks to provide more point of sale machines. But, there is a shortage of these machines, he said. “We do not have enough change to give to the customers even when they have Rs 2,000 notes. The dependency on cash in restaurants has not declined either,” a restaurant owner said. Ravindra Raju, General Manager of Hotel Accord, said the death of former Chief Minister Jayalalithaa’s and Cyclone Vardah affected the hospitality sector in Puducherry. “On an average, the occupancy in hotels in the first two weeks of December is 60 to 70 per cent. Due to the reasons cited above, we faced 30 to 40 per cent slump in the hotel occupancy in the first two weeks of December,” he said. However, we are hoping that the occupancy would increase to 80 to 90 per cent in the long weekend post Christmas. Nearly 30 to 35 percent of the tourists are expected to travel from Karnataka, he said.

V Sreenivasa Murthy The 14th edition of Chitra Sante, the much-awaited annual art mart organised by Karnataka Chitrakala Parishath (CKP) in the city, is likely to experience the impact of demonetisation, given that most transactions here have been cash based. D.K. Chowta, treasurer of the CKP, said on Thursday that anticipating the impact of demonetisation, organisers were making preparations for mobile ATMs and supplying hand-held swipwing machines (point-of-sale devices) to facilitate digital transactions. “Talks are on with bank managements to ease the problem of demonetisation,” he said. Providing change “The problem is also that artistes will have to provide change for Rs. 2,000, which is the highest denomination legal tender now,” said Mr. Chowta. Chitra Sante recorded an approximate turnover of Rs. 3 crore last year. Pointing at the positive side of digital business at the sante, art historian H.A. Anil Kumar observed that digital transaction, which was symbolic in the previous editions, would be the main course this time. “Digital payments will help us in getting the clear picture of the actual turnover during the sante,” he said. This one-day annual art mart brings together artists and connoisseurs of arts and facilitates artists to exhibit their works, including paintings, sculptures, murals, installations, and mixed-media art works. Hundreds of artists from Karnataka and elsewhere have been making use of this opportunity over the years. Chitra Santhe, which will be held on a 1-km stretch of Kumarakurpa Road from Shivananda Circle to the Office of the Chief Minister, is likely to be extended to the bylanes in and around the CKP, said Mr. Chowta. Though there is a huge demand for stalls from artistes, considering the limitations, it has been decided to allot 6 ft x 6 ft space for putting up stalls for 1,000 artistes. A committee has been formed to to keep vigil on the quality of art works as well. On second Sunday of Jan. Chitra Sante, which is usually held on the first Sunday of each year, will be held on the second Sunday this time (January 15, 2017) in view of the likely visit of Prime Minister Narendra Modi to Bengaluru in the first week, said Mr. Chowta.

Abdul Salam, a resident of Malappuram in Kerala, was taken into custody by the NIA on his arrival at the Indira Gandhi International Airport in Delhi, following his deportation from Saudi Arabia. The case was registered in 2013 when customs officials apprehended an accused, Abid Chullikulavan Hassan, at the Kochi Airport with Rs. 9.7 lakh worth fake currency notes. The NIA took over the investigations in 2014 and filed a charge sheet against five persons, including Abdul Salam.

1102,2016-12-24,47.0,?Demonetisation to infuse savings into financial markets?,"Union Finance Minister, Arun Jaitley addressing a press conference
 
| Photo Credit: Shanker Chakravarty Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s demonetisation move is altering the nation’s conduct and will infuse more formal savings into the financial markets instead of dead assets, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley said, in a possible reference to Indians’ preference for gold. Mr. Jaitley also exuded confidence that the only difficult issue pending before the Goods and Services Tax council would be resolved soon as he expected states to rise to the occasion in view of the time constraints posed by the deadline for implementing the new indirect tax regime. Though he didn’t explicitly mention the single ‘difficult issue,’ it is likely to be the ongoing tussle between the states and the Centre on the dual administrative control structure over GST payers. Recounting the reforms undertaken by the Centre in 2016, such as the formation of a Monetary Policy Committee, the passage of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy as well as the Aadhaar laws, the minister said, “Of course, the year ended with the Prime Minister’s historic decision with regard to the replacement of the high-value denomination currency, which actually is now tending to alter the manner in which we conduct ourselves.” SEBI’s role “This one decision that has ensured that a lot of money has come into the banking system, a lot of informal savings have become formal now, and therefore, the tendency to invest these more formal savings in instruments that you keep an eye on is also increasing,” he said, urging the stock market watchdog SEBI to prepare for a higher role in the months to come as he expected the size of India’s capital market to expand. “As the economy develops, the best of the Indian markets is yet to come. We have seen in recent times that our confidence itself in managing the Indian economy has been increasing,” said the minister, speaking at a function to inaugurate a new training institute set up by SEBI in Maharashtra’s Raigadh district. The entire system has been trying to encourage “ordinary citizens to channelise their savings into the market which indirectly would then contribute to the process of national development rather than be blocked only in dead assets,” he stressed. GST hopes The finance minister also termed “the whole process of deliberative democracy by which the states and the Centre have been negotiating for an early implementation of the Goods and Services Tax” as a significant reform. “We have had a series of meetings, and with each meeting we have been able to clear up most of the issues. Only one difficult issue remains pending and I have no doubt in my mind that with the time constraints we are working now, everybody will rise to the occasion and a resolution of that problem also would not be very far off,” Mr. Jaitley said, referring to the GST Council that is expected to meet on January 3 and 4 to resolve the outstanding issues that hold up implementation of the GST regime.

1103,2016-12-24,47.0,"Demonetisation a ?firebombing? on cash economy, poor: Rahul","Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi addresses a public rally, organised to mark the completion of four years of the Congress-led Himachal Pradesh government, at Dharamshala on Saturday.
  Escalating the attack on Prime Minister Narendra Modi over demonetisation, Rahul Gandhi on Saturday accused him of dividing the country between the rich and the poor and dubbed the move as “firebombing” on cash economy and farmers and labourers. Addressing a public rally here, the Congress vice-president said the Prime Minister with his note ban decision has removed the “hat” of Himachal Pradesh as it has hit hard the state’s horticulture, agriculture and tourism sectors. “Himachal’s brave soldiers carried out the surgical strikes, but Modiji thought of launching a new drama. He launched the surgical strike on corruption. “On one side the brave give away their blood and life, but here he did surgical strike on black money and corruption. Modiji this is not a surgical strike on black money and corruption. This is a firebombing and economic-bombing on the poor, farmers and labourers,” he said. Accusing Modi of dividing the country between the rich and the poor, Mr. Gandhi said, “Modiji you have tried to divide India into two parts.” “On one side are the one per cent rich comprising 50 families who have private aircraft and big buildings and on other side, there are 99 per cent honest people of India — the farmers, labourers and the middle class who built this country with their sweat and blood. You tried to divide the people of the country,” he said. He said that in the Second World War, a new way was evolved to do firebombing in 25 minutes and more people died in Tokyo firebombing than in Hiroshima bombing. “The same way Modiji has done firebombing on the poor, farmers and labourers. You have done firebombing on India’s cash economy. Not on 94 per cent of black money where it was to be done. Not on one per cent people possessing black money, but on 99 per cent poor people of the country,” he said. Showing the traditional Himachali cap, Mr. Gandhi accused Mr. Modi of putting it down and destroying it. “Modiji you have removed the Himachal’s ‘hat’ through the note ban — horticulture, agriculture and tourism. Note ban has caused a major dent on horticulture, agriculture and tourism. You have burnt the fields of honest Himachal farmers, and you did so with a smile on your face. “This note ban step was against all of you, against the honest people of India. In two-and-a-half years, the Modi government has attacked the poor of the country,” he told the crowd. Besides Mr. Gandhi, the Congress rally was addressed by Himachal Pradesh Chief Minister Virbhadra Singh and other state leaders. Himachal Pradesh goes to Assembly polls in the latter part of 2017. Mr. Gandhi said the colour of a banknote is decided by whether it is in the hands of the honest or the dishonest. “A note has no colour. There is an honest person on one side and a dishonest one on the other. If the note goes into the hands of the dishonest person like Mallya, it turns black as if under a spell of magic,” he said, referring to now-defunct Kingfisher Airlines promoter Vijay Mallya. Mr. Gandhi said the Prime Minister has given Rs 3 ‘laddoo’ to the poor people, but has given away a Rs 1,200 crore ‘laddoo’ to Vijay Mallya, who is accused of “running” away from the country after defaulting on his loans worth thousands of crores of rupees. The Congress vice-president wondered why Modi chose to target the 99 per cent honest people and not the one per cent who possess all the black money, as also on six per cent black money which is in cash and not the 94 per cent in gold, real estate and foreign banks including Swiss banks. “All black money is not in cash and all cash is not black. The one per cent people who own black money keep their thousands of crores in real estate, big buildings, gold and Swiss bank accounts. “There is only six per cent black money in cash in India. The rest of 94 per cent black money is in real estate, gold and in foreign banks. Those who stash huge sum of black money, don’t do it only in cash but in real estates, jewellery and other forms,” he said. Mr. Gandhi said this is the reason why Modi did not target the one per cent rich and he chose to target the 99 per cent people. “Modiji knows where the black money is stashed... It is with those who travel with Modiji to America. These are the same people who get all the defence contracts. These are the same people who have thousands of crores worth of land and those whose houses are worth Rs 3-4-5-6 thousand crore,” he said.

1106,2016-12-24,47.0,Demonetisation saga,"One of the reasons given by the government in defence of demonetisation was curbing black money. Within 45 days of the ban, income tax raids across the country have unearthed black/unaccounted money, in old as well as new notes. Bureaucrats, traders and barons have been caught with a huge cache of banknotes, gold and jewellery. Thus demonetisation has failed in its avowed objective while hurting the common man due to the acute shortage of cash. Very few ATMs are in operation; those which work dispense only Rs.2,000 notes — only one in a day per card. With inadequate preparations after the note ban and with numerous flip-flops on various issues concerning old currency, the credibility of the government and the Reserve Bank of India has taken a beating (Editorial – “A little gain after more pain”, Dec.23). D.B.N. Murthy, Bengaluru One myth the demonetisation saga has busted is about the Prime Minister being a fabled organiser and implementer. The government’s judgment on policy is now open to question. It is clear that the RBI is the government’s handmaiden and has been forced to face all the flak that the government’s decisions and actions have caused. What stand exposed are the frivolous pledges of Rs.15 lakh per family from black money retrieved from abroad and “less government, more governance”. Even during the Emergency, the common man’s life was not controlled as much as it is today. M. Balakrishnan, Bengaluru Long used to operating in a top-down instruction mode, the RBI now finds itself completely out of its depth. This explains why there have been nearly 60 circulars since November 8 on how to handle the demonetisation process. The central bank abdicated its role and let the Finance Ministry occupy the driving seat. The other thing is that in India there has been a long tradition of imposing a regulation and then leaving a small window of opportunity open. Srinivas Kamat, Alto Santa Cruz, Goa It is clear that the government is taking more pains to prove that the process adopted in demonetisation is perfect and matches the big task of unearthing black money. There must be many more such officials and political bigwigs who have such unaccounted-for wealth. It just needs the political will to unearth all this. When the government is aware of all these sources of ill-gotten wealth, why have demonetisation? Such searches could have been carried out in normal times as well. In reality, it is the common man who is being put to hardship. A.G. Rajmohan, Anantapur, Andhra Pradesh Going cashless appears to be the way forward but are we ready for a cashless society? Rome was not built within a day and a cashless society won’t be realised overnight. It takes relentless, incremental and piecemeal progress to make that happen. The need for the government to push everyone to use digital payment is to make them dependent on the banking system. A “cashless society” can also be a way for the government to gain full control of your finances. Going cashless is a very bold move, but has a lot of risks and the government should address them. Physical money can’t be hacked or infected by a virus. These things can happen with representative money. By bringing everyone under the umbrella of a digital economy, we are creating a monstrous system rife with more fraud and vulnerable to security breaches and disastrous glitches. In a developing country such as ours where uninterrupted power supply is a pipe dream, going cashless does not suit our conditions. The government cannot comb through every single transaction to validate and provide protection. The reconciliation system is also not well evolved enough to protect you from transactional errors. These issues have to be addressed. Bhimashankar N. Sanga, Bengaluru In my opinion, one cannot fault the idea behind demonetisation. There is support for the move, seen in the uncomplaining masses queuing up before banks and ATMs even when they find their wait has been to no purpose most of the time. If the government wants to stem the rot, the ‘traitors’ — some bank staff and politicians who have taken advantage of the situation — should be punished with rigorous jail terms, confiscation of assets and removal from all positions of authority forthwith without consideration. If the government fails this time, the BJP’s standing will be severely eroded. It might be better to go slow on cashless transactions till such time as a foolproof system is evolved. There are not so many computer-literate Indians who will be able to detect fraud. P. Balagopalan, Palakkad In these trying times of demonetisation, unscrupulous elements in the banking system have emerged as the main culprits in ruining what could have been a smooth transition to a cashless economy into a rocky ride. Hoarders of black money in collusion with these elements have successfully converted black money into white, while it has been a struggle for the ordinary citizen to draw even a few hundreds of his hard-earned money for his basic needs. This brazen betrayal on the part of a few rotten apples is fast eroding the faith most of us have in our banking system. This episode is a black mark. A. Bhavana Praveen, Somwarpet, Kodagu, Karnataka Will demonetisation, that started with a bang, end in a whimper soon? Otherwise, why does one have changed guidelines every second day? The mantra being chanted is one of a cashless economy and a digital India, where cash is dirt and cashless clean. But cash is financial autonomy, a bird in the hand. Even developed countries such as Germany and the U.S. still have transactions in cash. With poor literacy, connectivity and networking in villages, and an inadequate density of banking in villages, is it feasible to fully embrace going cashless? The country has the world’s largest population of illiterate adults at 287 million, amounting to 37 per cent of the global total (UN report, 2014), who cannot be wished away.

1107,2016-12-24,47.0,Demonetisation: e-initiatives help TTD tide over cash crisis,"TIRUPATI: Even as many government institutions are grappling with the currency challenges posed by the demonetisation exercise, the Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanams (TTD) has remained largely insulated from the move. The smooth transition from cash to a cashless system today is obviously a result of the measures initiated more than a year back, when demonetisation was not even in the air. The allocation of more Seeghra Darshan (Rs. 300) tickets for online quota last year came under fire, when people wondered how people in the rural and semi-urban areas would access the internet. While retaining the option of allowing across-the-counter booking through its information centres and post offices, the TTD consciously made available more tickets for the net-savvy, which was later hailed as a welcome measure to encourage online booking. Later, many people comfortably migrated to booking their darshan tickets, accommodation, extra laddus and even made donations through the web. After the announcement on demonetisation on November 8, the TTD management swiftly arranged 10 PoS machines from its banker to meet the crowd at the counters having pilgrim transactions. “We are trying to technology-enable all the points, where we have transaction interface with the pilgrims,” says TTD Executive Officer D. Sambasiva Rao. So far, nearly 40 counters have been covered with PoS/swiping machines and the number is growing at a rapid pace. Efforts are on to install GPRS-enabled PoS/swiping machines to tackle the problem to a large extent. Two-machine system The officials now plan to double the number of machines at any given point of transaction. The initiative is aimed at meeting the burgeoning e-literate crowd and also to avoid technology-related irritants such as failure of a bank’s server. “We will have two machines, one by a scheduled bank and the other likely of a private bank,” as a fall-back arrangement,” adds TTD Financial Advisor and Chief Accounts Officer O. Balaji.

1108,2016-12-25,48.0,"Demonetisation, protectionism worry exporters as they brace to face 2017","NEW DELHI: The main concerns of India’s exporters, as they brace themselves for yet another tumultuous year in international trade, are the problems locally due to the demonetisation-triggered cash crunch, as well as the rising support for protectionism in Europe and the U.S. owing to the backlash against globalisation. Goods exports to the U.S. and the European Union nations — that are India’s traditional and main markets for its shipments — had accounted for 16 per cent and 17 per cent respectively of India’s total goods exports of $263 billion in 2015-16. However, in what could hurt India’s exports, the incoming administration in the U.S. is widely expected to announce protectionist policies given President-elect Donald Trump’s statements that America’s manufacturing sector has been severely hit by their policies and trade agreements promoting free-trade. In Europe, the Netherlands, France and Germany are going in for general / presidential elections in 2017, and parties and politicians backing policies that are protectionist and anti-immigration are gaining mileage. Then, there is the negotiation of the terms and conditions of Britain’s exit from the European Union to watch out for. “The outcome of Brexit negotiations and polls in EU countries, especially Germany, will have a bearing on the overall sentiments on global trade. If the EU disintegrates, it will add to the uncertainties in global trade, impacting India’s trade as well,” said Ajay Sahai, director general and chief executive officer, Federation of Indian Export Organisations – the apex body for Indian exporters. Also, if there are more rate hikes by the U.S. Federal Reserve in 2017, it will lead to a flight of capital from emerging market economies (other than India) and weaken their currencies, in turn hitting the competitiveness of India’s exports, he added. Weak recovery Plagued by the lingering feeble external demand, India’s goods exports had contracted from December 2014 to May 2016, but then registered positive growth for the first time in 18 months with a 1.97 per cent year-on-year growth in June. However, it immediately fell back into negative growth territory in July and August before recovering to post positive growth from September onwards. The 2.29 per cent growth in November was, however, less than 8.22 per cent growth in October. Japanese financial major Nomura, in a recent report, had said demonetisation has hit export volumes much more than imports, and that the cash crunch induced by demonetisation has hurt cash-intensive export sectors such as gems & jewellery and textiles. Ashok Rajani, Chairman, Apparel Export Promotion Council, said: “While demonetisation is a step in the right direction, exporters (in the textiles sector that employs many workers on a temporary or seasonal basis) are a troubled lot as of now with several workers finding it difficult to open bank accounts (to get their wages on a non-cash basis).” Pointing out that many migrant workers in Delhi, Tirupur (Tamil Nadu) and Karnataka are returning to their villages, he hoped the government would take measures soon to provide relief. Small and medium firms, including those catering to overseas markets, are facing difficulties in raising working capital with the cash crunch hitting their informal sources of finance. Turning to the scheduled commercial banks for working capital would not only be a difficult proposition given their small size, but would also increase their cost of funds when compared to cheaper funds from informal sources. While the demonetisation became effective November 9, trade data for the month showed that exports grew at a much slower pace than imports (2.29 per cent growth versus 10.44 per cent) leading to a trade deficit of $13 billion, the highest since $13.08 billion in July 2015. The Centre is slated to hold a meeting with the state governments early January on measures to boost exports and then follow it up soon with a meeting of the Board of Trade (the government-industry body for providing suggestions on trade policy measures). The impact of demonetisation, especially on the labour-intensive export sectors, is likely to top the agenda. The government will also seek a response on whether the $900 billion goods and services export target set to be achieved by 2019-20 will be feasible given the slowdown in global trade, and if the target should be lowered to a more realistic level. The Centre will also hold stakeholder consultations on the mid-term review of the Foreign Trade Policy 2015-20 so that measures — including on market- and product-diversification, reduction of transaction costs, support to labour-intensive and sensitive sectors as well as ensuring credit at lower cost — can be taken when the policy is announced in September 2017.

He was addressing a meeting at Secretariat to mark the ‘National Consumers Day’ here on Saturday. The scarcity of currency has caused immense problems to common people, the Finance Minister said. However, the Government has supported the move as it aimed to reinforce the constitutional spirit of equitable distribution of the country’s wealth among all its citizens. Chief Minister K.Chandrasekhar Rao has made a few suggestions to Prime Minister Narendra Modi on how to preclude inconvenience to people, the Minister said. Banking at e-POS The Civil supplies Department was implementing a project to facilitate bank transactions through the e-POS terminals at the fair price shops spread across the state, Civil Supplies Commissioner C.V.Anand said in his address. There are 17,200 fair price shops, many of them at remote places where banks do not have their branches. The fair price shops can be the points of Aadhaar enabled payment system, where bills can be paid online through biometrics or iris scan. This will be effective in the context of the push for digital transactions post-demonetisation. The project will be initiated in a month’s time, and implemented phase-wise in all FP shops by April next year, Mr. Anand said on the sidelines of the meeting. “The present e-POS system is based on Linux operating system, and needs to be changed to Android,” Mr. Anand said. The Department would be calling for tenders soon for purchase of Aadhaar-linked Android-based e-POS machines, the Commissioner Civil Supplies said.

| Photo Credit: Kommuri Srinivas The Christmas eve celebrations were a low-key affair this year as the cash crunch in the wake of demonetisation of high value notes hits sale of decorative material and even cakes and pastries. “There is a substantial fall in the sale of decorative material, including stars, this year,” say the owners of fancy shops on the arterial Trunk road. “We managed to decorate our houses with whatever leftover material bought last year,” says a group of Christian youths at Thurpu Christianpalem, where the celebrations, which used to reach a new peak year after year, took a beating with the members of the community preferring quiet celebrations this year. Elders used to give donations for youth to recreate heaven-like situation at every street corner to rejoice the birth of Lord Jesus. This has also taken a beating this year, they add. “There is also a 60 per cent fall in the sale of cakes and pastries this year,” adds a popular baker in the city. While those having plastic cards are a fortunate lot, others find it difficult to mobilise enough cash to keep their kith and kin in good humour at a time when prices of dresses keep going up, says G.V. Raj Vimal, a Christian youth from Cloughpet. With reduced budget on hand, youths from Kabadipalem put an attractive star not to spoil their mood on the Christmas eve, even as their parents dispensed with ‘pindi vantalu’ usually prepared every year with lesser cash on hand to spend. There were not many stars and Christmas trees in Christian colonies this year. Meanwhile, churches across Prakasam district, including the 108-year-old Jewett Memorial Baptist Church, have been spruced up for the big festival. The JMB Church, the mother of all Baptist churches in Telangana, Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu as well, was illuminated as also the over 150 member churches of the Ongole Denomination of churches in the city and elsewhere in the district as faithful geared up for the midnight mass. The month-long semi-Christmas celebrations peaked on the Christmas eve with the faithful singing carols in different churches.

1112,2016-12-25,48.0,When a currency note turns cash cow,"Capitalising on the crippling shortage of currency and the fancies of the masses are “collectors” selling the newly introduced high denomination notes with ‘fancy numbers’ for an asking price many times the actual value of the note. A Hyderabad-based individual, who claims to be a currency aficionado, put up for sale on Friday evening a new Rs. 500 note numbered ‘8AL 839786’, asking Rs. 2000 for it. Within an hour, his Facebook post attracted several comments questioning the legality of the sale and threats to alert cops, but an equal number of comments revealing interest in the offer. “I fancy doing it. So what? I have sold a Rs. 2000 note which was numbered all ‘7s’ for Rs. 20,000. Tell me how much can you give?” he asked this reporter when contacted on the mobile number provided in his post. The man said he struck a deal at Rs. 5000 for the “lucky” Rs. 500 note, which he possibly believes holds more value in its suffixed serial number than its legal tender. “The offer came from a man who said he wants to give the note as a birthday present. I can give it to you for Rs. 4000,” he said. A cursory web search reveals new notes, along with older notes including the recently demonetised high denomination currency, are being auctioned on e-commerce portals including eBay. Social media too is used for the purpose. The asking price for the notes ranges anywhere between 10 times and 100 times of their tender value. The trade is not covert; sellers accept payment electronically and also agree to ship the note. Interestingly, the searches for the term ‘786 note’ spiked on Google search after November 8 when Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced demonetisation of Rs. 500 and Rs. 1000 notes. Seasoned numismatists say there is no law that prohibits such sale but the legality of the matter is in the grey. Though licensed auction houses in the country auction legal notes and coins with minting or printing errors and with fancy numbers, there have been instances of courts taking objection in the past by citing various sections of the law. A court in Indore reportedly sought explanations from online portals allowing sale of tendered currency while hearing a public interest litigation petition last year. When cyber crime wings of Hyderabad and Cyberabad were contacted to check if they received complaints against the trade, they replied being unaware.

1113,2016-12-25,48.0,Dasara exhibition extended till Jan. 8 as demonetisation hits revenue,"more days to shop: The annual Dasara exhibition, being held at Doddakere Maidan in Mysuru, was originally scheduled to end on December 25.   The Karnataka Exhibition Authority (KEA) has decided to extend the annual Dasara exhibition at Doddakere Maidan here by another two weeks after exhibitors complained of losses owing to demonetisation. The exhibition, inaugurated on October 1, was to conclude on December 25 (Sunday), but will now be on till January 8. Bengaluru-based Fun World and Resorts had bagged this year’s contract for 137 stalls, the entertainment zone and the food court for ₹4.11 crore. When the contractor brought the matter of losses to the notice of the authorities, the KEA decided to extend the exhibition by two more weeks, authority CEO Shashi Kumar told The Hindu. However, KEA will be collecting maintenance expenses from the contractor for the extension period. “We will collect from them the electricity and security expenditure and the cleaning charges,” he said. The extension will also bring additional revenue to KEA as the gate collection and parking fee goes to it. The exhibitors had complained that they had suffered losses of up to 30 per cent this year. “The KEA too had anticipated 12.5 to 13 lakh visitors this year, after it drew a lot of crowds in October. We expected to earn more than ₹2.5 crore from gate collection and parking fee, but we could do no more than ₹2.2 crore,” Mr. Shashi Kumar said. Though the exhibition had begun under the shadow of the Cauvery dispute between Karnataka and Tamil Nadu, the turnout was fairly good at the start. But the exhibitors began feeling the pinch after the Centre withdrew the ₹500 and ₹1,000 notes early in November.

1114,2016-12-26,49.0,Demonetisation hits real estate,"The collection from the Department of Stamps and Registration during November-December (till date) has fallen short by nearly 27 per cent.

M_A_SRIRAM;M_A_SRIRAM - M_A_SRIRAM The demonetisation effect that has brought down revenue collection in the State has set alarm bells ringing. The collection from the Department of Stamps and Registration during November-December (till date) has fallen short by nearly 27 per cent, and this is the worst performance for the department during the same period in the last five years. While real estate has taken a hit, the Commercial Taxes Department — which will get a final data on tax collection during November only in January — is also estimating a loss of about 8 per cent, sources in the department said. Expecting a large hole in revenue collection for the fiscal following demonetisation, Chief Minister Siddaramaiah, who also holds the finance portfolio, has convened a review meet of all four major revenue streams — Commercial Tax, Excise, Transport, and Stamps and Registration on Wednesday. Senior officials in the Department of Stamps and Registration told The Hindu that with the cash crunch likely to persist, they expect the trend to continue till the end of the financial year, leading to deficits in targeted revenue of Rs. 9,100 crore this fiscal. “If cash crunch persists till the end of the fiscal, the market will be down for two quarters that is half-a-year,” a senior official explained. In fact, November-December period was a bad patch for revenue collection even during 2015 when the new revised guidance value that saw a hike in the range of 10 to 200 per cent came into force, leading to a crash in the number of transactions. Among the two months, December has performed a tad worse, which officials attribute to completion of property deals that were mid-way when the demonetisation was announced on November 8. “In November, sellers were even accepting payments in old currency in part. However, by December, no transaction involved old currency and even lesser number of property deals were struck,” a Sub-Registrar in Bengaluru said. Bengaluru performs better in State Bengaluru, which constitutes nearly 65 per cent of the realty market in the State, has performed slightly better compared to other parts during the past two months, as the revenue shortfall against the targets set is around 22 per cent. “In the apartment sector, most of the corporates have shifted to transactions completely in white for some years now. Moreover, payments for flats are usually staggered over a time-table during development of the project, which was not much affected during the last two months,” said Suresh Hari of CREDAI, Bengaluru. Guidance value revision postponed In the light of the slump in realty transactions post-demonetisation, the Department of Stamps and Registration that was scheduled to revise guidance value rates in November has put off the exercise indefinitely. “Already, there is a slump in the market. Last year’s data shows that post revision, it took more than three months for the market to settle down. In the immediate transactions fell by nearly 30 per cent. Revision of guidance value during a slump will only add to it. We have decided to take a call on the revision only in the next fiscal,” said a senior official.

K.R. Deepak Union Home Minister Rajnath Singh on Monday claimed that people have supported Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s “bold step” of demonetising Rs. 1,000 and old Rs. 500 notes and his fight against black money and corruption. “The Prime Minister’s bold step of demonetisation has been welcomed by the people of the country and we are grateful for that,” Mr. Singh told BJP workers here. The Prime Minister’s fight against black money and corruption was “beyond any doubt” and the people of the country have expressed their gratitude by supporting him despite facing initial difficulties, the Minister said. “People did face initial difficulties after demonetisation was announced, but now they have come down considerably,” he claimed. “People had to wait for hours in queues outside ATMs, but when told they were facing difficulties, many replied, ‘When our jawans our dying on the borders to protect our country against enemies, then why can’t we stand in queues for a few hours.’ This is the spirit of our people,” Mr. Singh said. On November 8, Mr. Modi made the demonetisation announcement. The Home Minister urged party workers to take the BJP government’s achievements to people and ensure that the poor benefited from their work. “The BJP is committed to the development of the poor and the farmers and they must benefit from our schemes. Only then real development will take place in the country,” he said. In Assam too, development would be difficult if the condition of farmers is not improved and “it is a positive thing that the party is in power at the Centre and the State”. “Party workers must realise that the BJP is not here for five years. Ensure we serve people for the next 25 years,” he said.

Patil said the prices of agricultural products have been hit in a big way following demonetisation. Speaking to mediapersons in Tumakuru city on Monday, Mr. Patil said farmers are incurring huge losses after demonetisation, with a steep fall in the prices of vegetables, including onion, chillies, tomato and paddy, jowar. He said the farmers cannot hoard the perishable products for 2-3 months as they do not have facilities available with the food processing industries. The prices of vegetables have fallen to one eighth of the price. He asked: ""Tell me one small action they ( Union government) have taken to help the farmers who have incurred big losses due to demonetisation."" He further said that the Union government must compensate the losses faced by farmers. Lashing out at former chief minister B.S. Yeddyurappa for saying that two ministers will lose their power after crores of rupees was recovered in the State, Mr. Patil said such statement would only lead to people losing trust in Central Bureau of Investigation and Enforcement Directorate.

  Winter shopping and piping hot food are a huge draw at Majnu ka Tila, a Tibetan colony in north Delhi, every year. This year, however, sales have not warmed up as the market has been bitten by the demonetisation chill. Just like most other businesses and markets, this area too faced the consequences of the note ban. Most of the shops in the area still rely on cash transactions to run their daily business. Sceptical of online money While some lack the means to acquire POS machines and e-wallets, several others are sceptical of online money considering the risks involved. Shop owners rely on their everyday sales to make ends meet and with a significant dip in purchases, their livelihoods have taken a hit. “I help my cousins run their garments store. A person would buy a shirt worth Rs. 400 and then expect us to give change for Rs. 2,000, which is very difficult. The high denomination note is a major reason why we have lost most of our customers. Although this policy might help curb black money and corruption, the policy-makers have not kept the lower strata of society in mind,” said a student who is pursuing her PhD from Delhi University. Ashok Kumar, a Delhi resident, has been running a shop at Majnu ka Tila for over 15 years now. He considers himself lucky as he had a card swipe machines installed and made provisions for e-wallet transactions over six months ago. Restaurant owners hit “My sales have been better than a lot of other shops as cash transactions are problematic these days. The market has customers, but sales have reduced a bit. Online shopping portals have been flourishing even more, but at our expense,” he said, adding that the entire commotion will have a positive result in the end. Restaurant owners in the market have also been facing problems. “Initially, the impact was severe and the restaurant seemed deserted. However, the situation has improved now. I started accepting e-wallet payments to make things easy for my customers,” said, Rabyanj, owner of the Zakhang Restaurant. Although he does not accept debit/credit payments, he feels that the inflow of customers at his eatery is gradually normalising.

Mallikarjun Kharge and the former Chief Minister N. Dharam during Mr. Singh’s 80th birthday celebrations in Kalaburagi on Sunday.
  Chief Minister Siddaramaiah has alleged that Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced demonetisation to divert people’s attention from the failures of his government. He was speaking at a function to mark the former Chief Minister N. Dharam Singh’s 80th birthday celebrations here on Sunday. The Chief Minister dedicated more time in his 40-minute speech to attack the BJP than describing his government’s pro-people initiatives. “During the campaigning for the last Lok Sabha elections, the BJP had promised to bring home black money stashed in tax havens abroad and deposit ₹15 lakh into the bank accounts of every citizen. It had given a number of similar and attractive promises. But, it fulfilled none of them. In order to divert people’s attention from his failure, Mr. Modi announced demonetisation,” he said. Poor people are unable to withdraw their own hard earned money from banks, let alone receiving the promised ₹15 lakh, Mr. Siddaramaiah said. “Unlike the BJP, we did what we had promised. We have fulfilled over 125 of 165 pre-poll promises. We will fulfil the rest before next Assembly elections. People will again vote us to power. BJP leaders are in an illusion and are day-dreaming of coming to power in the State. That will never happen,” he said. Terming BJP leaders as “liars” and “deceivers”, Mr. Siddaramaiah called upon his party workers to get aggressive in countering the false propaganda of the party and the Sangh Parivar. “The BJP, the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh and their parivar are known for lying and spreading falsehood. In their efforts to win the hearts of people, they are trying to embrace Buddha, Basava, Ambedkar, Gandhi and other such icons. The secular ideology of these social reformers and communal ideology of the BJP and the Sangh Parivar are quite opposite to each other. The former binds people and latter divides them. The former advocates peaceful coexistence of different communities and the latter encourages ignite clashes among them,” he said. Mr. Siddaramaiah appealed to the followers of the social reformers to disassociate and distance themselves from the BJP. Ridiculing BJP leaders’ tour in drought-hit areas, the Chief Minister asked them to get the funds released from Union government as per National disaster Response Fund (NDRF) norms. “As per NDRF norms, we have sought ₹4,702 crore from the Union government for drought relief. Even after two months of we writing letter, there is no response,” he said.

While no comprehensive data is available about the MGNREGA disbursement through bank accounts, the situation could be no better even there, as banks too are grappling with demonetisation blues. ‘Upadhi Hamee Phone Radio’, an initiative in Gattu mandal of Mahabubnagar district funded by the Libtech India, has collated the online data using digital tools. In Telangana, the total pending wages to be disbursed through post-office accounts stood at Rs. 40.2 crore and the average rate of disbursement since November 9 has been mere Rs. 10.68 lakh. An average of 1.1 lakh workers reported to work every day, requiring daily payment of Rs. 2.13 crore, which will keep being added to the pending wages. Each worker is paid Rs.194 as the daily wages. In case of Andhra Pradesh, the total dues to MGNREGS workers amounted to Rs.191.6 crore, with the rate of disbursement at Rs.1.5 crore on an average, which means that 128 days are needed even to clear the present dues. Calculated at the average of 2.7 lakh workers attending work every day, over Rs.5.26 crore are added to pending wages on daily basis. “Predominant means of MGNREGS disbursement in AP are post-office accounts, while in Telangana, they continue to be the major payment channel. Even without the demonetisation move, the payments are delayed by over a month on regular basis, due to lack of staff and infrastructure. The note ban has only made the matters worse, as cash is hardly accessible,” said Chakradhar Buddha, the Programme Manager (TS & AP), Libtech India. Under postal disbursement, branch post masters are designated to collect the wages from the postal divisional headquarters, and disburse the amounts to workers at Panchayats. However, with each post master burdened with responsibilities of three or more Panchayats, the payments get invariably delayed. “Further, afraid to carry large amounts of cash, they bring only about Rs. 4 lakh to Rs. 5 lakh each day. Now, cash remaining inaccessible, they are hardly bringing any,” Mr. Buddha says. Over 7.65 lakh workers in AP and over 4 lakh workers in Telangana are waiting for their wages over 90 days, he says.

Developing resources to enhance tourism in Uttarakhand will work for the benefit of the State and we wish to work on it. * We wish to make Uttarakhand ia State where people are not forced to move to over-crowded cities in search of employment. * Our rural electrification plan is not for the rich. It is for the poor. * I have worked in Uttarakhand for years as an [RSS] worker and I'm aware of the difficult life of the hills.

Narayanasamy told presspersons here that although senior leaders of the party abstained from the protest, he had apprised the Prime Minister of the difficulties faced by the people due to demonetisation. On the Union Government’s move to promote cashless transaction, he said basic infrastructure should be first put in place before pushing for cashless transactions. “The government should first ensure that sufficient infrastructure was in place in rural and semi urban areas by opening branches of banks. “The cashless transaction should be implemented in a phased manner,” he said.

It had lot of cash and credit cards,” said S. Vasantha, the fisherwoman. She visits the fish market in Red Hills every day to buy fish and sells it near her house in Kodipallam village in Sholavaram taluk. On her trip to the market, she was accompanied by a friend who urged her to keep the wallet. “But it was someone else’s money, and clearly, they had lost it. I could not keep it,” she said. After buying ice, Vasantha headed home with the wallet. She told her son about it and the duo checked the wallet to find it had Rs.11,585 in cash, a driving licence and credit cards. They also identified the owner of the wallet as Shiva Pillai, a city-based consultant. They immediately contacted him after finding his phone number from one of the cards. A further surprise “We first cross-checked with him about the wallet’s contents. He said there was Rs.8000 in cash but when we told him there was a lot more, he was very surprised,” said Marimuthu, Vasantha’s son. Marimuthu was left disabled and unemployed after meeting with an accident many months ago. Around 8.30 p.m, Shiva Pillai rushed to their house and retrieved his wallet and profusely thanked them. It turned out he had dropped the wallet while getting into his car after making a purchase at the market. “I was overwhelmed when I heard they wanted to return my wallet safely,” he said. After handing him his wallet, the family refused to accept any monetary gift. Touched by their gesture, Shiva offered a job to her grandson, who was in dire need of it. “I’m trying to put him in a good place where he can earn a decent living to support his family. This is the least I can do,” he said. “At a time, when everyone is running behind money, people like Vasantha and Marimuthu are a rarity,” he said.

  Demonetisation of high denomination currency seems to have had its effect on New Year celebrations too. Preparations have been affected as many ATMs are running out of money here. With not enough cash in hand, many city residents are planning to spend the New Year Eve with their family at home and watch special cultural programmes on TV. Another deterrent is the high charges in hotels. “Prices are too high in hotels for the middle class. So it is better to celebrate the New Year with family at home,” says Satish, an employee in a private company. Yet, as New Year celebrations have assumed the status of a national festival with all sections of society involving themselves in it, only the scale seems to have come under the shadow of demonetisation. Meanwhile, some of the hotels which have been regularly hosting parties have dropped the event this year. But, there is always a place to party, even a roadside ‘dhaba’ is not a bad place to make merry, say many. There are social clubs too that are gearing up for the celebrations. The most glamorous and expensive one in the pipeline seems to be the event being organised at the Belgaum Club on Club Road, which is headed by the Inspector-General of Police and the Deputy Commissioner is its vice-president. Hectic preparations are going on on the club premises to make the celebrations spectacular. The event will commence from 7.30 p.m. on December 31. The club has organised a special cultural programme by music band and artistes from Bengaluru. The special programme will feature Live DJ, music, dance floor, fireworks, snacks and dinner. However, the admission is as usual reserved through members only. The admission fee for the members is ₹3,500 (couple) and guest couple is ₹4,500, an official source at the club said. An interesting and most common public celebration in the city is the burning of the ‘old man’ in every locality. The tall old man, an effigy symbolising the ‘past’ and the all that is considered as ‘bad’ is erected in every locality. It attracts a large number of people who watch the burning of the ‘bad past’ and the ‘sins’ committed in the passing year and welcome the New Year with new resolutions.

1127,2016-12-28,51.0,BJP leader questions MT on demonetisation,"BJP State general secretary A. N. Radhakrishnan has questioned the motive behind the statement of writer M.T. Vasudevan Nair that the common man faced the brunt on account of the Centre’s demonetisation drive. Relying to a query at the news conference here on Wednesday, he wondered on what basis MT, a renowned writer, made a comment on an economic policy adopted by the Centre. “ He is no economist to react to the growing need for a cashless currency in the country. We could understand if writer A. Sethumadhavan , a retired banker had given his opinion about demonetisation. He should know that more than 87 lakh people in the State are active Facebook users and that 4.25 lakh own mobile phones, ” he said. MT had made the comments about demonstration while releasing the book 'Kallappana Vetta: Mithyayum Yadharthyavum' authored by Finance Minister T.M. Thomas Isaac at a function held at Thunjanparamba in Tirur. “The people of the State would also like to know his views on the underdevelopment in the State, ” he said. Mr. Radhakrishnan said that MT was not the list of the aspirants seeking any plum posts from the CPI (M)-led LDF government. “So why should he make such a comment. At the same time, he remained mum when CPI (M) dissident leader T.P. Chandrasekharan was hacked to death and when triple talaq was a raging issue at his hometown, ” he said.

1128,2016-12-28,51.0,"?Demonetisation, a serious administrative flaw?","Karaikudi: Launching a broadside against Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Congress leader P. Chidambaram termed the demonetisation decision a ‘serious administrative flaw’, and said the present cash crunch would continue even after April, 2017. Talking to reporters here on Wednesday, he said as Mr. Modi had announced the demonetisation of 500 and 1000 rupee notes without proper planning and understanding, and that people were put to untold sufferings and the government had become inept. Besides the poor and common people, the demonetisation move had severed affected the small industries sector with nearly 50 per cent of garment units in Tirupur remained shut. A mill in Kalayarkoil remained shut for a month as it could not sell the products worth Rs.15 crore, he said. Hundred and thousands of daily wage workers were rendered jobless and most of the busy markets were closed, he said. Farmers were the worst hit as the prices of vegetables and fruits plummeted. It may be good news for the consumers but the Indian farmers had suffered loss to the tune of several lakh crore of rupees, he said. Asserting that no purpose would be served by the demonetisation, he said the Centre expected that about Rs.Five lakh crore of the Rs.15.44 lakh crore in circulation would not come back to the banks after the demonetisation but his reliable source in Mumbai had said the banks had so far received 14.32 lakh crore of old currencies and the balance would also deposited in the coming days, he said. Referring to the seizures of huge amount of new currencies from few individuals in the country, Mr Chidambaram said the ‘leakages’ of the new currency notes were possible through the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) printing presses, RBI and bank branches and the fact that the ‘leakages’ continued unabated reflected the administrative flaw. Mr. Modi who had announced the demonetisation to wipe out black money, was now talking about cashless transaction, which, he said, was absurd. “What has began as a football match has become a hockey match now,” he said ridiculing the Centre for “failing” to address the cash crunch. On cashless transaction, he said even in the US and other advanced western countries, where there was round-the-clock power supply and ATMs worked 24x7, cash transactions amounted to 45 to 55 per cent. Cashless transaction may be advisable for high value transaction but not for low value, he said. The electronic mode of payment would benefit only some private companies, he added.

The revenue collection dipped by Rs. 300 crore during November-December. Expecting lower revenue collection for the current fiscal year following demonetisation, Chief Minister Siddaramaiah, who also holds the finance portfolio, convened a review meet of all four major revenue generating departments — Commercial Tax, Excise, Transport, and Stamps and Registration - on Wednesday to asses the actual realisation of the revenue during the year. In fact, November-December, 2016, period was a bad patch for revenue collection for all the four departments due to demonetisation, sources said. The Government has set a target of Rs. 83,864 crore for all the four departments during 2016-17. Sources said Mr. Siddaramaiah told officials to make a realistic estimation of expenditure requirements during the year based on the progress implementation of various schemes. He also suggested to the officials to study the impact of demonetisation of high value currency and take appropriate measures to collect the revenue as per the target in the next three months. The Excise Department has registered a dip in IML sales and hence the Chief Minister told the officials to make efforts to ensure collection of excise duties as projected during the year. The department has set the target of Rs. 16,510 crore during 2016-17. There was also decline of Rs. 43 crore in the collection of motor vehicle taxes during November and December months following decline in the number of registration of new vehicles. It has set a target of Rs. 5160 crore during the year. The government has set revenue collection target at Rs. 51,338 for Commercial Tax and Rs. 9,100 crore for Stamps and Registration department. The collection from the Department of Stamps and Registration has fallen short by 27 per cent, and the cash crunch has adversely impacted registration of properties. The trend is expected to continue till the end of the financial year, sources said.

V. Sudershan Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi on Wednesday continued his attack on Prime Minister Narendra Modi over demonetisation, accusing him of practising politics of “fear and anger” and exhorted partymen to defeat his ideology. “On November 8, Modiji said he is performing a ‘yagya’ against corruption and black money. In every yagya, someone’s sacrifice is done and every yagya is done to benefit someone. “The demonetisation ‘yagya’ is for 50 families of the country’s 1 per cent super rich. It is the poor, farmers, labourers, middle class and small shopkeepers who are being sacrificed in this ‘yagya’. There has been tremendous pain caused by it,” he said presiding over Congress Party’s 132nd Foundation Day celebrations, The Congress will stand with people, farmers, labourers, middle-class and small shopkeepers and with the country and help them, he said, exhorting Congressmen to reach out to those “pained” by demonetisation and fight and defeat the ideology of Modi and RSS that spreads “fear and hatred“. “Congress workers have to reach out to people and I am confident that they will do this and will fight out and defeat the ideology of Narendra Modi and RSS which spreads anger and hate,” he said. Accusing Mr. Modi for hurting financial independence of people of this country, he asked on what basis limits of Rs. 24,000 were imposed on withdrawal. Firsts for Mr. Gandhi Filling in for his mother and Congress President Sonia Gandhi who is not keeping well, MR. Gandhi, for the first time on Tuesday, unfurled the Tricolour at the party headquarters to mark Foundation Day. In another first, he later addressed a gathering of top party leaders, including all members of the Congress Working Committee. Mr. Gandhi also used the occasion to trace the party’s history of sacrifices and struggles and said Congress was synonymous with acceptance of the other. “Congress means understanding the other. Congress means I am not alone and that there is another perspective apart from mine. Congress is the idea that it is not only my view that will prevail. I must seek your view. Congress means reaching out to you, Congress means listening to you. Congress means understanding the other,” he told the gathering. Seeking to project the BJP as a divisive force as against an inclusive Congress, he said, “Modi government is today tearing apart the fabric of our country. Modiji’s policies are creating a tremendous fear psychosis among people. Modiji is trying to convert this fear and pain into hatred. Demonetisation is an example of this. “The aim is to run a government of select few, take away the money from the poor and give it to a select few. Spread fear and anger and rule on that basis. We have shown that questions have been raised on Modiji and there are charges on him. He should answer these questions,” he said. Mr. Gandhi traced Congress’ history of fighting the freedom struggle and said, “Congress helped people understand the meaning of Swaraj and independence. Congress helps fight fear.” The functioning of the party is not about an an individual but about everyone, he said. “I would first want to talk about what is relationship of people of the country with Congress party. It is that of sharing pain and of sharing emotions. This idea says that you are not alone. They gave a name to that idea and called it Congress,” the party Vice President said. He said the note ban decision had robbed the poor people of their money, and was intended to be given to the rich of the country. He said it was the poor, the farmers, labourers, the middle class and the common people who are suffering the most. Today’s event was significant because its rare for the party vice-president to preside over the Foundation Day function. A large number of senior Congress leaders were present on the occasion.

1132,2016-12-28,51.0,Demonetisation turns prospects blurry for Varanasi lenswoman,"UNCERTAIN FUTURE: Photographer Sita Sahani with her camera in the ghats of Varanasi. — Photo: Rajeev Bhatt
  It was the day after Christmas, prime time for those relying on tourism to earn their livelihood. With a small camera bag flung over her shoulder, Sita Sahani desperately chased after tourists, revellers, pilgrims and indolent spectators to have their pictures clicked in Varanasi. The backdrop of the famous Dashashwamedh Ghat was as usual exquisite — the winter sun bouncing off the waters of the Ganga. The fading mist added to the panorama, which included scores of boats, colourful banners and flags, and plenty of ritual markers. As was her routine, Ms. Sahani came to the ghat at dawn to make the most of the morning rush and scene. But even as the clock struck 11, she had not had a single taker for her pictures. It has been the same story each day since demonetisation took effect, she rues. “The customers have no currency. Why would they waste money on getting a picture clicked instead of spending on more essential items...I have yet to open my score for today,” said Ms. Sahani, 36, who is among the handful of women photographers who trail tourists on the ghats of Varanasi for a living. An estimated 300-500 self-trained photographers ply their trade on the ghats here. Post-demonetisation, however, they are finding it hard to make a living. While tourists have cut down on their expenses due to shortage of cash, the usual crowd to the ghats this season has also visibly gone down. “There were instances where we clicked the picture costing Rs. 20 but the customer offered us a Rs. 500 note. How do we provide them the change? We had to forfeit the money and the pictures clicked went to waste,” says Ms. Sahani. Since November 8, her earnings have shrunk drastically. Reconsidering job Demonetisation is not the only reason why Ms. Sahani, and many in her field, are considering alternative occupations. The popularitiy of the smartphone and the “selfie” trend have made her occupation redundant, she says. Her saving grace is the goodwill she has earned at the Jangamwadi Math that gives her assignments once in a while. “Earlier, I would persist with customers. But today I don’t even care to ask if I see them with a fancy mobile. Everybody has a smartphone these days. Nobody needs a photographer,” says Ms. Sahani. Though Ms. Sahani loves the camera — she uses a Nikon D32 today — and would like to pursue it as a “passion” in the future, the sporadic earnings and falling demand has her worried. She also has to face lewd remarks and harassment on a daily basis. On one occasion, Ms. Sahani recalls, a man tried to break her camera after she got into an argument with him when he ridiculed her profession and made sexist remarks. Searching for greener pastures, Ms. Sahani, who comes from the Nishad caste, a backward community traditionally associated with riverine life, is now trying to go back to her roots — swimming. She has applied as a coach at the local Delhi Public School branch. The financial standing of her family has not been strong and that was the reason why she took up professional photography in the first place, a decade ago. Against the current Ms. Sahani’s family had run into a major financial crisis when her husband, who worked as a carpenter in Saudi Arabia, took to drink and began sending home very little money. She has two sons — 16 and 19 years old. For a time, Ms. Sahani worked as a swimming trainer at a local hotel (Nishads are often recruited as divers at the ghats to save people from drowning). Entrepreneurial spirit But the job was low-paid, seasonal and lacked security. She was looking at ways to make some extra income, when she encountered a man, who had migrated to Varanasi to set up a photography studio. “He came with a printer and set up his job here. It seemed hassle-free. I consulted a friend and we both thought if he can do it, why can’t we?” says Ms. Sahani. Along with her friend Baby Sahani, she soon invested in a printer and a simple camera, a Canon mini. Some borrowed money and mortgaging of her jewellery helped her purchase the equipment. Benevolent local photographers provided her the initial tips. The two women started out well but after a few months their relations soured and Ms. Sahani headed out on her own. By then, she had quit her job as a swimming trainer and was solely dependent on the camera. A class IX drop-out, Ms. Sahani also faced resistance from her husband, who despite gaining from her financial contributions, did not approve of her line of work. “He took it as an insult. And asked me who would take care of the kids? (one aged three and another only two months old then). But I was not one to back down,” she says with a smile.

The arrested were identified as M. Satyanarayana (35), resident of Kapparada area and A. Yugandhar (32) of Akkayapalem. Another accused Yellaji is at large. According to Arilova Inspector Tirupathi Rao, Satyanarayana and Yugandhar used to do some petty business in the past. Apart from petty business, Yugandhar also used to run a photo studio in the city. Yellaji, resident of Old Goshala, got acquainted with Yugandhar and his friend Satyanarayana at the photo studio. After demonetisation, the trio decided to print the new currency with the help of a colour printer and use them for their expenses. On Tuesday, Satyanarayana had given a fake 2,000 note to a petrol bunk for filling fuel. The petrol bunk authorities suspected some foul play and informed the police immediately, who rushed to the spot and took Satyanarayana into their custody. After preliminary enquiry, Satyanarayana revealed the names of two others. ""We have recovered the fake note and a few more of them, which were printed and ready to be distributed. In primary investigation, the accused revealed that they have not started circulating them in the city. However, we are yet to conduct an enquiry,"" said Tirupathi Rao.

  Following the crash in prices of toor in the open market, the State Cabinet has decided to procure the commodity from growers by paying a support price of ₹450 per quintal. With this, the farmers would get ₹5,500 per quintal of the pulse. Besides drought, the demonetisation of high value currencies has also adversely affected the procurement of the commodity in the market.

The Cabinet has also directed the State Food and Civil Supplies Department to procure the commodity at ₹5,500 per quintal. The Centre has fixed the Minimum Support Price for toor dal at ₹5,050.

According to the Japanese brokerage firm, normalised availability of cash may happen by February—March 2017, post which growth is expected to pick up. “We expect December wholesales to be impacted by a sharp decline in retail sales due to demonetisation,” Nomura said in a research note, adding that Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs) might go for inventory de—stocking to clear off 2016 model year inventory. The report further noted that “rural retails are impacted more (double—digit decline) compared to the urban segment, due to the liquidity crunch“.

Reuters 50 days after the government announced that these notes would cease to be legal tender, the Reserve Bank of India feels that the reasons behind the sudden announcement cannot be made public. The monetary policy regulator also refused to give any details about the time it will take to replenish the currency notes. “The query is in the nature of seeking future date of an event which is not defined as information as per Section 2(f) of the RTI Act,” RBI said in response to an RTI query. The central bank refused to disclose reasons behind the demonetisation of about Rs. 20 lakh crore of currency in the country citing Section 8(1)(a) of the Right to Information Act. The section states, “Information, disclosure of which would prejudicially affect the sovereignty and integrity of India, the security, strategic, scientific or economic interests of the State, relation with foreign State or lead to incitement of an offence.” Denying the information sought in the RTI application, the RBI did not give any reasons as to how exemption would apply in the given case as the decision was already taken and there was no way that disclosure of information would have fit in any of the reasons cited in section 8(1)(a) of the RTI Act. “The clause of public interest would apply where exemption clause applies on the information sought by an applicant. In the present case, the information sought does not attract any exemption clause,” former Central Information Commissioner Shailesh Gandhi told PTI. He said law is very clear that when a public authority rejects to disclose an information it must give clear reasons as to how the exemption clause would apply in the given case. Recently, it had refused to allow access to minutes of meetings held to decide on the issue of demonetisation of Rs. 1000 and Rs. 500 notes announced by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on November 8. Responding to an RTI application filed by activist Venkatesh Nayak, the RBI refused to disclose the minutes of the crucial meetings of Central Board of Directors on the issue of demonetisation citing section 8(1)(a) of the transparency law. Mr. Nayak said he will appeal against the decision, adding, while confidentiality prior to the making of the demonetisation decision is understandable, continued secrecy after the implementation of the decision is difficult to understand when crores of Indians are facing difficulties due to the shortage of cash in the economy. He said the refusal to disclose the minutes of the board meeting where the decision was taken is perplexing to say the very least. Mr. Gandhi also underlined that RBI has created an in-house “disclosure policy” which is against the letter and spirit of the RTI Act. Mr. Gandhi has also filed a complaint before the Central Information Commission against the RBI for adopting the policy.

| Photo Credit: SHIV KUMAR PUSHPAKAR The Right to Food Campaign has slammed “demonetisation” as a “reckless move” that “serves no clear purpose and is a major attack on the right to food and the right to life”. In a statement issued on Wednesday, the Right to Food Campaign, an informal network of individuals and organisations committed to the realisation of the right to food in India, said that economists of all persuasions have “exposed” the government’s claim that demonetisation would curb black money. Forgotten decisions Questioning the government’s seriousness about combating corruption, it observed that three years after the Lokpal Act came into force, no Lokpal has been appointed, the Whistleblowers Protection Act (passed in February 2014) awaits implementation, and the government is still to introduce the Grievance Redressal Bill. Pointing out that “it does not require a PhD in economics to understand that when the bulk of the population is strapped for cash, economic activity and employment take a dip,” it noted: “Farmers have been dumping vegetables on the roads for want of a remunerative price. Traders and vendors have seen their sales dive, often by 50 per cent or more. Sales of durable goods have crashed across the board. Construction activity has slowed own. And most importantly, workers have been laid off on a large scale.” Pension, wages woes Observing that pensioners and MGNREGA workers find it difficult to secure their pensions and wages at the best of times, it said: “Now, with the banking system jammed, millions of them are in danger of their lifeline being cut off for weeks or even months.” Calling upon the government to compensate the people for the hardships caused by demonetisation, the statement laid out a set of demands — an immediate increase in the annual budget of MGNREGA to Rs.60,000 crore with effect from 2016-17, increase of the Centre’s contribution to social security pension for widows, the elderly and the disabled persons from Rs.200 to Rs.1,000 per month, immediate implementation of the National Food Security Act provisions for universal maternity entitlements (Rs.6,000 per child), immediate central assistance for inclusion of milk, eggs and fruits in school mid-day meals and ICDS, immediate compensation for all families of victims of demonetisation-related deaths, and full disclosure of how, when, why and by whom the decision was made to demonetise. Food insecurity The right to food protects the rights of all humans to be free from hunger, food insecurity and malnutrition. It is derived from the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, to which India is a party.

(“Will PM quit if cash flow does not ease, asks Mamata”, Dec.28). In the past, Indira Gandhi, when Prime Minister, made tall promises such as “Health for all” and “Garibi Hatao”. But what happened? Did any one demand her resignation? Economic reforms to tackle black money and high-level corruption are not something that can show results overnight. All this is a gradual process with slow yet fruitful results. The economic reforms that were initiated by P.V. Narasimha Rao and Manmohan Singh, as joint efforts, are a good example of this. J.P.

Srinivasan, Secunderabad The exercise of demonetisation is fast losing its sheen. It is pathetic to see long queues outside bank ATMs even at unearthly hours. Because of a shortage of lower-denomination notes, commerce and trade has taken a beating. It is unfair to keep people guessing. Is the government clueless about what to do? V. Lakshmanan, Tirupur, Tamil Nadu Despite opinion in the form of write-ups and insights from experienced economists and thinkers, how can the Prime Minister continue to claim that demonetisation as a financial strategy has more supporters than dissenters? In a democracy, was he not bound to hear a section of opinion before he took such a decision? The 50-day timeline is an eyewash. One wonders if a new timeline is being scripted as part of the plot. The callousness displayed by the government towards the sufferings of the poor, daily wage earners and the illiterate smacks of arrogance while bordering on hostility towards “literate dissenters”. This is not ‘Achche din’. Anand Aravamudhan, Chennai It is now Ms. Banerjee who has taken over from the Congress to lead the Opposition flock against demonetisation. While the general opinion is that there are cracks in the so-called Opposition unity, the fact is that Ms. Banerjee is slowly testing her acceptance as a national leader.

The Finance Minister was likely hinting at the announcement of some sops that may be announced by Prime Minister Narendra Modi in his address to the nation on Saturday. Referring to the record search and seizures carried out by revenue sleuths since November 8, the Finance Minister said, “This only shows the mass-scale and manner in which some people have indulged in currency racketeering and by itself, justifies the Prime Minister’s decision of November 8.” “Already, yesterday I have gone around Delhi and we are getting reports from all over the country that the crowds at the banks have eased significantly. I would urge the media not to show 10 November photographs [of bank queues] on December 30,” Mr. Jaitley said, though he was non-committal about when withdrawal restrictions for bank account holders will be lifted. Assuring people that the Reserve Bank of India has a lot more stock of currency which it will continue to inject into banks and post offices, he said, “Till today, what was coming in recirculation was partly new currency and partly that which had ceased to be a legal tender. Now everything is new, so the banks will now have available the recirculated currency plus whatever the RBI is injecting.” “Wait a while… This is a market driven exercise as to how much currency is required” the Finance Minister said. Slamming the Opposition for predicting a lower growth rate in the economy, Mr. Jaitley said he hadn’t heard of any economic theory where lower growth translates into higher revenues. On Thursday, he had cited a 13.2 per cent growth in direct taxes till December 19 and a 26.2 per cent growth in indirect taxes till November 30. “Direct taxation is directly related to income and income is related to the economic environment and economic activity, so its expansion of economic activity which can lead to higher income. There are no additional taxes that have been imposed,” the Minister said. While custom duty collections have been modest, Mr. Jaitley said that this could be partly due to the imports of gold as well as capital goods coming down. But service tax and excise duty collections have risen and they reflect economic and manufacturing activity, he pointed out.

Thirumavalavan on Wednesday accused Prime Minister Narendra Modi of imposing demonetisation on the people and said that the move had disrupted the economy. The poor and the have-nots had been hit severely by demonetisation and the economic development had taken a back seat because of this precarious move on the part of the Centre. Speaking at the party’s “Constitution protection conference”, he said the recent development marked by the exit of the MDMK from the Peoples’ Welfare Front (PWF) was a direct fallout of the demonetisation move as differences of opinion had cropped up between Mr. Vaiko and other constituents of the front. Mr. Thirumavalavan said that when the PWF was formed there were strong rumours that the alliance would fall like a pack of cards. But the alliance remained intact. Although the constituent parties were shocked by Mr. Vaiko’s exit, the front would continue to exist, he said. Most people affected CPI (M) secretary G. Ramakrishnan said that about 90 per cent of the population in the country had been affected by demonetisation and 100 people had died due to its impact. The Dalits and the downtrodden were specifically affected because of the move while the affluent and major industrialists had been getting protection. Mr. Ramakrishnan said that a committee was formed by the United Progressive Alliance (UPA) in 2002 to eradicate black money. But the recommendations of the committee were rejected, he said. Demonetisation would never succeed and this had been evaluated to be a helpless strategy by the economic experts. In Puducherry, of the 29,000 shops, only 400 had been equipped with the point of sale machines. Hence, demonetisation was a step in the wrong direction, he added.

Assessment can be unreal but revenue is real,” Mr. Jaitley said, highlighting a 13.6 per cent rise in net direct tax collections till December 19. “Already a large part of benefits of this historic move are visible. A lot more money has come into the banking system… the ability of the banks to lend has now increased,” the Finance Minister said, adding that the remonetisation process had substantially advanced and there was no unrest reported in the country. “What comes into the banking system gets identified with the person and therefore its impact on taxation and revenue collection is already being seen,” Mr. Jaitley said.“The indirect tax figures are also available and notwithstanding what the critics had predicted in all the categories till November 30 there is a significant increase in indirect taxation,” he said, citing a 26.2 per cent rise in central indirect taxes collection till November 30. As per official data on tax collections released on December 9, net direct taxes grew 15.12 per cent between April and November this year, compared with the same period last year. The growth of indirect tax collections between April and October was 26.7 per cent. Overall crop sowing in the rabi season was up 6.3 per cent compared with last year, he said. “Now the rabi crop sowing has been higher than last year, life insurance businesses have increased, international tourism has increased, air passenger traffic has increased, petroleum consumption has increased, the flow into mutual funds has increased by 11 per cent,” Mr. Jaitley said. Many of these indicators, when taken together with the fact that the critical part of remonetisation was “already behind us,” suggested that things “should certainly be much better in the weeks and months to come than it was in the last six weeks.” The Reserve Bank of India had “very large amounts of currency available” and it would continue to support the market to the extent it needed liquidity, the Minister said. He said more ₹500 notes were also being released, so a lot of currency could be seen “coming into recirculation.” Corrections and Clarifications: This copy has been edited for a factual error.

1147,2016-12-30,53.0,"For Mangaluru?s fish sellers, demonetisation is the lesser worry","It is not demonetisation and the consequent cash crunch that Chandrakala and other fish sellers at the Jeppu fish market are worried about. For them, the main concern is the increase in door-to-door sale of fish. “Lately, we have been unable to sell even 50 per cent of the ₹2,000 worth of fish we bring here from the fishing harbour,” Ms. Chandrakala said. Like other sellers, she wants the Mangaluru City Corporation to ban door-to-door sale of fish. “We are greatly affected by line sales. Demonetisation has only added to our problems,” said Ms. Chandrakala, who is among the sellers who have stopped paying the monthly rent of ₹300 to the civic body. Her elder daughter studies in class 8, while her younger daughter is in class 5. “These are hard days I am facing ... I hope they will pass soon,” she said. Meenakshi, another seller, said it’s with great difficulty that she runs a family of four with the income from selling fish. She supplements this income by rolling beedis on the side. Low yield Part of the reason for the poor fish sales is the fall in yield. “It is usual during this period when the weather is chilly,” said Mahesh Kumar, the Deputy Director of Fisheries. The arrival of fish at the harbour was 18,000 tonnes and 17,819 tonnes in October and November, respectively. “Of this, 40 per cent is consumed by people,” Mr. Kumar said. Absence of change for ₹2,000 has been the other reason for poor sales. “The lack of change has forced us to turning away customers offering ₹2,000 notes,” said Ms. Meenakshi, a seller from Hampankatta. Sulochana Kotian, another seller, said they sometimes oblige customers by getting them change from those sellers who have done brisk business during the day. But the problems owing to demonetisation has subsided over the weeks, she added.

1148,2016-12-30,53.0,Demonetisation: Farmers left high and dry,"While urban areas in the State are adapting themselves to the changed scenario after the demonetisation of high-value notes, rural areas, especially farmers, continue to be under duress even 50 days after demonetisation. With no improvement in cash flow in villages, there are no takers for farmers’ produce. The fall in demand has triggered a drop in prices of agricultural produce. In Hassan district, many farmers have kept their stocks of potato, maize, ginger, and other crops as there are no buyers. As those who harvested potato in September/October got ₹16 a kg, the farmers who were harvesting the produce in November/December were hoping for a further increase in prices. But, much to their dismay, prices have crashed to ₹10 a kg. In this situation, many have not sold their produce. “Three truckloads of potato have remained unsold in our village,” said Papaiah, a farmer from Marenahalli near Mosale Hosahalli in Hassan taluk. But the stock has started to perish forcing some of them to sell at ₹4 a kg. The case of maize growers is no different. The price of maize has dropped to ₹1,300-1,400 a quintal from the level of ₹1,600-1,700 before demonetisation. Also, farmers have to bear transportation cost as traders have stopped farm-gate purchases after demonetisation in most of the areas. The coffee growers are also hit as demonetisation has coincided with the harvest season. A coffee planter with 25 acres of plantation needs to pay wages of about ₹45,000 a week as he hires about 25 labourers. But, one can only withdraw a maximum of ₹24,000 a week from the banks, say planters. U.M. Thirthamallesh, secretary of the Karnataka Coffee Growers’ Federation, says, “Because of the cash crisis, planters are hiring less number of workers this year, resulting in delayed picking, which may affect the quality of coffee beans, besides harming the plants in the long run.” In northern districts like Kalaburagi, farm labourers have started demanding a part of the harvested produce as their wages instead of accepting money, as several landlords are trying to give them old currency notes. What has added to the woes of farmers is that most of the ATMs in rural areas have remained closed due to paucity of cash.

1149,2016-12-30,53.0,Demonetisation presents an opportunity,"Penalty for holding the demonetised currency.
  A flailing Congress party, after suffering several electoral defeats in many State elections since 2014, has narrowed its focus on to pro-poor and agrarian issues as a way to shore up popular support, a strategy that predated the elections and adopted earlier this decade. The demonetisation issue has given the party an opening to pursue this strategy in a more concrete manner. On Congress Foundation Day, December 28, party vice-president Rahul Gandhi sent out a clear, unequivocal message to Prime Minister Narendra Modi: his demonetisation decision, far from securing the future of the country’s most vulnerable sections — as he was claiming in his well-publicised, almost-without-a-pause speeches — had actually devastated their lives. In a brief speech at the Congress headquarters, he asked Mr. Modi to quantify both the economic losses to the country since November 8, as well as spell out how many on the margins had lost livelihoods and, some, even lives. “Demonetisation was done,” the Congress’s vice-president said, “for 50 families at the expense of the poor, small farmers and shopkeepers and the youth.” He then went on to demand that the government waive all agricultural loans, pay a 20 per cent bonus for farm produce, give all BPL Poverty Line) women ₹25,000, double MGNREGA wages and waive half the income tax and sales tax dues of small shopkeepers.  Fifty days after 86 per cent of the country’s currency notes were outlawed at one stroke, the mood in the country is gradually turning sour. Mr. Gandhi’s demands were, therefore, perfectly timed, pointing out that it was time people paused and figured out who had gained and who had lost through the demonetisation exercise. Equally significant, his message was also in tune with the politics he has been working towards for the last few years, manifestations of which have been visible since 2011. That year, he had stood in solidarity with farmers in western Uttar Pradesh, in Tappal and Bhatta-Parsaul, who were battling land acquisition. In 2014-’15, he led his party’s battle to ensure that the Congress-led United Progressive Alliance’s people-friendly land acquisition law was not changed beyond recognition by the Modi government: the Congress and supporting Opposition parties won that round. More recently, ahead of the Uttar Pradesh polls slated for next year, the centrepiece of his kisan yatra was a promise to waive all farm loans if the Congress is voted to power. But if there was a clear emphasis in all these actions, there was one problem: just as he did not follow through his U.P. agitation till the 2012 polls, his recent kisan yatra just petered out in mid-October. Mr. Gandhi’s inability to sustain an agitation, even when successful, has been his besetting sin. In 2004, the Congress had countered the BJP’s “Shining India” message with an expansive catchphrase: “Congress ka haath, aam aadmi ke saath.” The aam aadmi was a nebulous figure, but the description resonated not just with the dispossessed and the poor but also struck a chord with the aspirational and, indeed, even swathes of the middle class.The new line worked for the Congress in two successive general elections in 2004 and 2009. But by 2012, the image and fortunes of the UPA government it led began to take a hit. At the AICC session in Delhi on January 17, 2014, Mr. Gandhi had stressed the need to create a “support base” for the 70 crore Indians who had risen above the poverty line but not yet entered the middle class. He travelled across the country, repeating his concern for “the hands that build the nation” promising them a “new future,” not through handouts but “a basic rights and welfare package” that would go beyond the Unorganised Workers’ Social Security Act of 2008. The Congress’s analysis was: one, if most political parties look at voters through the prism of caste or religion, governments divide citizens into BPL and Above Poverty Line (APL). Two, with successive attempts to define BPL turning controversial, and implementation of welfare programmes proving to be less than satisfactory, the government had moved to universal entitlements with exclusions (those who are income tax payees, own a car etc. are not eligible for such benefits). In operational terms, BPL had been phased out. Three, economic liberalisation had increased job opportunities, fuelling migration to cities and swelling the unorganised sector. This sector may have benefited from health, homes and food entitlements, but labour laws did not apply to it. Four, the Congress, using literature on the subject, had calculated that Indians who earned between ₹1,000-₹15,000 per head per month, and fall in this in-between category — christened NRMB (not rich, not middle class, not BPL) for in-house discussion — numbered 70 crore. By engaging with this section — railway porters, rickshaw wallas, saltpan workers, fishermen, farmers etc. — not defined by caste or religion but by income and aspiration, Mr. Gandhi sought to build a new constituency for the Congress that has seen its core constituencies being eroded steadily over the years. Unfortunately, in 2014, the Congress suffered an ignominious defeat in the general election. But its losses had nothing to do with the direction in which Mr. Gandhi was seeking to take the party; rather, the mood created by Anna Hazare’s anti-corruption campaign provided a perfect launch pad for the BJP that year. But, today, the ill-effects of demonetisation have provided the Opposition — of which the Congress is the largest party — an opportunity to change the narrative to its own advantage. Parliament’s recent winter session saw an unusual degree of solidarity among Opposition parties on the issue, and if West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee had seized the initiative initially, by the end, Mr. Gandhi was well on his way to helming the Opposition’s efforts to corner the government. Unfortunately, he stumbled, not realising that his going with his party colleagues to meet the Prime Minister on the farm loan waiver issue on December 16, would be read as breaking ranks. The other Opposition parties are so annoyed that most of them boycotted his December 27 meeting intended to plan how to carry forward the battle jointly. Mr. Gandhi’s heart may be in the right place, but he continues to falter on consistency and credibility, and an understanding of how the political game is played. But, it's still not too late for the Congress vice-president to change his advisers. smita.g@thehindu.co.in Printable version | Jan 7, 2017 1:49:27 AM | http://www.thehindu.com/opinion/columns/Demonetisation-presents-an-opportunity/article16960245.ece © The Hindu We sipped on turmeric lattes, geeked out on coffee and dug up our own potatoes.

   Jammu and Kashmir Finance Minister Haseeb Drabu on Saturday said while demonetisation has caused short—term pains to the people, its long—term impact is going to be far more important than what is seen at the moment. “There are two ways about it, one is a very short—term kind of interpretation where it has caused a lot of distress in terms of transactional demand for money has not been met,” Drabu told reporters here. “But I take a slightly more long—term view and feel that this is going to set us on a path of much superior digital payment system and (comes) also as a shock to the system which should eventually yield better results. So, I am not negative on it but yes there have been short—term pains,” he said. The minister further said that the long—term impact of demonetisation is going to be far more important than what is being see at the moment. The State Finance Minister was here to unveil the Jammu and Kashmir Bank’s calendar for 2017. Asked whether he and Chief Minister Mehbooba Mufti were not on the same page over the issue demonetisation as the latter has praised the Centre’s move, Drabu said he speaks as a professional, while the CM has given a general opinion about it. “Why should one be (on the same page)? I mean demonetisation is a national macro—economic policy measure. It will affect different people differently. I take a view which is professional,” the minister added. Acknowledging that they can have different views on the same matter, Drabu said: “She was giving a general opinion about it. But even then I do not feel any dissonance“. The finance minister who will be presenting his third budget next week, said, he would continue with some of the reform measures. “Last year, I did a lot of reforms on provident fund. This year also, I will continue doing some reforms...basic trend of my budget has been to make things easier for the people and finance should not be seen as a constraining department, but something that aides development. “But, because I presented the last budget in July (2016) its been only six months and I think this budget will also consolidate and do a stock taking of the previous three budgets. It means a lot” he said. Unveiling the banks calendar which focuses on the achievement of youth from the state, the minister said “it is great in terms of its timeliness as the counter—narrative that exists today in the world is that we have a world champion (eight—year old kick boxing champion Tajamul Islam) coming out of Kashmir.” “The biggest challenge that J&K as a state faces is youth. The image that today is...a youth who has lost its way. The first image that will come to your mind today is of a youth pelting stones, anarchy, social disorder. I do not think it is a political problem. It is a social issue,” the minister said.

1151,2016-12-31,54.0,Chandy links blacklisted UK currency printer?s re-entry to demonetisation,"Former Kerala Chief Minister Oommen Chandy. File photo
   Former Kerala Chief Minister Oommen Chandy on Saturday cast doubt on the re-emergence of a previously blacklisted British company, a currency printing major, in India around the time Prime Minister Narendra Modi launched the demonetisation drive. Thomas de la Rue, one of the three foreign firms contracted by the Reserve Bank of India in 1997-98 to print 360 crore currency notes of Rs. 500 and Rs. 100 denominations with an aggregate value of Rs. 1 lakh crore, was reportedly blacklisted by the Union Home Ministry in 2011, he told the media, citing a set of documents including news reports. In a report in 2012-13, the Public Undertakings Committee of Parliament — then headed by Congress’ Jagadambika Pal, who has since joined the BJP — expressed serious reservations about the RBI’s unprecedented move in 1997-98 to outsource currency printing to foreign firms, maintaining that it risked currency falling in the hands of “unscrupulous elements like terrorists, extremists and other economic offenders…” “There is no mention of de la Rue’s activities in India in its annual reports of years 2013, 2014 and 2015, but its annual report of 2016 clearly mentions the India operations of de la Rue Cash Processing Solutions India Pvt Ltd and de la Rue India Pvt Ltd. In a recent interview to a journal, Martin Southerland, chief executive of de la Rue, says that the company has set up an office in Delhi and its senior management is working closely with the Union Department for Industrial Policy and Promotion (DIPP). He further speaks about its potential role in the ‘Make In India’ initiative. There’s also evidence to show that the company’s share value rose by 33.33 per cent after April 11, 2016,” Mr. Chandy said. He also called into question the company’s involvement as one of the Platinum Partners in the India-U.K. Tech Summit held in Delhi in early November. In the wake of news reports suggesting that the RBI had selected a few foreign firms including de la Rue to print plastic currency notes of Rs. 10 denomination to bring liquidity to market, Union Minister of State for Finance Arjun Ram Meghwal informed the Parliament on December 9, 2016 that plastic currency printing had begun at a foreign firm. “I would urge the Government of India to explain the nature of its close partnership with a company earlier blacklisted by the Union Home Ministry. Has the government taken any step to get plastic money printed by a foreign company sidestepping the PUC’s strong recommendation against the practice? If the government denies having any ties with the blacklisted firm, would it launch an investigation into the firm’s full-scale resurgence in India,” Mr. Chandy asked. Urging the media to probe the issue further, he said it would be brought to the notice of the party’s central leadership.

— PHOTO: S.S. KUMAR The Congress on Friday termed the demonetisation of higher denomination currency notes as a “complete failure.” Congress leader and Member of Parliament Rajeev Gowda told presspersons here that the demonetisation could not achieve any of the stated objectives. The amount of demonetised currency that had come into the banking system suggested that the black money hoarded was only about 5 to 6 per cent and not 20 to 25 per cent as projected. The bulk of the black money had been invested in foreign land and real estate business. The ban on higher denomination notes had not yielded any results, he said. “The country and the people are in distress after 50 days of the exercise,” he said. The ban, besides causing hardship to the public, had resulted in slow down in trade, loss of job, and reduction in farm activity. The economic growth potential had fallen due to the ban on currency notes, he said. Things had come to a stage where only a trader with a point of sale machine could do business. Many marginal traders had lost their business because of non-availability of PoS machines. Buyers were now going to shopping malls, he added. “The Prime Minister has failed to understand the intricacies of the Indian economy. The BJP government has reversed the average growth of 7.6 per cent achieved during 10 years of UPA rule,” he said. Mr. Rajeev Gowda accused the National Democratic Alliance of undermining the authority of institutions such as the Reserve Bank of India. Chief Minister V. Narayanasamy said after the Centre announced the withdrawal of Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,000 currency notes, several small scale industrial units had shut shop. He questioned the rational behind introducing new Rs. 2,000 notes after demonetising higher denomination notes. Minister for Public Works and Puducherry Pradesh Congress Committee president A.

Since people continue to suffer, what kind of punishment Mr. Modi would like to face, AICC spokesman P.C. Chacko sought to know as the deadline expired on Friday. Ninety-nine per cent of the people were suffering, 110 persons died while waiting in queues for withdrawing their own money from banks, and demonetisation proved to be a miserable failure, Mr. Chacko said at a press conference here. He demanded that the Prime Minister lift all controls on withdrawal of money from banks. Only 5.76 lakh crore out of 16.6 lakh crore currency notes (out of which Rs.500 and Rs.1,000 notes accounted for 14.6 lakh crore) had been replaced. “This means, two-thirds of notes are not in circulation,” he said. The objectives Mr. Modi cited for demonetising high-value notes had not been achieved since the number of terrorists was on the rise and black money was not unearthed on a large scale. “This is because only six per cent of the wealth of black money holders is in cash,” he said The plan to remove fake currency too failed going by the RBI statement that after demonetisation of 14.6 lakh crore currency notes, 14 lakh crore notes had been deposited in banks. The Congress had taken up a campaign in support of the people who were suffering due to demonetisation, he said and added that the party would organise demonstrations in front of Collectorates in all districts on January 6 and the Mahila Congress would conduct protest programmes in all districts on January 9.

  Even as the city goes into a celebration mode to herald New Year, the last few days have given anxious moments to event managers, hotels and business establishments with an overall drop in sales and a dull response to New Year’s eve events as an effect of demonetisation. Queries are coming in for the event at The Park but a very few have materialised into real transactions. “Last year we hosted a crowd of 1,000 people. But the overall sentiments have been affected this time. Saturday will be a crucial day for us to see the final response,” said Sadiq Rizvi, the hotel’s food and beverage manager. The hotel, however, is planning its New Year’s eve party on the usual grand scale with the Reveillon Rio theme and the special highlight will be a laser show. For the first time Vizag will see a 24 watt laser show performance,” said Ajit Singh Garcha, the hotel’s general manager. At The Gateway, preparations are in full swing to host ‘Samvatsara’ - the New Year’s eve party. But the underlying worry is palpable. According to Kiran Bussari, general manager of The Gateway, the sale of passes this year has not been encouraging. “We are keeping our fingers crossed and gearing up for the big bash,” he added. This time, several mid-segment hotels are keeping the celebrations on a low key going by the overall gloomy market sentiments. One of the business hotels that earlier planned to host a party at Vizag Convention Madhurawada had to cancel the plan due to low patronage. Small and big business establishments echo a similar story. For wholesale flower vendors, New Year’s eve is one of the biggest revenue generating periods in the year. But this year, their sales have plummeted by over 80 per cent. “It has been the worst phase for us in the past decade. Last year same day, we sold flowers worth Rs. 40,000 on a single day. I somehow did a sale of Rs 7,000 on Friday. On Saturday, too, we are not that hopeful of making up for the loss,” said T. Gemini, a wholesale flower dealer who has kept a stall on the footpath near Dutt Island.

In addition, 37 kg gold, 15 kg gold jewellery and 10.87 kg silver were seized from various violators during this period. The data is for seizures between November 10, two days after old Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,000 notes ceased to be legal tender, and December 29. The seized cash was in both old and new notes. The biggest seizure, of Rs.3 crore, was made on November 25. On December 6, 16 kg gold concealed in diapers was seized from a group of passengers. Six filers, including two infants, were a part of the group that had arrived from Dubai. Tax evasion “In many of these instances, the tax evasion angle is being probed,” said a CISF officer. Unaccounted foreign currency was also intercepted, with USD 105300 and 10500 Euros among the major detections. The cash detected at the Mumbai airport during the same period was nearly two and a half times that of Delhi. Similarly, gold detected there was nearly four times the figure reported in the Capital. The consolidated national figures are Rs. 64.36 crore in cash, a whopping three tons of gold and nearly 38 kg silver.

1156,2016-12-31,54.0,?Rise in tax revenues not linked to demonetisation?,"Responding to Finance Minister Arun Jaitley’s statement that tax revenues had increased despite demonetisation, senior Congress leader P. Chidambaram said on Friday that this was expected as the government allowed people to use the illegal tender to pay taxes. He, however, cautioned that tax revenue had nothing to do with GDP growth, which would fall even according to the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) assessment. “Going by the budget papers and numbers put out by the Finance Minister, increase in direct taxes is more or less as projected in the budget papers,” he told the media. “Increase in indirect taxes is to be a considerable extent attributed to the increase in levies on petroleum, diesel and petroleum products. I will, however, concede that some boost in tax revenues may have happened because once you say that illegal tender can be used to pay taxes, people will obviously seize the opportunity to pay arrears of taxes by using tender that has been declared illegal.” He said Mr. Jaitley should ask the RBI whether GDP growth would fall. “Numerous analysts and agencies have predicted that the GDP will take a hit. Even the RBI has said that the GDP will take a hit by 0.5 per cent,” Mr. Chidambaram said. He underlined that even a one per cent GDP hit meant a hit of Rs. 1.5 lakh crore. Mr. Chidambaram also questioned the argument that demonetisation had hit terror funding. “In Jammu and Kashmir, since September 30, when the surgical strike happened, 33 security personnel have lost their lives and, as on December 25, the death toll of security personnel in 2016 is 87, which is double the death toll of 2015,” he said. Disagreeing with the contention that people were happy, he said, “I think there is a mistake in assuming that people who are patient are not angry.” Mr. Chidambaram said that no country could be cashless, adding that while it was a good idea to make high-value transactions in the digital mode, the same was a bad idea when pushed for low-value transactions. He said there were privacy issues of cashless transactions, wondering why the state should know whether people were spending on liquor, tobacco, lingerie or condoms. Saying that it was expected that Prime Minister Narendra Modi would announce removal of restrictions on withdrawing money from banks on Saturday, Mr. Chidambaram demanded that the Centre make public the agenda note and minutes of the meeting of the RBI Board of Governors on November 8 and the Cabinet note of that day. He said that just three RBI directors — just four of the 14 posts had been filled — met for half an hour on November 8, after which a recommendation was sent to the Cabinet that passed it.

1157,2016-12-31,54.0,Demonetisation effect: State detects misuse of milk incentives,"As a result of demonetisation, pilferage of the State’s resources, by milk producers from border areas of neighbouring States,has now come to light and been eliminated. Milk societies, which were paying ₹4 a litre incentive to Karnataka farmers upfront on delivery of milk, implemented strict payment norms in November and migrated to online transfer through Real Time Gross Settlement (RTGS). This exposed many fake beneficiaries who are not residents of Karnataka. “We noticed this misuse of incentive money in Kalaburagi region. Milk suppliers from Telangana region benefited incentives provided by the government,” Animal Husbandry Minister A. Manju said. The State government is assessing gains post demonetisation and loss incurred after incentives were announced, which is expected to run into several hundred crores of rupees. The department has detected a similar pattern of incentive misuse in other borders areas such as Belagavi and Dakshina Kannada and has instructed all 14 milk unions to link milk producers bank accounts to Aadhaar cards. Now, with the linkage of bank accounts with Aadhaar, only milk suppliers of the State will get incentive money provided by the government, Mr. Manju said. Karnataka has around 8.91 lakh milk producers. The State government disperses about ₹45 crore a month in the form of incentives to milk suppliers.

1158,2016-12-31,54.0,50 days of demonetisation,"  I disagree with the Minister that the exercise has been successful (“Jaitley sees green shoots after demonetisation”, Dec.30). It seems as though everyone except those with black money have been put through misery. While some have managed to happily get hundreds or thousands of Rs.2,000 notes, others have struggled to get one or two Rs.2,000 notes even after standing for hours in serpentine queues outside banks and ATMs. Without assistance from bankers, it is impossible for corrupt people to acquire such large amounts of money in new notes. This in itself is sufficient to show that corruption still thrives despite the Prime Minister’s promise to eradicate it. And what right does the government have to impose curbs on the quantum of money to be withdrawn from our own accounts? It looks like it will take at least another three months to restore normalcy. The government has constantly changed its tune — from eradicating black money to counterfeit notes to transforming the economy into a cashless one. I hope the Prime Minister doesn’t aspire for a second term. V.V.N. Murthy, Hyderabad   People may suffer due to demonetisation but many still like the Prime Minister for attempting to unearth black money and eradicate corruption. Every Indian is interested to hear the Prime Minister’s speech on New Year’s eve. Let this be telecast in all languages. I pity those politicians who oppose Mr. Modi just for the sake of opposing him. R. Ganesan, Chennai   Demonetisation has drawn resentment from all quarters. People feel the government did not do its homework before making the announcement. It is now a sit-and-watch game.

1159,2017-01-01,55.0,Demonetisation alters economy?s recovery path: experts,"The Centre’s demonetisation move has hurt private consumption and impacted sectors such as real estate, automobiles and FMCG, which in turn has altered the economy’s recovery path in the short-term, economists said. But it could yield some benefits in the medium to long-term, provided follow-up measures are taken and there’s no return to an era of inspectors and tax terrorism, according to economists. “One big reason for the slowdown post-demonetisation is that it came in at a time when the spending cycles should have started, which have now slowed down on account of the shortage of currency, which has affected quite a few industries especially consumer goods, automobiles, real estate, FMCG goods, and textiles,” Madan Sabnavis, chief economist at Care Ratings told The Hindu. “Several sectors that rely on household consumption have gotten affected by demonetisation so therefore there will be a push-back on the overall growth of industry.” Mr. Sabnavis added that even spending by the farming community, which was expected to pick up due to the higher kharif output and the stronger monsoon, has gotten squeezed due to despair sales taking place because of the unavailability of cash and the fact that all mandi transactions are carried out in cash. “The sector-specific immediate effects of demonetisation have been mostly negative,” Rajiv Kumar, Senior Fellow at the Centre for Policy Research said. “Demand has taken a hit, whether it is in automobiles, motorcycles, real estate, or construction. Except, of course, as the Finance Minister pointed out on Thursday, unexpectedly, the airlines have shown improvement.” In the run-up to the demonetisation announcement on November 8, private sector investment was on the cusp of a recovery on the back of recovering household demand, easing inflation, and the boost to agriculture due to the stronger monsoon. This momentum has since been lost, and will likely begin to return only in the next financial year. “It looked like consumer spending would continue to improve in October and November and so private investment could pick up,” Mr. Sabnavis said. “But that is something that has gotten thwarted.” “Private investment prior to demonetisation was subdued, but we were on the precipice of seeing something happening,” Mr. Sabnavis added. “A major reason investment is not taking place is because we have surplus capacity. We have surplus capacity because there is low demand for products. So if demand picks up then capacity utilisation can improve and that’s when you go in for fresh investment.” Mr. Kumar, however, believed that demonetisation will have medium-to-long term benefits for the economy as an increasing share of economic activity gets formalised, not to mention the message such a policy move will send against corruption and black-money hoarders. “If this move has been successful in capturing a part of the informal, black economy, which is estimated to be 40 per cent of GDP, those numbers will now be reflected in the formal GDP numbers, so that will likely lead to an increase in the growth numbers,” Mr. Kumar said. “So, the effect could be an uptick in the GDP numbers in the third or fourth quarter.” “However, its success will be dependent on the follow-up measures which have to be persistent and yet not heavy-handed, so that we don’t need an emergence of ‘inspector raj’ or tax terrorism in the country,” Mr. Kumar added.

Talking to mediapersons here on Sunday, Mr. Chandy said the much-awaited address to the nation by Prime Minister Narendra Modi after completion of the 50-day limit he had put to set right the disruption caused by demonetisation was a total disappointment to the people as there was no mention about demonetisation, its rate of success in achieving its original goals or the steps being taken to alleviate the people’s misery. ‘Different solutions’ “The Prime Minister talked about the patience of the people, but did not mention the 115 persons who had died on account of the misery. He did not say when the misery would end. It only shows that the situation has gone out of the Prime Minister’s control. Different regions are facing different crises and they need separate sets of strategies to overcome them. For example, in Kerala, it is the cooperative sector which needs assistance. In other States, it would be different,” he said. He wanted the Prime Minister to take the Chief Ministers into confidence to tackle the crisis. “This is a federal State and the Prime Minister has to deal with the situation in a democratic way,” Mr Chandy said. Mr. Chandy also wanted a response from the Central authorities on the issues he had raised regarding the re-emergence of De La Rue. He said he had informed the Central leadership of the party about the issue. “I had done nearly 10 days of homework on this. There is nothing new in what I have raised,” he said. But the Report of the Public Undertakings Committee of Parliament, the company’s annual report, media reports and the interview given by the company official, when read together, give rise to serious questions, he added.

K.V.S. GIRI  Whether views of the Chief Economic Advisor and the Finance Minister were taken before the sudden announcement of demonetisation of high-value currency notes by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on November 8? The Reserve Bank of India feels this query cannot be answered under the Right to Information Act as it does not comes under the definition of information under the transparency law. The applicant wanted to know whether the “views of Chief Economic Advisor Arvind Subramaniam and Finance Minister Arun Jaitley were taken before announcement was made”. “Query is in the nature of seeking opinion from CPIO which is not defined as information as per Section 2(f) of the RTI Act,” the RBI said in response to an RTI query. Asked whether the information sought will fall under “seeking opinion” from the CPIO, former Chief Information Commissioner A.N. Tiwari said, “No. It does not. It is a fact sought by an RTI applicant. The CPIO cannot say an opinion has been sought from him.” “How it can be called seeking opinion? Whether someone was consulted or not is a matter of record. Had the question been that should views be taken then it would mean taking opinion,” former Information Commissioner Shailesh Gandhi said, expressing surprise at the response of RBI Central Public Information Officer. The definition of information covers “any material in any form, including records, documents, memos, emails, opinions, advices, press releases, circulars, orders, logbooks, contracts, reports, papers, samples, models, data material held in any electronic form and information relating to any private body which can be accessed by a public authority under any other law for the time being in force”. The query was also sent to the Prime Minister’s Office and the Finance Ministry but it remained unanswered even after 30 days of filing of the RTI application. The applicant had also sought to know the designation and the names of officials who were consulted before scraping of old Rs. 500 and Rs. 1000 currency notes. “The information sought relates to sensitive matters pertaining to discontinuation/withdrawal of bank notes. The information is exempt from disclosure under Section 8(1)(a) and (g) of RTI Act,” the RBI said. The monetary policy regulator also did not disclose if the decision to demonetise currency notes worth Rs 20 lakh crore was opposed by any official or minister, saying the information sought is “hypothetical” in nature. It also cited Section 8(1)(a) of the RTI Act to deny minutes of deliberations related to demonetisation. Section 8(1)(a) of the RTI Act exempts from disclosure the information which would prejudicially affect the sovereignty and integrity of India, the security, strategic, scientific or economic interests of the State, relation with foreign State or lead to incitement of an offence. Information sought under Section 8(1)(g) would endanger the life or physical safety of any person or identify the source of information or assistance given in confidence for law enforcement or security purposes. The RBI has been denying information related to crucial aspects related to demonetisation citing exemption clauses. It recently refused to give reasons behind the demonetisation move.  RBI refuses to give reasons behind demonetisation Earlier, it had denied to Mumbai-based RTI Activist Anil Galgali information about distribution of currency to banks between November 9, 2016 and November 19, 2016 citing Section 8(1)(g) of the RTI Act. The central bank did not give any reason as to how this section would apply in the case of information sought by Mr. Galgali. RTI Activist Venkatesh Nayak, who was also denied deliberations on demonetisation by the RBI, said: “While confidentiality prior to announcing the demonetisation decision is understandable, continued secrecy after its implementation is difficult to understand when people are facing problems due to shortage of cash.” He said the refusal to disclose the minutes of the board meeting where the decision was taken is “perplexing”.

1162,2017-01-01,55.0,Another bank under lens in currency case,"Thousands of bank accounts in different parts of the country have come under the scanner of the enforcement agencies like the I-T Dept, ED and the CBI for suspicious transactions after Nov. 8.
  The Income Tax Department may get a case registered with the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) to investigate allegations that demonetised currency notes of ₹120 crore were illegally exchanged using certain accounts with the Jain Cooperative Bank here. Income Tax officials searched the premises of bank executives earlier this week, following a tip-off that Reserve Bank of India (RBI) guidelines on exchange of old notes had been violated and certain people had recycled cash using fraudulent accounts. Transaction records of the bank, post-demonetisation, are also being scrutinised. The agencies also suspect that some bank officials got their own cash of about ₹3.5 crore exchanged with the notes available with the bank. Fraudulent action The case was detected after Vinay Jain, a resident of Gandhi Nagar in east Delhi, lodged a complaint with the Daryaganj police on December 2 alleging that some unknown persons found at least nine savings account at the Jain Cooperative Bank showing him as a witness, without his knowledge. According to the FIR, the account numbers 21456 to 21464 were opened showing Mr. Jain as a witness. The complainant alleged a criminal conspiracy. “I had gone to the bank for some personal work when I came to know that some accounts had been opened projecting me as a witness. When I asked the bank officials to share the details, they refused to divulge any information. I called up the Police Control Room for assistance. An area police officer enquired the matter with the bank officials, following which they told me that nine such accounts had been opened,” Mr. Jain told The Hindu. He lodged a complaint with the police seeking action against those involved. Scary prospect “At the time they shared the details, these accounts had a cumulative balance of about ₹20 lakh. They were opened soon after the demonetisation move was announced on November 8. I received calls from several persons who tried to dissuade me from pursuing the matter. Had I not lodged the complaint, one day the agencies would have knocked at my door thinking I am the culprit,” he said. Thousands of bank accounts in different parts of the country have come under the scanner of the enforcement agencies like the Income-Tax Department, Enforcement Directorate and the CBI for suspicious transactions after November 8.

Narayana on Saturday said the demonetisation move of Prime Minister Narendra Modi had hit the poor hard and it was implemented with an utmost dictatorial mood. Mr. Narayana alleged that the Prime Minister had leaked out his plan to demonetise high-value currency to various corporate barons. He told presspersons that the entire exercise had hit the poor hard and sought to know how the government planned to eliminate black money without focusing on the wealth stashed abroad in various other forms. Mr. Modi had not eliminated corruption or black money since black money had been converted into white money through various other modes, he said. The demonetisation move was an injurious measure and the CPI had decided to launch nationwide agitation from January 3 to condemn the pro-rich and pro-corporate policies of the Centre. The CPI demanded the Centre to sanction ex gratia relief to those who had died while waiting in queues in front of the banks and ATMs in different parts of the country, post demonetisation.

1164,2017-01-02,56.0,"People and patience, post-demonetisation","Illustration: Sreejith R.Kumar
  Patience is hardly an attribute that is associated with the Indian psyche, particularly of the male variety. Instances of road rage at the slightest pretext leading even to death are far too common. A flock is way more common a formation than a queue. Even if a queue is to be formed, violators run amok in total disregard of the conscientious and often the geriatric in the waiting. The urban phenomenon of delirious honking is another manifestation of patience running thin. The recent past, however, has thrown up a remarkable exception, namely, the general attitude in demonetised India. As we near the two-month mark, a consensus seems to be emerging among economists, from both sides of the ideological spectrum, that demonetisation will lead to significantly lower real GDP growth in the transition phase than expected but will have no effect in the long run. Estimates from academics and financial analysts suggest that demonetisation may lead to a decrease in annual real GDP growth of anything between 1 and 2 percentage points than expected. One of the many crucial assumptions of course is that the national accounting norm remains the same. Irrespective of what the exact number is, evidence suggests that demonetisation has left behind a trail of economic consequences in terms of job loss and diminished economic activity, particularly in the informal sector, and will continue to do so in the near future. Besides the pure economic cost, the psychological cost of having to wait in serpentine queues for a couple of thousand rupees is enormous. And queueing up may not yield rewards anyway as ATMs continue to run dry, especially in the semi-urban and rural areas. Initial reports suggested that the queues in the second month have been significantly shorter than those in the first. Now it seems the shorter queues have a different explanation — people have a fair sense of how long cash will last, if at all, and rational that they are, do not wait if they think their turn will not come. All this for their own money, and this makes demonetisation even more exasperating and psychologically costly. For the pain that has thus been inflicted, the aam aadmi has shown extraordinary restraint and patience. There has been no major threat to public order despite considerable hardship, there has been no major protest, let alone violent ones. This is quite unlike other instances of sudden and unexpected economic downturn across the world — the Argentinian riots in 1989 were largely attributed to sustained hyperinflation. The 1991 structural adjustments-driven economic reforms in India led to considerable labour unrest in the mid-1990s. The Arab Spring, which promised to change the political landscape in West Asia earlier in the decade, was partly attributed to the widespread unemployment and economic hardship of the Arab youth. Further, research suggests that negative income shock across the world leads to greater conflict — in fact even scarcity of rainfall, which is entirely natural and thus exogenous, has been found to have a strong effect on violence and conflict in India. It is remarkable that the overall sentiment post-demonetisation continues to be largely positive, despite its obvious immediate economic impact. So much so that there is hardly any wind in the Opposition’s sails. The moot question is, why. Some have argued that the idea of sacrifice is seen as the hallmark of Indian civilisation and the current dispensation has effectively appealed to it. It has given an impression that any act that is critical of demonetisation is in effect a violation of the spirit of sacrifice, which is an elemental part of our history and culture. But this is only partly true. While sacrifice in itself provides a moral tone, sacrifice for a greater common good offers the temporal foundation. And that temporal foundation was initially to eliminate black money and it is now to engender a cashless society. But that is not all. The government and its social media allies have gone a step further to situate demonetisation on the tried and tested plank of nationalism. So a dissent to demonetisation is being treated as a dissent to the idea of Indian nation state. So much so that the Indian military, which till now had been the most luminous emblem in the pantheon of nationalism, has been replaced, however temporarily, by the bank teller. The automatic tellers have been rendered substantially ineffective, and the hard-working, resilient and ever-alert human tellers have been accorded the status of the jawan. An unfortunate death in the ranks of bank personnel has been conveniently co-opted into the narrative of martyrdom. It is true that the cashless, opinion-making, upper-middle India has not faced the brunt of demonetisation. But even the section of the people that has been directly hit as a result of the policy, has displayed an impressive composure, often found wanting on other occasions. Understanding how human behaviour can be changed is a fascinating academic discipline. Much advances have been made here in the recent past, but none as spectacular as the effect of a generous dose of nationalism, however devoid that idea may be of the very people who constitute the nation.

1165,2017-01-02,56.0,Demonetisation plays ?spoiler? on auto sales,"Amid “short-term headwinds” in the auto industry post-demonetisation, auto majors such as Hyundai Motor India and Mahindra & Mahindra posted a decline in their domestic sales in December 2016. On the other hand, Tata Motors, Volkswagen and Renault had registered a growth in sales during the last month. Analysts are in a wait and watch mode for the last quarter of 2015-16 as some feel that the retail impact of demonetisation on car sales will be reflected in the January-March period. However, the impact can be mitigated to some extent by the positive consumer sentiment, particularly if some sops are announced in the Budget. Market leader Maruti Suzuki had said on Saturday that domestic sales had fallen 4.4 per cent to 1,06,414 units in last month from 1,11,333 units in December 2015, the company said. “While retail demand for our products was strong, our wholesale (numbers) in December are as per plans made at the start of the year,” the company’s Executive Director (Marketing & Sales) R.S. Kalsi said. Hyundai Motor India said its domestic sales fell 4.3 per cent in December to 40,057 units from 41,861 units in the same month previous year. For Ford India, domestic sales declined by 6.04 per cent to 5,566 units. ‘Uncertainty abounds’ “As we move in 2017, the industry does face some short-term headwinds, given the uncertainty regarding the impact of demonetisation and GST, while the medium to long-term outlook continues to be positive,” Anurag Mehrotra, Executive Director, Marketing, Sales & Service at Ford India said. Mahindra & Mahindra’s sales were down 1.5 per cent to 34,310 units. “The auto industry continues to go through challenging times, grappling with the short-term effects of demonetisation as well as reduced and postponed purchase decisions. However, we believe there will be a gradual pick-up in demand starting next few months,” M&M Chief Executive (auto division) Pravin Shah said, adding that implementation of GST along with some right initiatives taken by the government in the upcoming Union Budget will provide a veritable boost to the auto industry and the economy in general. Tata Motors said domestic sales of its commercial and passenger vehicles grew by one per cent to 35,825 units in December 2016. It added that passenger vehicle sales in grew 35 per cent to 10,827 units last month year-on-year, while car sales grew by 40 per cent “due to strong demand for the Tata Tiago.” Mayank Pareek, President, Passenger Vehicle Business at Tata Motors said, “We continued our growth momentum in December on the back of robust sales, led by positive response for the Tata Tiago. This has resulted in planned stock reduction in the network. We also saw good traction on retail sales towards the end of the month.” Renault India sold 11,244 units in December 2016, a growth of 9.2 per cent against 10,292 units in the same month last year, while Volkswagen sold 4,348 cars in India against 2,577 units. Nissan India sold 3,711 units, a 21 per cent increase year-on-year. Arun Malhotra, Managing Director, Nissan Motor India said, “Nissan India achieved healthy sales in December by posting 21 per cent year-on-year growth despite the challenges of the demonetisation issue.”“The inventory planning is done much in advance by the car manufacturers. A company cannot deviate from the inventory flow suddenly. “The sales reflect existing supply chain in the work. Retail impact, which will be short-term, may be seen in January-March quarter,” according to Amit Kaushik, Managing Director (India) at auto consultancy firm Urban Science. He stressed that the impact will be short-term as the consumer sentiment remains positive. “The sector can further get a boost if some sops are announced in the upcoming budget,” he said. In the two-wheeler segment, Bajaj Auto reported 11 per cent dip in domestic motorcycles sales at 1,06,665 units, while India Yamaha Motor reported a 28 per cent increase in sales to 49,775 units. Royal Enfield posted 41 per cent increase in its domestic sales at 56,316 units.

1166,2017-01-02,56.0,Demonetisation hits manufacturing sector,"Companies also faced tough conditions in external markets, with new business from abroad falling.   Demonetisation of high-value currency notes in November has begun to hit the manufacturing sector, according to a private sector survey. The Nikkei India Manufacturing Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) fell to 49.6 in December, the first time it hit below the 50-mark in 2016, from 52.3 in November. A reading below 50 implies contraction while one above 50 indicates expansion. “PMI data for December indicated that the rupee demonetisation took a toll on manufacturing performance,” the report by Nikkei said. “Companies saw new work and output dip for the first time in 2016. In turn, quantities of purchases were scaled back and employment lowered. Meanwhile, input costs increased at a quicker rate, whereas output charge inflation eased.” “Having held its ground in November following the unexpected withdrawal of ₹500 and ₹1,000 bank notes from circulation, India’s manufacturing industry slid into contraction at the end of 2016,” said Pollyanna De Lima, Economist,HIS Markit and author of the report. “Shortages of money in the economy steered output and new orders in the wrong direction, thereby interrupting a continuous sequence of growth that had been seen throughout 2016.” “Cash flow issues among firms also led to reductions in purchasing activity and employment,” Ms De Lima added. The respondents said that the withdrawal of high-value rupee notes caused the downturn in December since shortage of cash had resulted in a lower number of new orders. “Rates of contraction in new work and production were marginal overall, but in both cases the reductions were the first in 2016,” the report added. “Businesses also highlighted challenging conditions in external markets, with a fall in new business from abroad ending a six-month sequence of growth.” Order backlogs rose for the seventh consecutive month but at the slowest rate in this sequence, according to the report. “As the survey showed only a mild decline in manufacturing production in the last month of the year, the average reading for the October-December quarter remained in growth terrain, thereby suggesting a positive contribution from the sector to overall GDP in Q3 FY17,” Ms. De Lima said. “With the window for exchanging notes having closed at the end of December, January data will be key in showing whether the sector will see a quick rebound.” Printable version | Jan 7, 2017 1:49:31 AM | http://www.thehindu.com/business/Economy/Demonetisation-hits-manufacturing-sector/article16979062.ece © The Hindu Following the withdrawal of high-value currency notes, activity at PoS terminals saw exponential growth, even as the number of new such machines installed has also gone up."
1167,2017-01-02,56.0,Protest at RBI over currency exchange,"A large number of people had showed up at the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) office on Nrupathunga Road in Bengaluru on Monday to exchange old Rs 500 and Rs 1000 currency notes.  
| Photo Credit: K_MURALI_KUMAR Bengaluru: Over a hundred people from across the State, who had gone to the Reserve Bank of India office on Monday afternoon assuming that they could exchange demonetised currency, staged an impromptu protest after bank officials refused to take the notes. The police had to be called in to disperse the crowd when the situation got tense. After waiting for two hours in a queue outside the gate of the RBI office on Nrupathunga Road, citizens were informed by officials that the bank is not authorised to exchange notes in Bengaluru. “The Centre had extended the deadline for currency exchange up to March 31, but the facility is available only in offices of the Reserve Bank in Mumbai, New Delhi, Chennai, Kolkata and Nagpur,” said a senior police officer. After learning that they had wasted two hours, the customers started shouting slogans and created a ruckus following which the jurisdictional Halasuru Gate police were summoned to disperse the crowd. ""It was a communication gap that caused the fracas. The officials concerned failed to clarify the Centre’s ordinance to the people who ended up waiting for two hours,” said a police officer. The police have requested bank officials to put up a notice at the gate clearly stating that they can not exchange currency.

1168,2017-01-02,56.0,Demonetisation was for political gain: Minister,"Minister for Law and Parliamentary Affairs T.B. Jayachandra today lashed out at Prime Minister Narendra Modi, saying that demonetisation was not done in the interest of the country but for political gain and keeping in view the upcoming Assembly elections in Uttar Pradesh and other States. At a press conference in Tumakuru city, Mr. Jayachandra alleged that the Union government has given a benefit of Rs.5 lakh crore in the form of loan waiver to corporate companies. He said that Mr. Modi did not express any regrets towards the inconvenience caused to the people post-demonetisation in his recent address to the nation. “Mr. Modi’s body language during the speech itself showed his guilty consciousness about demonetisation. The Prime Minister did not say anything about the amount of black money or fake currency recovered through demonetisation. And there was no mention of giving compensation to the 115 people who died while standing in queues in banks to withdraw money.” The Minister said the Parliament session took place for one month after Mr. Modi announced demonetisation but the Prime Minister did not speak in Parliament, which is a “great insult to democracy and shows the attitude of a dictator.” Mr. Modi had said that black money and fake currency are the biggest threat to the nation hence demonetisation was done but he did not give a single statement in Parliament about it. Mr.Jayachandra said that in the last two-and-a-half years, Mr. Modi has spoken only thrice in Parliament but makes lots of speeches in foreign countries where the audience are Indians and not foreigners. ‘Jobless’ The Minister said more than four lakh people have become jobless in the country after demonetisation was announced and 60 per cent of the people who lost jobs are daily wage workers including agricultural labourers. He felt that it is not easy to go cashless in the country where the banking sector has reached only 27 per cent of the population. He said demonetisation is going to cause the State’s exchequer about Rs.6,000 crore. MLA Rafiq Ahmed, district Congress president Ramakrishna and others were present.

Shivaram on Monday demanded an apology from Prime Minister Narendra Modi to the nation for his “failed demonetisation policy”. They were addressing a joint press conference here. Mr. Manju, who is also the Minister in charge of Hassan, said demonetisation had helped only the rich, leaving the poor to stand in queue for hours and suffer. “We were expecting the PM to announce some relief for those suffered for the past 50 days. But he disappointed all of us. The Union government should credit at least ₹20,000 each to all the BPL families for their suffering,” he said. Mr. Shivaram said the PM’s speech on December 31 was a flop. He said citizens had expected him to give a report on demonetisation in his speech. “The Congress is demanding a white paper on demonetisation and relief for the affected. The Prime Minister did not bother to acknowledge the deaths caused by his policy. More than 100 people have died struggling for cash,” he said. The Congress has decided to hold nationwide protests against the PM’s policies on January 7 and 9. M. Vishwanathan, fformer Lok Sabha member from Tamil Nadu, has been appointed an observer to oversee the protests in Hassan, Chikkamagaluru and Shivamogga districts. Mr. Vishwanathan said, “The party will stage a dharna in front of the offices of all district collectors across the country on January 7. Workers of the party’s women’s wing will stage a protest on January 9.” S.M. Anand, former MLC, was among those present.

The Reserve Bank of India feels this query cannot be answered under the Right to Information Act as it does not come under the definition of information under the transparency law. The applicant wanted to know whether the views of Chief Economic Adviser Arvind Subramanian and Finance Minister Arun Jaitley were taken before the announcement was made. “The query is in the nature of seeking opinion from the CPIO which is not defined as information as per Section 2(f) of the RTI Act,” the RBI said in response to an RTI query. Asked whether the information sought will fall under “seeking opinion” from the CPIO, former Chief Information Commissioner A.N. Tiwari said, “No. It does not. It is a fact sought by an RTI applicant. The CPIO cannot say an opinion has been sought from him.” “How it can be called seeking opinion? Whether someone was consulted or not is a matter of record. Had the question been that should views be taken then it would mean taking opinion,” former Information Commissioner Shailesh Gandhi said, expressing surprise at the response of the RBI Central Public Information Officer. The query was also sent to the Prime Minister’s Office and the Finance Ministry but it remained unanswered. — PTI Printable version | Jan 7, 2017 1:51:14 AM | http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/RBI-doesn%E2%80%99t-divulge-if-Jaitley-had-a-say-on-demonetisation/article16974875.ece © The Hindu Be it nature’s fury or man’s folly, destructions are alike.

1171,2017-01-02,56.0,"CM slams Modi, says demonetisation biggest scam of India","Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal on Sunday demanded a “white paper” and an independent inquiry into Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s demonetisation decision. Calling it the “scam of all scams” even as he claimed that the reputation of Prime Minister’s Office had been tarnished globally under Narendra Modi, Mr. Kejriwal said Mr. Modi’s speech on Saturday was a sham. The Chief Minister has sought answers from the Prime Minister and the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) on the amount of money deposited and the eventual gain out of the 50 days after demonetisation was announced on November 8. “Demonetisation is the biggest scam of India, and is entirely guided by politics and corruption. We demand that an independent inquiry be conducted and a white paper be released on the what was gained and lost due to demonetisation,” Mr. Kejriwal said at a press conference held at his residence in Civil Lines. Allegations against PM Later in the day, he addressed a rally in Rohtak, Haryana, against Mr. Modi and his demonetisation decision. Mr. Kejriwal also levelled allegations of corruption against the Prime Minister. “The PM has become a subject of ridicule internationally. Big economists of the world are talking ill about the whole exercise. Manmohan Singh commanded respect internationally, but Mr. Modi has destroyed the reputation of the PM’s office,” he said. Referring to Mr. Modi’s December 31 address to the nation, he said it was hollow as he did not speak about the gains and losses arising out of the shock currency move. The schemes could have been announced even without enforcing any such measure, he said. ‘No check on corruption’ Mocking Mr. Modi and his decision, Mr. Kejriwal said the Prime Minister had said it would achieve four objectives — reduce corruption, curb black money, reduce terrorism and circulation of fake currency. “It has neither managed to curb black money nor reduce terrorism or circulation of counterfeit currency, as fake ₹2,000 notes are available in the market. It has not yielded any benefits and has instead led to a spike in corruption,” Mr. Kejriwal claimed. Questioning Mr. Modi’s moral responsibility over the death of around 100 people while standing in queues outside banks, he said people’s lives had been ruined. “It is a matter of inquiry whether bribe was taken for leaking prior information about demonetisation or was it shared for free. The BJP has been running the racket of exchanging notes. All his [Modi] rich friends were informed in advance about it,” he said. ‘Make BJP cashless’ “Mr. Modi is talking about a cashless economy. But first he should make the BJP cashless. There’s a list of 648 people who have Swiss bank accounts. He should have announced that these people will be arrested,” he said.

1172,2017-01-02,56.0,The chilling effect of demonetisation,"The row of Tibetan hawkers selling sweaters and jackets across the road from Chhatrapati Shivaji Terminus is hard to miss. Each year, a few hundred Tibetan exiles — mainly from Mundgod in Karnataka, one of the biggest settlements of this refugee community in India — make a trip to the city to spend a few months selling winter-wear. Their winter earnings are a substantial part of the community’s annual income; the rest of the year, they sustain themselves with labour and farming work. Their vendors source their merchandise from Ludhiana, Punjab, the hub of the woollen garment industry in India, and sell it in markets around the country. In Mumbai, they usually rent rooms in the Parel area, where most of the local community is based. To help with their trade, they also bring with them non-Tibetan residents of Mundgod, with whom the community has built strong relationships over the decades of their exile. Despite Mumbai’s mild winters, the selling skills and warm smiles of the Tibetans see them do steady business on the city, and their coming is something Mumbai office-goers look forward to. That iconic city chronicler, Behram Contractor a.k.a. Busybee, would refer to them as a sign of approaching winter in the city. “My family has been in this business since 1965 when we migrated to India from Tibet,” says Phurbu Dolma, is as at home in Mumbai as she is in Mundgod. “I myself have been coming to Mumbai since around 3 decades every year.” This year, however, the Tibetans have to overcome problem no one could have anticipated. Just as they had settled into the city, the Prime Minister’s demonetisation announcement brought a chill to street vendors nation-wide. Like those in the informal sector everywhere, the Tibetans aren’t equipped to handle card payments or bank transfers. Many of them have been relying on old relationships with their suppliers in Ludhiana, who have helped them by taking demonetised notes from them as payment. “The business was obviously hit,” says Annu Kamar, of the Mumbai Tibetan Sweater Sellers association. “People naturally stopped spending money on the goods we sell because of the cash crunch. Business in the Parel market has gone down by 50 per cent as of now.” “While last year I had recorded an earning of Rs. 60,000 to 70,000, this year I expect to earn around Rs. 30,000 if things improve,” says Tsering Ngodup (46). Thinlay Gyatso takes a break from shouting orders to his helpers to say, “People don’t have money to buy vegetables and rations. Plus, there isn’t much of a winter in the city.” The Tibetan government-in-exile in Dharamsala, Himachal Pradesh, has advised the community to support the demonetisation decision of the Indian government, Karma Yeshi, its Finance Minister, told The Hindu. “By and large, the Tibetan community in exile are extremely grateful to the Government and people of India for their support. The Tibetan Charter in Exile Article 6 says, ‘Tibetans will follow international rules and regulations of the Government of the land where they live.’ We respect the decision taken by the Government of India which is taken at the larger interest of the nation. As of now I do not think or do not have knowledge of how much the decision of demonetisation has affected the community. Just like Indians face temporary hardship, we in exile too face similar hardship.” In their daily effort to make ends meet, the community’s long-term hopes for their homeland still live. As Mr. Ngodup says, “I struggle every day with the hopes that my children get good education and one day become leaders in the political movement of our community.”   The writer is an intern at The Hindu Printable version | Jan 7, 2017 1:51:16 AM | http://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/The-chilling-effect-of-demonetisation/article16974647.ece1 © The Hindu SamBar, the new resto-bar that’s replaced Khar’s Loca Loca, has inventive cocktails and fun finger food inspired by the cuisine from south of the Vindhyas"
1173,2017-01-03,57.0,Cong. demo against demonetisation on Dec.6,"Congress MP Nandi Yellaiah has said the party will organise protest demonstrations at all district collectorates in the State resenting the demonetisation decision by Prime Minister Narendra Modi. The demonetisation badly affected the lives of the poor and middle classes. The life came to a standstill in rural areas, while farmers, agricultural labour and petty vendors were badly hit. The BJP did not bring any new welfare programme but only proved costly to the people in the country. Mr. Modi, who promised to bring back black money from foreign banks and give Rs. 15 lakh to each citizen, failed to deliver, he said. Instead of tackling the money hoarders, he punished people of the country terribly. The Congress party has decided to protest the demonetisation move and mobilise people against the dictatorial attitude of the Prime Minister, he said. “Mr. Modi avoided Parliament and did not answer queries of the Opposition members. If his decision was sound, he should have faced the Opposition and clarified the doubts,” Mr. Yellaiah said. The BJP Government at Centre was taking unilateral decisions, he opined and added that it was not taking the Opposition into confidence. “As a result of anti-people policies, the common man was burdened. The citizens saw the true colours of Mr. Modi as they know what he spoke before and after elections,” he observed. People now desire that Congress party comes to power both in the State and at the Centre. Going by the aspirations and sentiments of people, the Congress party had taken up the campaign against demonetisation on a large scale across the country. On January 6 the party would organise protest demonstrations in Telangana as well. District Congress Committee president N. Rajender Reddy, senior leader Katla Srinivas, E. Swarna, Rajanala Srihari, E.V. Srinivas and others were present.

Sources said those examined were the owner of the mobile phone shop where the accused had attempted to exchange the fake notes and the owners of the house where they had stayed in Malappuram. The court is slated to examine two more witnesses on Wednesday. The court had already framed charges against the accused, identified as Masidur Rahaman alias Muhammed Masuideen; Mojammel Hoque alias Bablu; Farman Ali; Masud Alam; Shish Muhammed — all natives of Malda in West Bengal, and Mojibur Rahaman, alias Mujeeb. It was on September 17, 2012 that the Manjeri police arrested Masidur Rahaman while attempting to exchange a fake note of ₹1,000 at mobile phone shop. During a follow-up investigation, the police recovered 45 fake Indian currency notes of similar denomination from his residence and arrested the remaining members of the racket. The case was later handed over to the NIA, which found that the counterfeits had been printed in Pakistan and were pumped into India through Malda, a district in West Bengal that shares its border with Bangladesh.

The intelligence information received by us shows their problems have increased. Their strength has reduced,” Singh said. On November 8, the government had announced that Rs. 1000 and Rs. 500 notes ceased to be legal tender. When asked about the attack on women in Bengaluru on New Year’s eve, Singh said, “It is not possible to keep seeking reports from the state on every issue. I believe that protecting the modesty of women is the duty of every state government and they should take it seriously.” On the issue of recent riots in West Bengal, Singh said ministry is in the know of every big problem. “We don’t do politics of confrontation. We will talk it out,” he said when asked about reports of a rift between the West Bengal government and the Centre. He also refused to give any clear response whether his views were taken on the issue of demonetisation.

This time around though, following demonetisation, tour bookings have seen a dip, say travel agents. “Bookings have not yet completely picked up. Enquiries are coming in from honeymooning couples and corporate travel will pick up from February, but there is a 30 to 40 per cent dip compared to last year. November to January is our peak season as families and couples book for Christmas, New Year and weekends away and this was hit,” said Pawan Gupta, managing director, PK Holidays. Priya Menon, owner, Aaditya Tours and Travels, said that bookings were still not yet full-fledged. “We have seen a 10 per cent drop from last year,” she said. “We had some cancellations after demonetisation and there has been approximately a 25 per cent drop in business compared to last year,” said Venkatraman Suresh, senior manager, Akshaya India Tours and Travels. Things were picking up slowly, he said. Since international travel packages are often booked a month or month and a half in advance, fewer travellers are going abroad, said Tushar Jain, managing partner, Roundtrip.in. “From November 10 to December 10, travel was severely hit, but since then, it has been improving,” he said. Some travellers who may have gone abroad are looking at domestic options, said Tejas Gupta, director, Travel Air Madras. “People who had decided to go are continuing to do so, but new queries have reduced,” he said. Currency exchange restrictions had impacted inbound tourism, agents said. In November, UK, Canada and Australia had updated their travel advisories to citizens warning them not to accept notes taken out of circulation and to expect long lines at banks and ATMs. The Canadian website, updated on December 7, states, “If you plan to travel to India, do not depend on cash as the sole method of payment.” The Australian government’s website cautioned similarly, while the U.K. advisory, updated on December 31, advised travellers to use debit or credit cards.

Venkaiah Naidu said on Monday that the move has started to yield results like reduction in interest rates by banks. “Money is coming into the system. Whether the old notes are deposited into the bank or not, notes are now coming into the open,” he said at an interaction with journalists at The Hindu office here. “More money is coming into the system and into the tax net. More people coming into the tax net means tax rates will come down.” The government was determined to go after errant people, scrutinise unusual deposits and plug leakages. But Mr. Modi did not have a magic wand to eradicate leakages, he said. Though he admitted that it was painful to see people waiting in queues to get their own money, he believed that people had now forgotten the pain. Their confidence in Mr. Modi had increased. Mr. Naidu also dismissed speculations that the government intended to put money into people’s accounts as an incentive after the demonetisation exercise. “Though, I am not the final word, knowing the Prime Minister’s mind, he is not for giving anything free. He is for incentivising schemes for development. Already, he has announced interest subvention for housing”. Mr. Modi, he said, believed in giving more power to the States as part of “cooperative federalism.” “The system has changed now. States come forward with their development plans and the Centre sanctions the plan if it is in accordance with the guidelines,” he explained.

The RSS brass, including its Sarsanghachalak (chief) Mohan Bhagwat and Sarkaryavah Suresh ‘Bhaiyaji’ Joshi, will sit down with the BJP’s senior general secretaries Ram Lal and Ram Madhav for the first of the three review meetings a year to be held in Ahmedabad on January 4 and 5, a day before the BJP kicks off its national executive meeting in New Delhi. Top sources in the Sangh Parivar have confirmed that the meeting will review the events of the year gone by, especially demonetisation and its likely impact on the situation on the ground this year. “Several affiliates of the RSS — such as the Bharatiya Kisan Sangh, the Bharatiya Mazdoor Sangh and the Swadeshi Jagaran Manch — expressed reservation about the impact of demonetisation on various sectors. The issues thrown up by demonetisation will also be discussed,” a source said. “While the RSS has had many discussions unofficially, this will be the first structured meeting,” he said. Mr. Mohan Bhagwat is, in fact, touring Gujarat now. The BJP national executive will meet on January 6 and 7, the first time since the government announced demonetisation. “Demonetisation will dominate the proceedings here, too, with a separate resolution on the issue, thanking the government and Prime Minister Narendra Modi for its tough stance on corruption,” said a source in the party. “A second, omnibus political resolution will also be moved, and it will specifically mention the obstructive behaviour of the Opposition during the just-concluded winter session of Parliament,” the source said. “Obviously, the preparations for the elections in Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Punjab, Goa and Manipur will also be discussed,” said a party office-bearer.

1181,2017-01-03,57.0,Congress plans protests against demonetisation,"Upping the ante against the demonetisation-induced cash crisis, All India Congress Committee (AICC) member P C Vishnunath flayed Prime Minister Narendra Modi for allegedly leaving crores of poor people mainly toiling masses, worst hit by demonetisation across the country, in the lurch even after the expiry of the 50-day time sought by him to end the cash woes. Mr Vishnunath, who is the convener of the party zonal committee on anti-demonetisation campaign, reviewed the arrangements for the ensuing month-long anti-demonetisation protest programmes, at a meeting held at the District Congress Committee office here on Monday. Telangana Pradesh Congress Committee (TPCC) working president Mallu Bhatti Vikramarka, vice-president D. Sridhar Babu, the party deputy floor leader in the Legislative Council P. Sudhakar Reddy, TPCC general secretary Syed Azmatullah and others were present. Mr. Vishnunath said the Congress party will hold dharnas in all district headquarters towns, including Khammam, across the country on January 7 to protest against the “unabated demonetisation woes.” A series of protest programmes will be organised all over the country for the next one month as part of the first phase of nation-wide anti-demonetisation campaign, he said. Terming the demonetisation exercise as the “biggest scam” orchestrated by some big corporate entities, Mr. Vikramarka alleged that the “draconian move” played havoc with the lives of millions of poor people depriving them of their means of livelihood across the country. People’s woes Millions of people in the country have been reeling under cash woes unable to withdraw their hard-earned money from the banks even as the black money hoarders remained unaffected, he charged. Mr. Sridhar Babu called upon the rank and file of the party to actively spearhead the anti-demonetisation protest programmes to highlight the plight of millions of people particularly farmers, agricultural labourers, street vendors and workers in unorganised sector, hard hit by demonetisation. Earlier, the speakers at the review meeting demanded that the Centre release a white paper on demonetisation, remove restrictions on withdrawal of money from banks, and implement concrete measures to provide succour to poor people badly affected by the move.

1182,2017-01-03,57.0,"Demonetisation a historic blunder, says Karnataka Minister","Minister for Medical Education Sharanprakash Patil addressing presspersons in Kalaburagi on Monday.
  Minister for Medical Education Sharanprakash Patil has termed the Union government’s ban on high denomination currency as a historic blunder. Addressing a press conference here on Monday, the Minister said that the “short-sighted move” would adversely impact the economy in the long run. Pointing at the proclaimed purposes of demonetisation – curbing black money and counterfeit notes and drying sources of terror funding, Mr. Patil demanded that the Union government present a White Paper on the issue. “How much black money is unearthed after demonetisation? How much economic loss has been incurred and how many new jobs have been created? How many people have lost their lives thanks to the crisis after November 8 and why compensation is not paid to the families of the victims? What consultations and preparations were made before enforcing demonetisation? And can the Union government make public the names of people who have deposited Rs. 25 lakh or more in bank accounts in the last six months?,” he said. Mr. Patil attributed the BJP’s reluctance to debate the issue in Parliament to its fear of cross-voting from its own members. “BJP parliamentarians too are opposed to demonetisation. That is why the party is not ready to put the issue for voting in Parliament. It is not ready to debate the issue even in the Lok Sabha where it has a majority,” he said. To a question, Mr. Patil said that that the stress on cashless economy was an afterthought to cover up the Union government’s failure in addressing currency crisis caused by demonetisation. “Ill-prepared demonetisation of high denomination resulted in currency shortage and led to inconvenience. People will have to continue to suffer as it takes at least a year to print notes to fill the gap created by demonetisation. In order to cover up its failure, the idea of cashless economy through digital transaction is floated to divert the people’s attention,” he said. The idea, he added, was bound to fail as an overwhelming majority of people in the country don’t have bank accounts, debit cards or smart phones to carry out cashless transactions. “It is the only country in the world where common people have restrictions to get their own hard-earned money from banks,” he said. Responding to a question, Mr. Patil slammed the BJP for unleashing attacks on critics of demonetisation in the social media.

Anindito Mukherjee Currency crisis crippled the functioning of treasuries in the State on the second consecutive day on Wednesday. The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) could provide only 64 per cent of the cash demand placed by the government for meeting the day’s commitments. Finance Minister T.M. Thomas Isaac’s office informed that against the demand for ₹201.96 crore, the RBI could provide only ₹130 crore making use of the balance and the day’s revenue, treasuries disbursed ₹645.3 crore. This system helped to prevent a disruption in payments. As many as 41,286 pensioners withdrew ₹74.49 crore. Employees as well as other Treasury Savings Bank account holders comprising 6,500 persons withdrew ₹17.36 crore. Welfare pensions worth ₹36.8 crore and ₹516.6 crore was disbursed for the needs of various departments.

1184,2017-01-04,58.0,Demonetisation: KCR told to walk the talk,"The time has come for Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao to walk the talk, as he promised on the floor of the House that he himself will lead the movement if the hardships of common people due to demonetisation did not ease even after 50 days, said Deputy leader in the Legislative Council Ponguleti Sudhakar Reddy. Mr. Chandrasekhara Rao, during his reply on the short discussion on Demonetisation in the House, had said that the Prime Minister expected several benefits from demonetisation and he asked the countrymen to give him 50 days’ time. “I came from people’s movement and will not hesitate to lead the movement again if people’s hardships persist,” the Chief Minister had said then. Quoting the Chief Minister’s words, Mr. Sudhakar Reddy said even after the 50-day time sought by the Prime Minister, there was no relief to the people. Livelihoods of common people were disrupted and small vendors’ sales were severely hit, farmers were unable to get loans and labourers their wages due to demonetisation impact, he said. Inputs The Chief Minister would have got intelligence inputs by now on how the poorly thought out demonetisation move by the Centre had played havoc with the lives of commoners and vulnerable sections of society. There was not enough cash and POS machines and people were unable to withdraw their own money while patients suffered in hospitals and people had to postpone marriages.
